title: The Weekly Review
description: An introduction to the weekly review from David Allen's Getting Things Done methodology, specifically applied to undergraduate life. 
---

For many, college is a time of increased freedom and choices about how they will spend their time. When you enter college as a freshman, it seems that very few hours in the day are preallocated to school, sports, or other extracurriculars. For much less time in the day than in high school, no one is forcing you to be anywhere, at any time. Even class is optional!

This is exciting -- there's so much to experience on a college campus, and now you have the freedom to explore! But this newfound freedom can often be misinterpreted, because, for many, college is the time when a fundamental shift takes place. Up through senior year of high school, most responsibilities that an individual might have were structured for them. Meeting responsibilities in large part meant showing up and meeting deadlines that were designed to be completed in 1-5 days. 

This isn't to say that meeting these responsibilities was *easy*; rather, much of the time management decisions required in college were unnecessary. Constant reminders and suggestions from authority figures such as teachers and parents replaced questions like "what should I do today?" or "What do I need to do to be successful on this assignment?"

This portrait doesn't match everyone's experience -- but in general, the transition to college requires an increase in time management ability on the part of the student. And one of the most effective tools that I've found to match this requirement is the *weekly review*. The weekly review as I know it is a part of David Allen's [Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) to time management. In short, the weekly review is a consistent appointment you set with yourself to help you keep moving forward on your responsibilities and goals. I've found it to be a critical tool for staying aware of my top priorities and [living a diligent life]({% post_url 2016-07-24-diligence-in-proverbs %}). 

The rest of this post discusses the different components of my weekly review. I'll start by defining some of the terms and concepts from GTD, which are useful for the rest of the discussion. I'll then explain the weekly review at a high level. After that, I'll go into more detail on individual steps, and some of the different tools required for success. Finally, I'll demonstrate an example of what a weekly review might look like.

## Definitions

Note: pretty much all of this is coming out of David Allen's book 

**Inbox**: Your inbox is the place where you put anything that's holding your attention. In reality, this may be a couple of a different places. For me, my "inbox" is composed of my email inbox, a physical basket I can dump papers in, and the inbox section of [Todoist](https://todoist.com), my task manager app. The point is that you (a) have a place where you can dump/jot down anything that's on your mind, and (b) that this place is contained: you know that when you hit the bottom of your inbox, that there's nothing else floating around.

**Task**: Tasks are *actions* that can be *done*. Examples would include:
 - Clean laundry
 - Go to office hours to ask questions about Homework 5
 - Read chapters 8 and 9 of *Crime and Punishment*.
The main benefit of defining a task is because it helps us understand what projects are.

**Project**: Projects are collections of tasks (i.e. 2 or more). They *cannot* be done in the same way that a task can be. For example, you can "clean laundry" (a task), but you can't "apply for scholarships". Applying for scholarships is a multi-step process composed of tasks such as "search university database for potential scholarships to apply to," "fill out application form", "draft personal reflection essay", etc. Each of these tasks can be done, but the project itself can only be completed by completing each task. Thinking of projects and tasks in this way is helpful because it helps to answer the question "what's the next action?", one of the key questions to ask to continually make progress on the many responsibilities and goals you have. 

**Appointment**: An appointment is any kind of commitment you have that would go on your calendar - somewhere you have to be at a specific time. These generally consist of meetings, classes, and the like.

**System**: Your system is the tools and processes you use to manage the various tasks and projects in your life. The point of having a system is so that you have some place other than your head to store all your tasks, projects, appointments etc. This allows you to focus on whatever you need to focus on, without spending mental energy remembering everything you need to do later. How your system will end up looking like is up to you, but the key is that you can trust it: in order for the system to do its job, you have to be able to put something in there and be able to stop thinking about it, because you know you'll see it when you need to. I use Google Calendar to keep track of appointments and [Todoist](https://todoist.com) to keep track of tasks and projects. 

## A high level overview

First, the obvious: a weekly review should be done roughly weekly. Crazy, right? Any longer than this and it can be easy to lose track of your projects. It's best to budget a couple of hours -- while it might seem awhile, it's easily worth it, and it's best to not feel crammed for time.

Now that you've sat down and are ready to start, **brain dump**. Search your mind for anything that's nagging you -- an assignment you need to finish, someone you need to talk to, the laundry you've been avoiding -- and put it in your inbox. Compile all of the materials that might hold tasks you need to complete -- class websites, notebooks, etc. -- and put those in your inbox as well, if they're not already.

Once you think you've brought everything together, **process what you have**. The goal of this step is to generate . For each item on your list, first consider if it even needs to be done. If not, toss it out! If so, then determine if you can complete it in 2-5 minutes. If so, do it, as it will take less time to actually complete the task then to store it in your system, retrieve it later, and do it then. 

If the item needs to be done and takes more than ~5 minutes, consider the following questions: What's the deadline? Is this a task or a project? If it's a project, what is the next task that needs to be done to move forward on the project? If it's a task, are there any tasks that need to be completed before this one?

# My weekly review

- Brain dump. What are all the things that I'm thinking about? Put them in my inbox.
- Process inbox. Each thing: if I can handle it in ~3-5 minutes, do it now. Otherwise: what project does this belong to? When does it need to be done? Does it need to be done? Someday/maybe?
  - Inbox can include - school folders, email, a physical inbox, task list inbox, and whatever else you might have where you store stuff.
- Go through projects (which are defined by my areas of focus). What is the current status? Are there tasks that I need to complete that have been languishing? Things that aren't in the project that should be? What needs to happen for this week to be successful?
	- For school, this is often when I'll check the homework for each class, etc.
- Review my schedule for the upcoming week. What are my commitments?
- Create a rough schedule of my week. Goal here: to act on my priorities, and to make sure what's most important happens. Also: to be proactive, so I'm not doing things the day before they're due. The goal is NOT to come up with a detailed plan that will rule my life. 
- Peek ahead to the upcoming weeks. Any exams coming up? Large work projects? Retreats or times that I'll be out of town? These may impact what you should focus on this week.
- Am I waiting on anyone for anything? Is anyone waiting on me for anything?

## Areas of focus/projects

A key part of my weekly review. I've basically done much of my prioritizing already. I also have a solid list which encompasses the vast majority of what I do in my life. This allows me to quickly scan through this list and see what my responsibilities are.

Might not be useful for *everyone* to be as fine-grained in this as I am. But you should have the key areas in your life covered. If you don't consider it, it will likely not happen. Work, school, personal growth [time with God ranks high on the list here], and relationships are the key areas, I would think.

 want to have some kind of mnemonic or list (mental or written down) that you can use as a tool to remember what you need to be focusing on.

Projects are a layer below areas of focus. Area of focus might be "school". Project would then be classes. It's often helpful to think of larger assignments as projects too. David Allen says anything that's more than one task is a project.

## On school

How do I specifically tackle staying on top of school projects?

Review current assignments. When are they due? How am I doing? Will I need help on any of them?
Review syllabi/upcoming assignments. When are they due? Do I need to get started on any of them this week? Are any of them due this week? 
Group projects? Do we need to meet? Is there work that needs to be done individually before we meet again? Is anyone waiting on me for something? Do I need to follow up with anyone about the project?

Prioritize. What will be some of my hardest assignments? What do I think, based off past experience or what teachers have told me, will take the most time? 

Resources. What resources are available to me for this assignment (e.g. campus resources, friends, study groups, etc.)? Do I anticipate that I'll need to utilize any of these resources for this assignment? If so, what do I need to do before going to that resource for it to be most useful (e.g. writing a rough draft before bringing it to the writing center)? When is that resource available? What is the turn-around time -- i.e. how much time should I allot between me going to this resource and the due date of the assignment?

## Misc. 
I use Todoist and Google Calendar. Todoist goes anywhere and facilitates really easy creation of projects and tasks. The best part of Google Calendar is reoccurring events, which I use heavily to schedule all of my classes and other weekly commitments (church, work commitments, etc.)

Someday/maybe list is a powerful way of getting things outside of your brain but still in a safe place. The key here is to review it on some regular interval.

## Random thoughts

Don't ignore things
	Don't be a thnee. Don't HUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHH

Have a place where you write stuff down	
	Best not to keep it in your head.

Can be helpful to do brain dumps, to get everything you're overwhelmed about on paper and can look at it.
	Often, just do it - right then.
	One thing at a time.

One not so effective tool: actually use email. 
	Check your email, and only leave the things in your inbox that you need to deal with.
	Best is to get it out of your inbox and attach it to a task.
	Get comfortable deleting emails

## Elizabeth's system

A calendar to put down things that are happening. Classes, events, etc. Really helpful to be able to see that instead of just having a list. Visual representation of how long it's going to take.

For assignments that are given to you:
	This is what my homework is
	This is when my homework is due
	Looking ahead to when exams are
	Look a couple of weeks ahead to know what's going to happen
	Plan how you're going to study for that exam (stay on top of homework, get help when you don't know what's going on)
	For writing courses, give yourself time

Do the easy things consistently.

Ask questions! Give yourself *time* to ask questions!

Think of it like a job. As your work. There's substantial work to be done out of class.
