title: How are we called to imitate Jesus and God the Father?

While reading *Decision Making and the Will of God* (Garry Friesman with J. Robin Maxson, Multnomah Publishers 1980), I came across an interesting footnote. Friesman is responding to the argument that because God seemed to have a "detailed life plan" for Jesus (God's "individual will" for Jesus), that God also has an individual will for each of us. He notes: 

> "The example of Christ is often used to support the idea of following an individual will of God. Traditional writers refer to the life of Christ, but they never give a detailed explanation of those areas where Christ's example is normative." (pg. 94)

Friesman agrees that this individual will is certainly possible for Jesus, noting the prophecies and several statements by Jesus that he does only what his Father tells him to do, or what he sees his Father doing. But then he says this:

> "But the uniqueness of Christ is so pervasive, it would behoove us to be cautious in suggesting those points at which Christ's life provides a normative example for the believer today. In the epistles, Christ is declared to be our example. But the extent to which He is our model is not open-ended. He is our example in specific ways. Whenever the Bible calls God, or Christ, our example, it delineates the area of likeness." (pg. 95)

This is fascinating! I had never noticed this -- that "whenever the Bible calls God, or Christ, our example, it delineates the area of likeness." Two questions come to mind for me when I hear this:

1. Is it true? Are there any places in the Bible where we are called to hold God/Jesus as our example where it does *not* delineate the area of likeness?
2. In what ways are we called to follow God's/Jesus' example?

Friesman notes these scriptures as examples of his point.

## In humility and service to others
- John 13:1-15
  - Jesus set us an example: we should wash one another's feet. 
  - Now, there's a thought here: do we take this literally, or not? Do we need to wash each other's feet? I think we... don't. Jesus performed a specific act of service to demonstrate the heart of service that we should have. But we can look into that. 

- Philippians 2:5-8
  - Called to imitate Jesus in his humility and servant heart.
  - P.S.: "Do *nothing* out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves." (!)

## In holiness and righteousness
- 1 Peter 1:15-16
  - "Be holy, as I am holy". Called to exemplify God's holiness. The scripture relates this to "not conforming to the evil desires" we had in our previous lives. 

- 1 John 3:3, 3:7
  - Friesman argues these scriptures hold Jesus as an example of purity and righteousness. I don't think that they're *examples* the way I tend to think of them. Generally, examples are like: "hey! You should do this. You should be like this guy." This seems to be drawing more of a comparison - "if you do this, look! You'll be like this guy." That may just be splitting hairs... 

## In love
- Ephesians 5:1-2
  - Called to "be imitators of God". How? By living a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

- Luke 6:35
  - Mercy. "But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. *Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.*" (See also Matthew 5:48)

- John 13:34-35

## In forgiveness
- Colossians 3:12-14
  - While this scripture calls us to a number of virtues: compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience (and love, later), we are called to "forgive as the Lord forgave you." 

- Ephesians 4:32
  - Forgiveness. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

## In suffering for doing good
- 1 Peter 2:21-24
  - Called to imitate Jesus in his suffering for doing God -- and also, I think in the *way* he suffered. "When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly."

## In giving
- 2 Corinthians 8:1-9
  - "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich." Called to mimic Jesus in his giving of himself, and mirror this in our giving of material possessions to support our brothers.

## In perseverance
- Hebrews 12:1-4 
  - Called to throw off sin and run with perseverance. To fix our eyes on Jesus. He endured, and we are called to consider him so that we will not grow weary ourself. Therefore, we are called to imitate Jesus' endurance. 


It's not just the specific areas, but the manner in which and the extent to which Jesus lived them out.
 
These examples don't preclude us imitating Jesus in other ways, of course. They do, however, provide a helpful indication of what aspects of Jesus' character we should emphasize in ourselves. The lack of any general "follow my example", if true, is a striking case against taking Jesus' life as an argument for the existence of God's individual will for us.

Other scriptures that I thought of:
