title: Do The Work

It's been a while since I've written here, primarily because my year at MIT has been one of the most intense in my life, both personally and in my education. I've learned a lot: about myself, about God and my relationship to him, about water resources engineering... I'm excited to share it here as I'm able to in the coming weeks and months. 

One thing I'm *also* excited for is school to end and the summer to begin. There are all sorts of things that I want to do and learn that I haven't been able to while I've been in grad school. Learning Spanish, learning more about Islam, beginning to chip away at my reading list that has been growing steadily for the past two years...

Maybe you're also entering or have just entered this summer period. Whether you're in college or not, you have something you'd like to accomplish over the next three months, whatever it might be. In your mind there's this picture of what a *great* summer would look like, and part of it is accomplishing that goal you have. How do you get to the end of that great summer--one where you've accomplished what you set out to do, or at least made more progress than you have ever have before?

**Do the work.**

It's easy to waste time planning, prepping, and talking about what you want to accomplish. But in order to actually get anything done, you need to *do something*. And while planning, prepping, and talking can feel like you're doing something, if you don't actually get out there and do the work, then the work won't get done. 

Sometimes we don't want to get started because we're afraid we won't do it the "right" or "best" way. But in the vast majority of the things we want to accomplish, just getting started and doing the work in whatever way you currently know how is a far more effective path to achieving your goals. Too often, looking for the "right" way turns into becoming overwhelmed with all of the options out there and not doing anything.

So: it's summer time. You've got something in mind that you want to do? 

Good. Now get out there and do the work.
