title: Getting Things Done in College - The Framework
layout: post
---

One of the most helpful things to me in my day-to-day life has been understanding how to effectively manage my time. I learned from my dad in high school about [*Getting Things Done*](http://gettingthingsdone.com/), a time management methodology invented by David Allen. Over time, I've implemented the principles of Getting Things Done in a way that works for me as a high school and now college student. 

While I initially intended to write a massive post that explains how I've done this, in looking around I found that [Cal Newport got there before me](http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/10/06/monday-master-class-getting-things-done-for-college-studentsmade-easy/). While we differ in details, in very few words Newport gives a view of the overall approach that I use myself.

As Newport mentions, if you already have a time management system that works for you, don't spend a lot of your energy trying to implement another one. On the other hand, if you're constantly overwhelmed, forget things, or can't seem to manage your responsibilities, then this is a good approach to consider. 

I've taken a look at some of the [other posts](http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/06/30/monday-master-class-a-crash-course-in-student-time-management/) on Newport's blog and would recommend them. Over here, I'll be doing my best to share some of my own time management experience. Much of my work as a Peer Mentor -- a live in position where I help first-year residents make the academic transition to college -- boils down to helping my residents manage their time more effectively. My aim is for my upcoming posts to distill much of this information in one place. 

In the meantime, read Newport's blog.
