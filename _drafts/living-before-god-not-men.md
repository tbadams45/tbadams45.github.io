> How can you belive if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the Only God? *John 5:44*

> You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being. *Revelation 4:11*
