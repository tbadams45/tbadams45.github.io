A couple of key points:
1. media consumption is an important part of our lives, and our walks with God 


## Scriptures

> *“I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. Ihave given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.* John 17:13-19

Jesus calls his followers not only to submit  behaviors to him, but my very thoughts and desires. Jesus has made his followers new  

> But you are chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. *1 Peter 2:9-12*

> Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God -- this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is -- his good, pleasing, and perfect will. **Romans 12:1-2**

> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world -- the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life -- comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever. *1 John 2:15-17*

> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable -- if anything is excellent or praiseworthy -- think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me -- put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. **Philippians 4:8-9**

> Since then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden wit Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. **Colossians 3:1-4**

> I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them. I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified. **John 17:13-19**

> Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." Therefore, "Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." And, "I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty." Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God. *2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1*

> Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.
That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither — whatever they do prospers. *Psalm 1*

## Questions to consider

- What would Jesus watch/listen to/read?
- How does me watching/listening/reading this bring glory, honor, or praise to God?
- If Jesus or an apostle walked into the room right now, would I turn this off?
- How can my "free time" be used in a way that brings glory to God’s name?
- In what ways can my media consumption be a blessing to others?
- Are there other ways in which I can be a blessing to others that are hindered by the type of media I consume? 
- Is the amount or type of media I am consuming helping or hindering my intimacy with God, particularly in prayer?
- How does the media I consume help me be an ambassador for God?
- Do I use media as a way to escape from my trials/struggles before I bring those things to God?
- What would my life look like if I decided to live for the next world instead of this one?
- What would my life look like if I internalized that I don’t belong to the world any more than Jesus?
