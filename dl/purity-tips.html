I thought it might be helpful to share some practicals I've implemented in my fight against impurity. These won't fight the battle for you, but they can be a powerful weapon.

All of these have one thing in common: removing myself from situations in which I might be tempted. I don't want to get to the point where I'm hovering over some link, trying not to click it. I want to run away from this sin.

1. No computer after 11. It's not the school year, so there's 0 reason for me to be doing this! I have no homework/deadlines.
2. No surfing on the internet on my phone. Going to specific pages I need to frequent, or googling an answer to a question I have is fine. I've made this easier by uninstalling all but the most basic browser on my phone so it's a pain to surf the web.
3. No using the phone while I'm on the toilet. No reason and it's a dangerously private place.
4. Using WasteNoTime (a google chrome extension) to (a) block sites that are not helpful for me and (b) limit my time at other sites. For example, I've blocked sites that I've found I get lazy on or I've often used to click the "first link" that gets me lusting. These include buzzfeed, huffington post, fusion, and 500px (a photo site). I've also limited the time I have on facebook: I've set it up so I can't access FB at all except between 4:00 and 11:00, and then only for 10 minutes. This allows me to use FB, see funny videos etc, but not stay on long enough I start infinite scrolling and am subconsciously looking for stuff to lust about. 
If you have any questions about this stuff, let me know. I'd be happy to show you how I set up WasteNoTime in particular, since it's been super super helpful. 

Keep up the fight, brothers and sisters.
