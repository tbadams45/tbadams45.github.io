title: Imitating Jesus' suffering

There are actually a number of ways we're called to imitate Jesus, and for that matter God. Rather than write an 80 page blog post, I thought we should focus on one at a time.

Our topic today centers around Jesus' suffering. If you're familiar with the Christian story, you've heard about some or all of it many times before: the betrayal by Judas; the abandonment by his other friends; the condemnation he didn't deserve; the flogging, beating, spitting, and insults he endured by the soldiers; carrying the cross; being nailed to the cross; the agonies of crucifixion; and the mocking of his accusers. These were the sufferings of Jesus. But what do they mean for us? 

First, let's look at two things Jesus said: 1. We're supposed to rejoice when we are persecuted (Mt 5), and 2. persecution is definitely going to come if we're following Jesus (Mt 10).

Now, let's look at what Hebrews says. 1. Jesus was made perfect by what he suffered. (Heb 2:9-10) 2. He learned obedience from what he suffered. 3. We are called to bear the same disgrace that Jesus bore. Why? "For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come."

## Looking at 1 Peter... Not sure what specifically. 

Peter discusses this extensively in his first letter. The explicit reference for us to imitate Jesus occurs in 1 Peter 2:21, but I'm going to quote a substantial chunk of the context surrounding it so you can understand the thrust of Peter's argument. As you read, ask yourself three questions:

1. *Who* is Peter speaking to?
2. *What* does he command them to do?
3. *Why* does he give these commands?

> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
> Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
> Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God’s slaves. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.
> Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of God. But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth." 
> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. "He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." For "you were like sheep going astray," but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. *1 Peter 2:9-25*

## Answering the questions

Who: God's elect, chosen people, holy priesthood, royal nation, God' special possession, people of God. Foreigners and exiles.
