{Isa 65:1; Rom 10:20}
92. And that He should become visible [282] among us—for the Son of God became Son of man—and be found of us who before had no knowledge (of Him), the Word Himself says thus in Isaiah: “I became manifest to them that sought me not; I was found of them that asked not for me. I said, Behold, here am I, to a race that called not on my name.” location 1902

{Mt 3:9; Ezek 36:26-27}
This also is that which was said by John the Baptist: “That God is able of these stones to raise up sons to Abraham.” For our hearts being withdrawn and taken away from the stony worship [284] by means of faith behold God, and become sons of Abraham, who was justified by faith. And therefore God says by Ezekiel the prophet: “And I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them: and I will withdraw and take away the stony heart from their flesh, and I will give them another heart of flesh: so that they shall walk in my precepts, and shall keep my ordinances and do them.” location 1909

{Isa 54:1}
because no longer Moses (as) mediator nor Elijah (as) messenger, [285] but the Lord Himself has redeemed us, granting many more children to the Church than to the first Synagogue; [286] as Isaiah declared, saying: “Rejoice thou barren, that didst not bear. The barren is the Church, which never at all in former times presented sons to God.” location 1919

{Isa 54:1}
“for the children of the desolate are more than of her which hath an husband.” Now the first Synagogue had as husband the Law. location 1924

{Deut 32:21; Rom 10:19}
Deuteronomy says that the Gentiles should be the head, and the unbelieving people the tail. And again he says: “Ye provoked me to jealousy with those that are no gods, and angered me with your idols: and I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, and with a foolish nation will I anger you.” (Cf. Rom. x. 19) Because they forsook the God who is, and worshipped and served the gods who are not; and they slew the prophets of God, and prophesied for Baal, who was the idol of the Canaanites. And the Son of God, who is, [287] they despised and condemned, but they chose Barabbas the robber who had been taken for murder: and the eternal King [288] they disavowed, and they acknowledged as their king the temporal Caesar. (So) it pleased God to grant their inheritance to the foolish Gentiles, location 1926

{Mt 23:37-39; Rom 8:10; Gal 3:23-25; Mt 5:17-48; Mt 6:1-34}
God has summed up again for Himself in us the faith of Abraham, we ought not to turn back any more—I mean, to the first Legislation. For we have received the Lord of the Law, the Son of God; and by faith in Him we learn to love God with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves. Now the love of God is far from all sin, [289] and love to the neighbor works no ill to the neighbor. (Cf. Rom xiii. 10) Wherefore also we need not the Law as a tutor. Behold, with the Father we speak, and in His presence we stand, being children in malice, [290] and grown strong in all righteousness and soberness. For no longer shall the Law say, “Do not commit adultery,” to him who has no desire at all for another's wife; and “Thou shalt not kill,” to him who has put away from himself all anger and enmity; (and) “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's field or ox or ass,” to those who have no care at all for earthly things, but store up the heavenly fruits: nor “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,” to him who counts no man his enemy, but all men his neighbors, and therefore cannot stretch out his hand at all for vengeance. location 1934

It will not require tithes of him who consecrates all his possessions to God, [291] leaving father and mother and all his kindred, and following the Word of God. And there will be no command to remain idle for one day of rest, to him who perpetually keeps sabbath, [292] that is to say, who in the temple of God, which is man's body, does service to God, and in every hour works righteousness. “For I desire mercy, He saith, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.” location 1946

97. By the invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, crucified under Pontius Pilate, [293] there is a separation and division among mankind; and wherever any of those who believe on Him shall invoke and call upon Him and do His will, He is near and present, fulfilling the requests of those who with pure hearts call upon Him. location 1956

Now by Jacob and Israel he means the Son of God, who received power from the Father over our life, and after having received this brought it down to us who were far off from Him, God. [299]  location 1970

{Eph 2:20}
This, beloved, is the preaching of the truth, and this is the manner of our redemption, and this is the way of life, which the prophets proclaimed, and Christ established, and the apostles delivered, and the Church in all the world hands on to her children. [300] This must we keep with all certainty, with a sound will and pleasing to God, with good works and right-willed disposition.  location 1973

and such also are reckoned among those who are lacking in faith. And others receive not the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and cast away from themselves the prophetic grace, [301] watered whereby man bears the fruit of life unto God: and these are they of whom Isaiah speaks: “For they shall be,” saith he, “as an oak that is stripped of leaves, and as a garden that hath no water.” And such are in no wise serviceable to God, seeing that they cannot bear any fruit. location 1982

100. So then in respect of the three points [302] of our seal [i.e., baptism], error has strayed widely from the truth. For either they reject the Father, or they accept not the Son and speak against the dispensation of His incarnation; or else they receive not the Spirit, that is, they reject prophecy. And of all such must we beware, location 1987
