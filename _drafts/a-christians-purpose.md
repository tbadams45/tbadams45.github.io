title: A Christian's Purpose
---

Also: Jesus' purpose! Because his purpose is our purpose. 

> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. *1 Peter 2:23-25*

> For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. *1 Peter 3:18*
