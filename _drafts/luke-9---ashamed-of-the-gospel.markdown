title: Luke 9 - Ashamed of the Gospel?

I've never quite understood Luke 9:18-27. I've felt like I've understood specific parts of it. There's a logic that appeals to me when Jesus asks his disciples a fundamental question.

> What good is it for a man to gain the whole world and yet lose or forfeit his very self?

Yes, that's nice. This is a question that's very easy to wrap up in a neat package and explain to people. Jesus is making a point about temporary rewards vs. heavenly rewards. What use is it to gain the whole world [for a short time], if you lose yourself [for eternity]? The answer, of course, is "there is none!"

But after this, Jesus says something else, in v27.

> I tell you the truth, some of you who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.

Most of the time, when people read 9:18-27, or 9:23-27... they don't. They stop at the end of v26. Why? I have two main reasons that I think this happens:

1. People have no clue what Jesus is talking about. How did the people see the kingdom of God before some of them experienced death? For some, this is even a concerning passage. Does this mean Jesus was supposed to have come back already?
2. This sentence doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the passage. Why is Jesus telling the disciples this? Why now?

Here's another thing. v26 is also often omitted when this scripture is read. Let's take a look at that.

> If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.

The question "why did Jesus say this, here?" is also relevant. But if we're going to answer that, we better not just look at one verse at a time. That way of looking at scripture greatly obfuscates seeing how all of these disparate ideas fit together.

So. All of v18-27.

> Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
>
> They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."
>
> "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
>
> Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
>
> Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
>
> Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."

These are *not* random sentences added together. It is easy to think like this. But Jesus does *not* say random, disjointed sentences together that can be taken on their own and fully understood. *No one speaks like that.*

So we have to understand the context of what's happening here to understand verses 26 and 27. 

Jesus asks the disciples a question. "Who do the crowds say I am?" And they answer, and so Jesus asks them a different question: "Who do you say I am?" So Peter says what maybe he's been waiting to say, has been eager to say this whole time. Or maybe he says it carefully, unconfidently, not wanting to be wrong, but hoping it's right. We don't really know. But we do know that he says "The Christ [Messiah] of God." 

So think about this. He's saying "you're the Messiah!" And this means a lot for the disciples. Remember, they argue later about who's going to be the greatest. They're thinking that this is a kingdom on earth. They ask Jesus in Acts "are you going to restore the kingdom of Israel?" They desperately want Israel to be back on top, and to reign with Jesus. So when Peter says "you're the Messiah!" all of those thoughts are rattling around in their brains.

But then Jesus says something totally weird! Totally bizarre! First off, he tells them not to tell anyone. Why ever not? Shouldn't they tell everyone? Shouldn't they start the revolution? Why do they have to keep it a secret? That's strange. But then, Jesus goes even farther. He says that he would have to suffer. That he's going to need to be rejected by the religious and cultural elite. That he's going to be *killed* (and raised to life - but they don't grasp what he means). This is not the Messiah they're expecting. This is not the Messiah *anyone* is expecting. 

Jesus continues. He says that "if anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me." Not only *Jesus* has to take up this cross, this torture device, but his *disciples* do too? Crazy! This is not the message they're expecting. 

Jesus makes the case for why. He explains "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?" The way to life, Jesus says, is found by following him. And the way to follow him is, somehow, incredibly, unbelievably, by self-sacrifice. Taking up the cross. Suffering in this life. In short, losing your life.

So it's with all of **this** said that Jesus says what is found in v26-27.

> If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the hold angels. I tell you truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Kingdom of God.

And now, with this context, what Jesus says here makes more sense. It would be easy to be ashamed of Jesus' words here. They're not just radical - they seem... foolish. Take up your cross? Lose your life? This is not a great rallying cry for the masses. This isn't a very pleasant kingdom that's being instituted. So Jesus reminds them - don't be ashamed of my words here. This life is not the one that matters. Though you might be ashamed when you stand before men because of this foolish message, this foolish gospel, remember that there will come a day when I will come in my glory, and will reign for eternity. It is *that* day you should prepare for. It is for the audience of God that you should live for - not the audience of men.

And as for v27? It continues on that same thread of logic. Jesus provides an assurance to the disciples. He says - you might be doubting, or you might think this is a hard pill to swallow. But some of you who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. You will see that what I say is true.

This has tremendous bearing on our lives today. At least for me, it's easy to be ashamed of the gospel. We preach a gospel that in many ways seems foolish. Our entire faith rests on a man who died outside Jerusalem around 30 AD. My hope for eternity lies with a man who died as a criminal. Add on top of that the current trend in the world (at least the (upper-middle-class) Northeast US) today. Religion is a crutch for the weak. It's a comfort to those who need it to get through a hard time. It's nice to believe that someone is going to save us. I hear all of these things and more. And in this place, it can be easy to be ashamed of the gospel.

But Jesus says: DO NOT BE ASHAMED. This is the gospel by which we are saved. 

Makes me think of a couple of verses that Paul wrote.

> For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. *Romans 1:16*

> For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will thwart the cleverness of the intelligent.” Where is the wise man? Where is the expert in the Mosaic law? Where is the debater of this age? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish? For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching. For Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks ask for wisdom, but we preach about a crucified Christ, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles. But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. *1 Corinthians 1:18-25*
