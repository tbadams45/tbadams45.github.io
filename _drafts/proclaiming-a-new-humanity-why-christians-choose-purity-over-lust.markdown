## The missing mission 

What is the mission statement of the church? Perhaps you have an answer to that question--perhaps not. If you do, are you satisified with your answer? Does it excite you, spur you into action? Do you believe it's a mission worth spreading? Is it a mission worth sacrificing your weekend for? What about your job--or your life? 

I once spoke with a campus minister after I had participated in one of his Bible talks. (A "Bible talk" is primarily focused on introducing people to Christianity who have never had any serious or positive exposure to the faith.) During the Bible talk, he had focused on the need to spread the good news and to help other people become disciples of Jesus. I agreed with his points, but something felt missing. In this introduction to the Christian faith, there was no discussion of what about this news was so *good*. So after, I asked him: "what's the point of being a disciple?" His answer: "The point of being a disciple is to make other disciples." 

The circularity of this statement troubled me, and it still does. It seemed to reduce the Christian faith to getting as many people as possible to join our club--just so we could have a big club. It felt empty, without the power to captivate me the way I knew it needed to. I knew at that moment that I could never give my life to a mission that was summed up in this way.

Fortunately, dear reader, Jesus offers us a substantially richer mission than "find members for my club." It *is* a mission worth spreading, sacrificing for, and giving up your life for. Yet I am concerned that many in the church do not share Jesus' mission. Perhaps we have traded it in for a cheap imitation, content with something less because it demands less in return. Perhaps we have decided it only applies to the "super-religous": the staff and elders and other leaders who we hold to a higher standard than we hold ourselves. Or perhaps we yearn for it and crave it but have simply never understood it; we have seen the pieces and have mistaken them for the whole. 

## Purity and lust 

The subtitle of this post is "why Christians choose purity over lust." This is not because sexual purity is the core of our mission. Rather, I have chosen to emphasize sexual purity because it is an area in which the church is currently experiencing remarkable defeats. I recently graduated and left the campus ministry. From my time in leadership, participating in anonymous surveys, and in conversations with a wide range of men, I would estimate that approximately half of the college men in our church are enslaved to sexual sin. By "enslaved," I mean that these men regularly seek out sexual content such as pornography or other erotic content to gratify their sexual desires. Regularly may mean daily, weekly, monthly, or perhaps 3-4 times a year--regardless of the frequency, it is consistency that I am higlighting here. My sense is that this percentage is somewhat lower as one examines older demographics (30s+), but that this is due less to anything substantially different in these groups and more to the fact that the majority of those who were enslaved to sexual sin earlier in their lives have left the church by the time they are in their 30s. (FOOTNOTE: I would love to be wrong about these estimates--if you believe they are off-base, let me know why at tim@tbadams.com. I have no good sense of what the situation is like for the women in our church beyond surveys of the broader Christian world, which say ____.)

Why are we experiencing these defeats? Certainly we must acknowledge that lust is one of the primary weapons that Satan uses to wage war against the church, alongside greed, selfishness, and pride. As any survey of the Bible or history goes, lust is a tremendous problem regardless of age or spiritual status (King David being one protoypical example, and the numerous sexual abuse scandals throughout the secualar world and Christian demominations being another). It is not something to be taken lightly, nor to assume that it is "someone else's problem." In my own fight against lust, I have seen that it is precisely in the moments where I am doing well and think I am invincible that I am most likely to fall. 

We must also acknowledge that the uniquity of the internet has given an extraordinary level of access to pornography, and that there has been an increasing embrace of a sexualized culture in the past century. To say that lust is new is laughable, but it is still true that the world we live in today provides an acceptance of lust and access to sexual content that is noticeably different from past centuries.

Yet regardless of the state of the world, it is clear that the church should be different. What is going on?
