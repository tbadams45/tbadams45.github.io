title: Getting Things Done in College - The Brain Dump
layout: post
---

I can often feel that my brain is cluttered. Especially once the semester gets rolling, there are so many different things I want to do and people that I want to talk to that I can't seem to hold it all in. This can lead to a lot of stress, as I spend a significant amount of my energy trying to remember, prioritize, and keep track of everything rattling around in my brain. Wouldn't it be better if I didn't have to do this? If I had a system that I could put these types of tasks and thoughts where I know they'll be dealt with, so I can focus on one thing at a time and be dedicate all of my energy to it? You're right. It would be.

Enter the *brain dump*. When I begin to feel this way, I'll spend a few minutes and note everything that I'm thinking about -- questions that I'm having, people I need to to talk to, homework I need to do, hikes I want to take, etc. Each time I think of something, I write it down. I don't stop until there's nothing rattling around in my brain anymore. The list that results is often 20 or 30 items long. It can get even longer if I haven't done a brain dump in awhile.

After the brain dump, of course, there's plenty more to be done: the next step involves prioritizing: what is most important? What is urgent and needs to be addressed right away? And without a trusted system, many of the benefits of the brain dump diminish, as you're not confident that the things you've just written down will actually be addressed. But even on it's own, the brain dump has advantages. Generally when I'm feeling particularly stressed, there are 1-3 items that are the main cause of my stress, and once I begin to chip away at those items the stress rapidly dissipates. But in order to recognize that, I first need to get it all down in front of me. I need to brain dump.

If you haven't ever done a brain dump, I'd recommend giving it a try. You might be surprised at what's lying around in there.
