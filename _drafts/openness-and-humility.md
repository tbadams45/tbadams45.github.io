title: Humility and Openness
---

Humility: a foundation to the Christian walk.
What is humility? Recognizing who we are before God.

How does openness play into humility? It's a recognition that our lives are already open before God. (Heb 4:12, etc.) It's a willingness to let others see the messy parts of our lives. 

Humility generally plays into openness. However, one can be open without being humble. It might simply be the way you're rigged, or the way you've been brought up.

Openness doesn't go all the way. We need vulnerability. This is where humility is a requirement. This is where I struggle.

Scriptures on humility, openness.

> This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, in him there is no darkness at all. If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his son, purifies us from all sin.
> If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sis, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.
> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense -- Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. *1 John 1:5-2:2*

> All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord. *Proverbs 16:2*

> The lamp of the Lord searches the spirit of a man; it searches out his inmost being. *Proverbs 20:27*

> All a man's ways seem right to him, but the Lord weighs the heart. *Proverbs 21:2

> He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. *Proverbs 28:13*

> For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account. *Hebrews 4:12-13* 

> Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. THe prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective. *James 5:16*

> You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
> Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. *Ephesians 4:20-25*

> Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: 'Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. WHat you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.
> 'I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear who who, after the killing of the body, has the power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; your are worth more than many sparrows.

> Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe. *Proverbs 29:25*
