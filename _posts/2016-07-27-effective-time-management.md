title: Effective Time Management (mainly at work)
description: Time management principles that I've learned, beyond the standard "make a schedule."
---

Ever since I had a minor nervous breakdown in sophomore year of high school because of everything I was trying to do, I've been trying to learn how to more effectively manage my time. Time is precious because it's an unreplenishable, finite resource (at least on this earth). It makes sense to try and use it to its fullest capacity.

Yet... I don't. A lot. It's easy not to. Effectively managing time has to do with knowing and disciplining yourself. Most of the time, using your time in the most effective way will involve doing something that you might not necessarily want to do right at this moment, either because it's hard or inconvient. I often prefer to have my fun beforehand and ignore what I really need to do until deadlines compell me otherwise. 

On top of that, and especially in the work that I've been doing this summer, it can be easy to get bogged down in things that take up a lot of time, without actually contributing much to my primary goal. I've found this to be the case a lot in the past couple of days.

So, without further ado, I'd like to present my working set of time management principles that I *intend* to use in my work and schoolwork. I'm categorizing their use to just these areas because those are the places where I've felt their lack the most keenly this summer. Many of them are applicable elsewhere, too. 

Many of these I've heard from other places before... There was a blog post that I read about a year about that had several of these ideas, but I can't recall who wrote it, unfortunately. My professor Bill Leonard at UMass also has been working to drill many of these in my and my class's heads.



# Time Management Principles To Operate By

- **Every day, make a list of what you'd like to accomplish that day.** It's possible you already have a list of things you should do that day from previous days. Review that list, sure, but make sure it actually matches up with the day that you're currently living, not yesterday's expectation of it.
- **Prioritize your list.** Key to this is answering the following questions: what do you *have* to get done today? What things on this list are moving forward your primary objectives?
- **Identify the most difficult item on your high priority list. Start with that.** It's my tendency to leave the hard stuff for the afternoon. That's a terrible idea. It leaves me with a sense of dread leading up to the work, and makes it easy to fill up the day with low priority tasks (or worse yet, complete avoidance of anything relevant to what I need to do.)
- **Work on one thing at a time.** Once you've decided on what you're going to do, *do it.* Don't dilly dally with unecessary planning.
- **If you've been stuck for ~5-10 minutes at the same point of a project, take a step back and evaluate your approach. If you're still stuck at the same point after another 10 minutes, stop.** There's no use to continue banging your head on the same thing and making no progress. It's not determination. It's foolishness. Take a short break, walk around a bit. Then switch to a different project, or an unrelated section of the same project.
- **Ask for help and get feedback.** I work best when I talk through what I'm doing with people. It provides clarity on what I'm actually struggling with, and it can spark insight that would take me several times as long to generate with my brain alone.
- **Take a lunch break.** This is... silly that I have to say this. But not taking a break in the middle of the day doesn't work for me. I burn out too easily.
- **Consider switching projects after a couple of hours.** This is the one I'm least certain about, since there's sometimes a benefit to working on the same thing for awhile. In the work that I'm doing this summer though (research/data visualization), I have plenty of projects to work on, and working on one has a tendency to enhance my thought process and understanding of another. Working for 6 hours straight on the same project can result in going down the rabbit hole.

All of these things make sense when I say them, but in the moment I often do the very oppposite of what I know would be best in the long run. That's the point where self-discipline comes in.
