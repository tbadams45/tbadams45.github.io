Welcome! I'm Tim Adams - a disciple of Jesus Christ. I currently work as a water resources engineering in Boston. I graduated from UMass Amherst with a B.S. in computer systems engineering, and then from MIT with a Masters of Engineering in environmental engineering science. 

This site is a collection of things I’m interested in, care about, and/or consider worth sharing. As I continue to add to what’s here, I intend to include posts that cover most areas of my life. We'll see where it goes.

If you'd like to contact me to respond to a post or for any other reason, you can reach me at tbadams45@gmail.com. I'd love to chat.
