{Ps 44:9-16}
And further concerning the sufferings of Christ the same prophet says: “Thou hast repelled and despised us; and hast cast away thine Anointed. Thou hast broken the covenant of my [250] servant; thou hast cast his holiness to the ground. Thou hast overthrown all his hedges; thou hast made his strongholds to tremble. [251] They that pass on the way have ravaged him; he is become a reproach to his neighbors. Thou hast exalted the right hand of his oppressors; thou hast made his enemies to rejoice over him. Thou hast turned away the help of his sword, and gavest him not a hand in the battle.” location 1770

Again He says in the Twelve Prophets, [253] “And they bound him and brought him as a present to the king.” For Pontius Pilate was governor of Judæa, and he had at that time resentful enmity against Herod the king of the Jews.

And yet more manifestly David says: “Hunting-dogs encompassed me: [257] the assembly of evil-doers came about me. They pierced my hands and my feet.” And again he says: “My heart became even as wax melting in the midst of my body; [258] and they put asunder [259] my bones.” And again he says: “Spare my soul from the sword and nail my flesh: for the assembly of evil-doers hath risen up against me.” [260] (Ps. cxix 120; xxii. 16.) In these words with manifest clearness he signifies that He should be crucified. location 1794

{Ps 68:18}
“He ascended up on high, he led captivity captive: he received, he gave gifts to men.” And by captivity he means the destruction of the rule of the apostate angels. [264] He declares also the place where He was to ascend into heaven from the earth. For the Lord, he says, from Sion ascended up on high. [265] For over against Jerusalem, on the mount which is called (the Mount) of Olives, after He was risen from the dead, He assembled His disciples, and expounded to them the things concerning the kingdom of heaven; and they saw that He ascended, and they saw how the heavens were opened and received Him. location 1824

89. That He would not send back the redeemed to the legislation of Moses—for the Law was fulfilled in Christ—but would have them live [273] in newness by the Word, through faith in the Son of God and love, Isaiah declared, saying: “Remember not the former things, nor bring to mind the things that were in the beginning. Behold I make new (things), which shall now spring up, and ye shall know (them). And I will make in the wilderness a way, and in the waterless place streams, to give drink to my chosen race, and to my people whom I have purchased to declare my virtues.” [274] Now a wilderness and a waterless place was at first the calling of the Gentiles: for the Word had not passed through them, [275] nor given them the Holy Spirit to drink; [276] who fashioned the new way of godliness and righteousness, and made copious streams to spring forth, disseminating over the earth the Holy Spirit; location 1877

Therefore by newness of the spirit is our calling, and not in the oldness of the letter; [277] even as Jeremiah prophesied: “Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will accomplish for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah the covenant: of the testament [278] which I covenanted with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in the covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the covenant of the testament that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws [279] into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach any more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them. For I will pardon and be merciful unto the sins of their iniquities, and their sins will I remember no more.”

{Isa 17:7-8}
 91. And that these promises the calling from among the Gentiles should inherit, to whom also the new testament was opened up, [280] Isaiah says thus: “These things saith the God of Israel: In that day a man shall trust [281] in his Maker, and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel: and they shall not trust in altars, nor in the work of their own hands, which their fingers have made.” For very plainly this was said of such as have forsaken idols and believed in God our Maker through the Holy One of Israel. And the Holy One of Israel is Christ: and He became visible to men, and to Him we look eagerly and behold Him; and we trust not in altars, nor in the location 1886

This also is that which was said by John the Baptist: “That God is able of these stones to raise up sons to Abraham.” For our hearts being withdrawn and taken away from the stony worship [284] by means of faith behold God, and become sons of Abraham, who was justified by faith. And therefore God says by Ezekiel the prophet: “And I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them: and I will withdraw and take away the stony heart from their flesh, and I will give them another heart of flesh: so that they shall walk in my precepts, and shall keep my ordinances and do them.” location 1909

Deuteronomy says that the Gentiles should be the head, and the unbelieving people the tail. And again he says: “Ye provoked me to jealousy with those that are no gods, and angered me with your idols: and I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, and with a foolish nation will I anger you.” (Cf. Rom. x. 19) Because they forsook the God who is, and worshipped and served the gods who are not; and they slew the prophets of God, and prophesied for Baal, who was the idol of the Canaanites. And the Son of God, who is, [287] they despised and condemned, but they chose Barabbas the robber who had been taken for murder: and the eternal King [288] they disavowed, and they acknowledged as their king the temporal Caesar.

God has summed up again for Himself in us the faith of Abraham, we ought not to turn back any more—I mean, to the first Legislation. For we have received the Lord of the Law, the Son of God; and by faith in Him we learn to love God with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves. Now the love of God is far from all sin, [289] and love to the neighbor works no ill to the neighbor. (Cf. Rom xiii. 10) Wherefore also we need not the Law as a tutor. Behold, with the Father we speak, and in His presence we stand, being children in malice, [290] and grown strong in all righteousness and soberness. For no longer shall the Law say, “Do not commit adultery,” to him who has no desire at all for another's wife; and “Thou shalt not kill,” to him who has put away from himself all anger and enmity; (and) “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's field or ox or ass,” to those who have no care at all for earthly things, but store up the heavenly fruits: nor “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,” to him who counts no man his enemy, but all men his neighbors, and therefore cannot stretch out his hand at all for vengeance. location 1934
