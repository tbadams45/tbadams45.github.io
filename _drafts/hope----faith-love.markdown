Colossians 1:3-5 says

> We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God's people -- the faith and love that spring from the **hope** stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel that has come to you.

So the faith and love that we have stem from the hope stored up for you in heaven.

What is that hope? The redemption of our bodies and the resurrection of the dead (see 1 Cor 15), possibly. But this takes us outside of Colossians. Is it answered in Colossians?

Hope is used three times in Colossians, all in chapter 1. First we see it in 1:3-5. Then we see it in 1:21-23.

> Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation -- if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the **hope** held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of what I, Paul, have become a servant. 

It's then used one more time, a few sentences down in 1:27. I'll include 1:24-27.

> Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regards to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. I have becomes its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness -- the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord's people. To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the **hope** of glory.

In 3-5 and 21-23, the hope we talk about is linked to the gospel.  


Interesting to note: glory (doxa) appears not just in 1:27 but also in 3:1-3.
