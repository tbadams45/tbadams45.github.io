I. The genera and heads of all special laws, which are called "the ten commandments," have been discussed with accuracy in the former treatise. We must now proceed to consider the particular commands as we read them in the subsequent passages of the holy scriptures; and we will begin with that which is turned into ridicule by people in general. (2) The ordinance of circumcision of the parts of generation is ridiculed, though it is an act which is practised to no slight degree among other nations also, and most especially by the Egyptians, who appear to me to be the most populous of all nations, and the most abounding in all kinds of wisdom. (3) In consequence of which it would be most fitting for men to discard childish ridicule, and to investigate the real causes of the ordinance with more prudence and dignity, considering the reasons why the custom has prevailed, and not being precipitate, so as without examination to condemn the folly of mighty nations, recollecting that it is not probable that so many myriads should be circumcised in every generation, mutilating the bodies of themselves and of their nearest relations, in a manner which is accompanied with severe pain, without adequate cause; but that there are many reasons which might encourage men to persevere and continue a custom which has been introduced by previous generations, and that these are from reasons of the greatest weight and importance. (4) First of all, that it is a preventive of a painful disease, and of an affliction difficult to be cured, which they call a carbuncle; [Fn. the Greek word is anthrax, which also signifies a coal. The Latin, from which our carbuncle is derived, carbunculus, a diminutive of carbo, which also means a coal.] because, I imagine, when it becomes inflamed it burns; from which fact it has derived that appellation. And this disease is very apt to be engendered among those who have not undergone the rite of circumcision. (5) Secondly, it secures the cleanliness of the whole body in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God; with which object the Egyptian priests, being extravagant in their case, shave the whole of their bodies; for some of these evils which ought to be got rid of are collected in and lodge under the hair and the prepuce. (6) Thirdly, there is the resemblance of the part that is circumcised to the heart; for both parts are prepared for the sake of generation; for the breath contained within the heart is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself is productive of living beings. Therefore, the men of old thought it right to make the evident and visible organ, by which the objects of the outward senses are generated, resemble that invisible and superior part, by means of which ideas are formed. (7) The fourth, and most important, is that which relates to the provision thus made [to enable them to be] prolific; for it is said that the seminal fluid proceeds in its path easily, neither being at all scattered, nor flowing on its passage into what may be called the bags of the prepuce. On which account those nations which practise circumcision are the most prolific and the most populous.

So that, transcending all visible essence by means of our reason, let us press forward to the honor of that everlasting and invisible Being who can be comprehended and appreciated by the mind alone;  location 19998

And, besides this distinct prohibition, there is another meaning which appears to me to be intended to be figuratively conveyed under these words, which is one of very great influence as contributing to the formation of the moral character, and which convicts in no slight degree those who are covetous of money and who seek to procure silver and gold from all quarters, and when they have acquired it treasure it up, as though it were some divine image, in their inmost shrines, looking upon it as the cause of all good things and of all happiness. And all the poor men that are possessed of that terrible disease, the love of money, but who, from not having any riches of their own which they can think worthy of their attention, fix their admiration on the wealth of their neighbors, and, for the purpose of offering adoration to it, come the first thing in the morning to the houses of those who have abundance, as if they were noble temples at which they were going to offer prayers, and to entreat blessings from their owners as if from the gods.  location 20012

"Those men, who have left their country, and their friends, and their relations for the sake of virtue and holiness, ought not to be left destitute of some other cities, and houses, and friends, but there ought to be places of refuge always ready for those who come over to religion; for the most effectual allurement and the most indissoluble bond of affectionate good will is the mutual honoring of the one God."  location 20125

Moreover, he also enjoins his people that, after they have given the proselytes an equal share in all their laws, and privileges, and immunities, on their forsaking the pride of their fathers and forefathers, they must not give a license to their jealous language and unbridled tongues, blaspheming those beings whom the other body looks upon as gods, lest the proselytes should be exasperated at such treatment, and in return utter impious language against the true and holy God; for from ignorance of the difference between them, and by reason of their having from their infancy learnt to look upon what was false as if it had been true, and having been bred up with it, they would be likely to err.  location 20129

For it is commanded that all men shall every year bring their first fruits to the temple, from twenty years old and upwards; and this contribution is called their ransom.  ...

There is also a third symbol contained in this sacred dress, which it is important not to pass over in silence. For the priests of other deities are accustomed to offer up prayers and sacrifices solely for their own relations, and friends, and fellow citizens. But the high priest of the Jews offers them up not only on behalf of the whole race of mankind, but also on behalf of the different parts of nature, of the earth, of water, of air, and of fire; and pours forth his prayers and thanksgivings for them all, looking upon the world (as indeed it really is) as his country, for which, therefore, he is accustomed to implore and propitiate its governor by supplications and prayers, beseeching him to give a portion of his own merciful and humane nature to the things which he has created.  location 20292

in short, therefore, we must look upon the use of wine to be a most unprofitable thing for all the purposes of life, inasmuch as by it the soul is weighed down, the outward senses are dimmed, and the body is enervated. For it does not leave any one of our faculties free and unembarrassed, but is a hindrance to every one of them, so as to impede its attaining that object to which it is by nature fitted.  ... On which account it probably is that it is commanded to the priest to offer up sacrifices without wine, in order to make a difference and distinction between sacred and profane things, and pure and impure things, and lawful and unlawful things.  location 20308

XIX. (cont) For it would be mere folly that some men should be excluded from the priesthood by reason of the scars which exist on their bodies from ancient wounds, which are the emblem of misfortune indeed, but not of wickedness; but that those persons who, not at all out of necessity but from their own deliberate choice, have made a market of their beauty, when at last they slowly repent, should at once after leaving their lovers become united to priests, and should come from brothels and be admitted into the sacred precincts.

XIX. (cont) For the scars and impressions of their old offences remain not the less in the souls of those who repent. On which account it is wisely and truly said in another passage, that "One may not bring the hire of a harlot into the temple" (Deuteronomy 23:18). And yet the money is not in itself liable to any reproach, except by reason of the woman who received it, and the action for which it was given to her. How then could one possibly admit those women to consort with priests whose very money is looked upon as profane and base, even though as to its material and stamp it may be good and lawful money?  location 20317

The regulations, therefore, are laid down with precision in this manner for the high priest, so that he is not allowed either to marry a widow, nor one who is left desolate after the death of the man to whom she has been espoused, nor one who has been divorced from a husband who is still alive, in order that the sacred seed may be sown for the first time in a field which is hitherto untrodden and pure, and that his offspring may have no admixture of the blood of any other house.  location 20325

But the woman who has had experience of another husband is very naturally less inclined to obedience and to instruction, inasmuch as she has not a soul perfectly pure, like thoroughly smooth wax, so as to receive distinctly the doctrines which are to be impressed upon it, but one which is to a certain degree rough from the impressions which have been already stamped upon it, which are difficult to be effaced, and so remain,  location 20329

XXI. (108) But besides this, injunctions are given to the particular and inferior priests concerning their marriages, which are the very same in most points, which are given to those who have the supreme priesthood. But they are permitted with impunity to marry not only maidens but widows also; not, indeed, all widows, but those whose husbands are dead. For the Law thinks it fitting to remove all quarrels and disputes from the life of the priests. And if they had husbands living there very likely might be disputes from the jealousy which is caused by the love of men for women. But when the first husband is dead, then with him the hostility which could be felt towards the second husband dies also. (109) And even on other accounts he might have thought that the high priest ought to be of superior purity and holiness, as in other matters so also in the connection of marriage, and on this account it may have been that God only allowed the high priest to marry a virgin. But to the priests of the second rank he remitted something of the rigor of his regulations concerning the connection with women, permitting them to marry women who have made trials of other husbands    location 20343

but there is no one besides the high priest himself, who is permitted to perform his duties instead of him; for which reason, he must always be kept free from all defilement, never touching any dead body, in order that, being always ready to offer up prayers and sacrifices on behalf of the whole world at suitable seasons, he may continue to fulfil the duties of his office without hindrance. And otherwise too, besides this consideration, the man who has been assigned to God, and who has become the leader of his sacred band of worshippers, ought to be disconnected with, and alienated from, all things of creation, not being so much the slave of the love of either parents, or children, or brothers, as either to omit or to delay any one of those holy actions, which it is by all means better should be done at once;  location 20358

In like manner, no one must give this sacred honor to a hired hand, as his wages, or as a recompense for his service; for sometimes he who receives it being unholy will employ it for illegitimate purposes, making the honors due to purity of birth common, and profaning all the sacred ceremonies and observances relating to the temple; on which account the Law altogether forbids any foreigner to partake in any degree of the holy things, even if he be a man of the noblest birth among the natives of the land, and irreproachable as respects both men and women, ... as if it were reasonable that the priests should be worn out with labors and toils, and nightly and daily cares, but that the rewards for such pains should be common and open to those who do nothing.  location 20398

XXV. (cont) But, he proceeds, let the priest who is his master give to the slave who is born in his house, and to him who has been purchased with money, a share of meat and drink from the first fruits. In the first place, because the master is the only source of supply to the servant, and the inheritance of the master are the sacred offices of humanity, by which the slave must necessarily be supported. In the second place, because it is by all means necessary that they should not do what is to be done unwillingly; and servants, even though we may not like it, since they are always about us and living with us, preparing meat, and drink, and delicacies for their masters beforehand, and standing at their tables, and carrying away the fragments that are left, even though they may not take any openly, will at all events secretly appropriate some of the victuals, being compelled by necessity to steal, so that instead of one injury (if indeed it is an injury to their masters that they should be supported at their expense), they are compelled to add a second to it, namely, theft; in order that, like thieves, they may enjoy what has been consecrated by their masters who live irreproachably themselves; which is the most unreasonable thing possible.  location 20399

XXV. (cont) Thirdly, one ought to take this also into consideration, that share of the first fruits will not be neglected merely because they are distributed to the servants, through their fear of their masters; for this is sufficient to stop their mouths, preventing the arrogance of such persons from showing itself.  location 20408

If, says he, the daughter of a priest, having married a man who is not a priest, becomes a widow by the death of her husband, or if she be left childless while he is still alive, let her return again to her father's house, to receive her share of the first fruits which she enjoyed when she was a virgin; (Leviticus 22:12), for in some degree and in effect she is now also a virgin, since she has neither husband nor children, and has no other refuge but her father; but if she has sons or daughters, then the mother must of necessity be classed with the children; and the sons and daughters, being ranked as of the family of their father, draw their mother also with them into his house.  location 20411

XXXIII. (cont) Also, passing over the innumerable troops of land animals, whose very numbers it is not easy to ascertain, he selected these especially as the best-the oxen, and sheep, and goats; for these are the most gentle and the most manageable of all animals. At all events, great herds of oxen, and numerous flocks of goats and sheep, are easily driven by any one, not merely by any man, but by any little child, when they go forth to pasture,  ... And of this gentleness, there are many other proofs, and the most evident are these: that they all feed on herbage, and that no one of them is carnivorous, and that they have neither crooked talons, nor any projecting tusks or teeth whatever;  ... besides these facts, they are of all animals the most useful to man. Rams are the most useful for the necessary covering of the body; oxen, for plowing the ground and preparing the arable land for seed, and for the growth of the crops that shall hereafter come to be threshed out, in order that men may partake of and enjoy food; and the hair and fleeces of goats, where one is woven, or the other sewn together, make movable tents for travelers, and especially for men engaged in military expeditions,  location 20541

So great is the caution used with respect not only to those who offer the sacrifices, but also to the victims which are offered, that the most eminent of the priests are carefully selected to examine whether they have any blemishes or not, and scrutinize them from head to foot, inspecting not only those parts which are easily visible, but all those which are more out of sight, such as the belly and the thighs, lest any slight imperfection should escape notice.

And for the deliverance from evils it has allotted the sacrifice called a sin-offering, so that these are very appropriately their sacrifices for these causes; the whole burnt-offering being sacrificed for God himself alone, who must be honored for his own sake, and not for that of any other being or thing; and the others for our sake; the thank-offering for our preservation, for the safety and amelioration of human affairs; and the sin-offering for the cure of those offences which the soul has committed.  location 20598

And the words employed are visible symbols of what is invisible and uncertain. Now the victim which is to be sacrificed as a whole burnt offering must be a male, because a male is both more akin to domination than a female and more nearly related to the efficient cause; for the female is imperfect, subject, seen more as the passive than as the active partner. And since the elements of which our soul consists are two in number, the rational and the irrational part, the rational part belongs to the male sex, being the inheritance of intellect and reason; but the irrational part belongs to the sex of woman, which is the lot also of the outward senses. And the mind is in every respect superior to the outward sense, as the man is to the woman; who, when he is without blemish and purified with the proper purifications, namely, the perfect virtues, is himself the most holy sacrifice, being wholly and in all respects pleasing to God.  location 20609

Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.40

{Lev 7:11; 1 Thess 5:23}

XLI. To this species of sacrifice for preservation that other sacrifice also belongs, which is called the sacrifice of praise, and which rests on the following principle (Leviticus 19:1). The man who has never fallen into any unexpected disaster whatever, neither as to his body nor as to his external circumstances, but who has passed a tranquil and peaceful life, living in happiness and prosperity, being free from all calamity and all mishap, steering through the long voyage of life in calmness and serenity of circumstances, good fortune always blowing upon the stern of his vessel, is, of necessity, bound to requite God, who has been the pilot of his voyage, who has bestowed upon him untroubled salvation and unalloyed benefits, and, in short, all sorts of blessings unmingled with any evil, with hymns, and songs, an prayers, and also with sacrifices, and all other imaginable tokens of gratitude in a holy manner; all which things taken together have received the one comprehensive name of praise.  location 20712

Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.42

{Lev 4:1-35}
XLII. (cont) The sins therefore of the high priest, and of the whole nation, are atoned for by animals of equal value, for the priest is commanded to offer up a calf for each. The sins of the ruler are atoned for by an inferior animal, but still a male, for a kid is the appointed victim. The sins of the private individual by a victim of an inferior species, for it is a female, not a male, a she-goat, that is sacrificed; (229) for it was fitting that a ruler should be ranked above a private individual, even in his performance of sacred ceremonies also: but the nation is superior to the ruler, since the whole must, at all times, be superior to the part. But the high priest is accounted worthy of the same honour as the whole nation, in respect of purification and of entreating a forgiveness of his sins from the merciful power of God. And he receives an equality of honour, not so much as it appears for his own sake, as because he is a servant of the nation, offering up a common thank-offering for them all in his most sacred prayers and most holy sacrifices.   location 20727
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.42

{Lev 4:1-12; 1 Pet 1:15-16; Heb 7:26; Heb 9:7}
XLII. (cont) And the commandment given respecting these matters is one of great dignity and admirable solemnity. "If," says the Law, "the high priest have sinned unintentionally," and then it adds, "so that the people has sinned too," all but affirming in express words that the true high priest, not the one incorrectly called so, has no participation in sin; and if ever he stumble, this will happen to him, not for his own sake, but for the common errors of the nation,  location 20734

{Lev 5:15-16; Heb 9:7}
XLIII. (234) But since, of offenses some are committed against men, and some against holy and sacred things; he has hitherto been speaking with reference to those which are unintentionally committed against men; but for the purification of such as have been committed against sacred things he commands a ram to be offered up, after the offender has first paid the value of the thing to which the offence related, adding one fifth to the exact value.
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.43

{Lev 7:1-5; Lev 6:9-11}
XLIII. (cont) And we must take notice that the parts of the victim slain as a sin-offering which are placed upon the altar, are the same as those which are taken from the sacrifice for preservation, namely the lobe of the liver, and the fat, and the kidneys; for in a manner we may speak also of the man who repents as being preserved, since he is cured of a disease of the soul, which is worse than the diseases of the body; (240) but the other parts of the animal are assigned to be eaten in a different manner; and the difference consists in three things; in the place, and time, and in those who receive it. (Leviticus 6:9). ... Now the place is the temple; the time is one day instead of two; and the persons who partake of it are the priests, and the male servants of the priests, but not the men who offer the sacrifice.  location 20770
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.43

{Lev 6:9; Lev 7:15}
XLIV. And the Law orders the priests to feast on what is offered in the sacrifice for many reasons; first of all, that by this command it may do honor to him who has offered the sacrifice, for the dignity of those who eat of the feast is an honor to those who furnish it; secondly, that they may believe the more firmly that those men who feel repentance for their sins do really have God propitious to them, for he would never have invited his servants and ministers to a participation in such a banquet, if his forgiveness of those who provided it had not been complete; and thirdly, because it is not lawful for any one of the priests to bear a part in the sacred ceremonies who is not perfect, for they are rejected for the slightest blemish.  ... And it is for this reason that the victim sacrificed as a sin-offering is consumed in one day, because men ought to delay to sin, being always slow and reluctant to approach it, but to exert all possible haste and promptness in doing well.  location 20782
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.44

{Num 6:2-21}
XLV. Having given these commandments about every description of sacrifice in its turn, namely, about the burnt offering, and the sacrifice for preservation, and the sin-offering, he adds another kind of offering common to all the three, in order to show that they are friendly and connected with one another; and this combination of them all is called the great vow [i.e. Nazarite]; and why it received this appellation we must now proceed to say.  location 20792
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.45

{Num 6:2-21; Rom 12:1}
XLV. (cont) and when they have no longer any materials left in which they can display their piety, they then consecrate and offer up themselves, displaying an unspeakable holiness, and a most superabundant excess of a God-loving disposition, on which account such a dedication is fitly called the great vow; for every man is his own greatest and most valuable possession, and this even he now gives up and abandons.  location 20797
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.45

{Num 6:2-21; Lev 10:9}
XLV. (cont) And when a man has vowed this vow the Law gives him the following command; first of all, to touch no unmixed wine, nor any wine that is made of the grape, nor to drink any other strong drink whatever, to the destruction of his reason, considering that during this period his reason also is dedicated to God; for all which could tend to drunkenness is forbidden to those of the priests who are employed in the sacred ministrations, they being commanded to quench their thirst with water; in the second place they are commanded not to show their heads, giving thus a visible sign to all who see them that they are not debasing the pure coinage of their vow; thirdly, they are commanded to keep their body pure and undefiled, so as not even to approach their parents if they are dead, nor their brothers;  location 20800
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.45

{Num 6:13-21; Rom 3:23; Lev 7:11 LXX}
XLVI. But when the appointed time for their being released (Numbers 6:14), from this vow has arrived, the Law then commands the man who has dedicated himself to bring three animals to procure his release from his vow, a male lamb, and a female lamb, and a ram; the one for a burnt offering, the second for a sin-offering, and the ram as a sacrifice for preservation; for in some sense the man who has made such a vow resembles all these things.  ... He resembles the sacrifice of the entire burnt offering, because he is dedicating to his preserver not only a portion of the first fruits of other things, but also of his own self. And he resembles the sin-offering, inasmuch as he is a man; for there is no one born, however perfect he may be, who can wholly avoid the commission of sin. He resembles also the offering for preservation, inasmuch as he has recorded that God the Savior is the cause of his preservation, and does not ascribe it to any physician or to any power of his;  location 20810

{Lev 7:11 LXX}
XLVI. (cont) Medicine does not benefit all persons, nor does it always benefit the same persons; but there are times even when it does them great injury, since its power depends on different things, both on the thing itself and also on those persons who use it.  location 20815

{Num 6:18; Lev 6:12-13}
XLVI. (cont) But since the man has begun to offer himself as his first fruits, and since it is not lawful for the sacred altar to be polluted with human blood, but yet it was by all means necessary that a portion should be consecrated, he has taken care to take a portion, which, being taken, should cause neither pain nor defilement; for he has cut off (Numbers 6:18), the hair of the head, the superfluities of the natural body, as if they were the superfluous branches of a tree, and he has committed them to the fire on which the meat of the sacrifice offered for preservation will be suitably prepared, (Leviticus 6:13) in order that some portion of the man who has made the vow, which it is not lawful to place upon the altar, may still at all events be combined with the sacrifice, burning the fuel of the sacred flame.  location 20821
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.46

{Lev 6:20-21; Heb 7:27}
XLVII. (255) These sacred fires are common to all the rest of the people. But it was fitting that the priests also should offer up something on the altar as first fruits, not thinking that the services and sacred ministrations to which they have been appointed have secured them an exemption from such duties. And the first fruits suitable for the priests to offer do not come from anything containing blood, but from the purest portion of human food; for the fine wheat flour is their continual offering; a tenth part of a sacred measure every day; one half of which is offered up in the morning, and one half in the evening, having been soaked in oil, so that no portion of it can be left for food;  location 20827

(257) The law chooses that a person who brings a sacrifice shall be pure, both in body and soul; --pure in soul from all passions, and diseases, and vices, which can be displayed either in word or deed; and pure in body from all such things as a body is usually defiled by. (258) ... What, then, is the mode of purifying the soul?

{Num 19:1-10; Mt 3:11}
XLIX. (262) We must consider what great prudence and philosophical wisdom is displayed in this law; for nearly all other persons are besprinkled with pure water, generally in the sea, some in rivers, and others again in vessels of water which they draw from fountains. But Moses, having previously prepared ashes which had been left from the sacred fire (and in what manner shall be explained hereafter), appointed that it should be right to take some of them and to put them in a vessel, and then to pour water upon them, and then, dipping some branches of hyssop in the mixture of ashes and water, to sprinkle it over those who were to be purified. (263) And the cause of this proceeding may very probably be said to be this:--The lawgiver's intention is that those who approach the service of the living God should first of all know themselves and their own essence. For how can the man who does not know himself ever comprehend the supreme and all-excelling power of God? (264) Therefore, our bodily essence is earth and water, of which he reminds us by this purification, conceiving that this result--namely, to know one's self, and to know also of what one is composed, of what utterly valueless substances mere ashes and water are--is of itself the most beneficial purification. (265) For when a man is aware of this he will at once reject all vain and treacherous conceit, and, discarding haughtiness and pride, he will seek to become pleasing to God
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.49

{Num 19:1-10}
L. (267) But now it is necessary to fulfil our promise and to explain the peculiar propriety involved in this use of ashes. For they are not merely the ashes of wood which has been consumed by fire, but also of an animal particularly suited for this kind of purification. For the Law orders that a red heifer, which has never been brought under the yoke, shall be sacrificed outside of the city, and that the high priest, taking some of the blood, shall seven times sprinkle with it all the things in front of the temple, and then shall burn the whole animal, with its hide and flesh, and with the belly full of all the entrails. And when the flame begins to pour down, then it commands that these three things shall be thrown into the middle of it, a stick of cedar, a stick of hyssop, and a bunch of saffron; and then, when the fire is wholly extinguished, it commands that some man who is clean shall collect the ashes, and shall again place them outside of the city in some open place. (269) And what figurative meanings he conceals under these orders as symbols, we have accurately explained in another treatise,

{Ex 25:8-40; Ex 27:1-19; Prov 15:8; Prov 21:3; Prov 21:27}
LI. (273) And that this statement is true, and not mine but that of nature, is testified to a certain degree by the evident nature of the thing itself, which affords a manifest proof which none can deny who do not cleave to credulity out of a contentious disposition. It is testified also by the Law which commands two altars to be prepared, differing both as to the materials of which they are made, as to the places in which they are erected, and as to the purposes to which they are applied; (274) for one is made of stones, carefully selected so to fit one another, and unhewn, and it is erected in the open air, near the steps of the temple, and it is for the purpose of sacrificing victims which contain blood in them. And the other is made of gold, and is erected in the inner part of the temple, within the first veil, and may not be seen by any other human being except those of the priests who keep themselves pure, and it is for the purpose of offering incense upon; (275) from which it is plain that God looks upon even the smallest offering of frankincense by a holy man as more valuable than ten thousand beasts which may be sacrificed by one who is not thoroughly virtuous.

(cont)  This injunction also is very admirably and properly set down in the sacred tablets of the Law, that the wages of a harlot are not to be received into the temple, and inasmuch as she has earned them by selling her beauty, having chosen a most infamous life for the sake of shameful gain; (281) but if the gifts which proceed from a woman who has lived as a concubine are unholy, how can those be different which proceed from a soul which is defiled in the same manner, which has voluntarily abandoned itself to shame and to the lowest infamy, to drunkenness and gluttony, and covetousness and ambition, and love of pleasure, and to innumerable other kinds of passions, and diseases, and wickednesses?

And let no one of you say that this very flesh shall not be judged, nor rise again. Consider ye in what state ye were saved, in what ye received sight, if not while ye were in this flesh.

Introduction to the ECSB
*[A certain presbyter, of whom see Apost. Constitutions, vii. 46, where he is said to have been ordained by St. John, the Evangelist. ref.]
[Papias, who is now mentioned by us, affirms that he received the sayings of the apostles from those who accompanied them, and he moreover asserts that he heard in person Aristion and the presbyter John*. Accordingly he mentions them frequently by name, and in his writings gives their traditions. Our notice of these circumstances may not be without its use. It may also be worthwhile to add to the statements of Papias already given, other passages of his in which he relates some miraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge of them from tradition.

Acts.20:8,9
The residence of the Apostle Philip with his daughters in Hierapolis has been mentioned above. We must now point out how Papias, who lived at the same time, relates that he had received a wonderful narrative from the daughters of Philip. For he relates that a dead man was raised to life in his day.

He also mentions another miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the Lord.
The same person, moreover, has set down other things as coming to him from unwritten tradition, amongst these some strange parables and instructions of the Saviour, and some other things of a more fabulous nature.1758 Amongst these he says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal reign of Christ will be established on this earth. He moreover hands down, in his own writing, other narratives given by the previously mentioned Aristion of the Lord's sayings, and the traditions of
the presbyter John. For information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves.

but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being a Mter of primary
importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]: And the presbyter said this. Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took special care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark]

but with regard to Mthew he has made the following statements]: Mthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.

And he also gives another story of a woman who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is to be found in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.]

He said to me, "That was sound doctrine which you heard; for that is really the case. For he who has received remission of his sins ought not to sin any more, but to live in purity. Since, however, you inquire diligently into all things, I will point this also out to you, not as giving occasion for error to those who are to believe, or have lately believed, in the Lord. For those who have now believed, and those who are to believe, have not repentance for their sins; but they have remission of their previous sins. For to those who have been called before these days, the Lord has set repentance. For the Lord, knowing the heart, and foreknowing all things, knew the weakness of men and the manifold wiles of the devil, that he would inflict some evil on the servants of God, and would act wickedly towards them. The Lord, therefore, being merciful, has had mercy on the work of His hand, and has set repentance for them; and He has entrusted to me power over this repentance. And therefore I say to you, that if any one is tempted by the devil, and sins after that great and holy calling in which the Lord has called His people to everlasting life, he has opportunity to repent but once.    location 21036

who indulges in luxury, and is deceived for one day, and who does what he wishes, is clothed with much foolishness, and does not understand the act which he does until the morrow; for he forgets what he did the day before.

All these acts of luxury are hurtful to the servants of God. On account of these deceits, therefore, do they suffer, who are punished and tortured. And there are also acts of luxury which save men; for many who do good indulge in luxury, being carried away by their own pleasure: this luxury, however, is beneficial to the servants of God, and gains life for such a man; but the injurious acts of luxury before enumerated bring tortures and punishment upon them; and if they continue in them and do not repent, they bring death upon themselves."    location 21534

"He that does not know God," he answered, "and practices evil, receives a certain chastisement for his wickedness; but he that has known God, ought not any longer to do evil, but to do good. If, accordingly, when he ought to do good, he does evil, does not he appear to do greater evil than he who does not know God? For this reason, they who have not known God and do evil are condemned to death; but they who have known God, and have seen His mighty works, and still continue in evil, shall be chastised doubly, and shall die for ever. In this way, then, will the Church of God be purified.    location 21955

And the bishops never failed to protect, by their service, the widows, and those who were in want, and always maintained a holy conversation.

And why their fruits are of various kinds, and some of them superior, listen. All," he continued, "who were brought before the authorities and were examined, and did not deny, but suffered cheerfully-these are held in greater honour with God, and of these the fruit is superior; but all who were cowards, and in doubt, and who reasoned in their hearts whether they would deny or confess, and yet suffered, of these the fruit is less, because that suggestion came into their hearts; for that suggestion-that a servant should deny his Lord-is evil.

Such accordingly, without doubt, dwell in the kingdom of God, because they defiled in nothing the commandments of God; but they remained like children all the days of their life in the same mind. All of you, then, who shall remain stedfast, and be as children, without doing evil, will be more honoured than all who have been previously mentioned; for all infants are honourable before God, and are the first persons with Him.

{Acts 17:18; Rom 2:6-8}
But lest some suppose, from what has been said by us, that we say that whatever happens, happens by a fatal necessity, because it is foretold as known beforehand, this too we explain. We have learned from the prophets, and we hold it to be true, that punishments, and chastisements, and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of each man's actions. Since if it be not so, but all things happen by fate, neither is anything at all in our own power.    location 5835

For if it be fated that this man, e.g., be good, and this other evil, neither is the former meritorious nor the latter to be blamed. And again, unless the human race have the power of avoiding evil and choosing good by free choice, they are not accountable for their actions, of whatever kind they be. But that it is by free choice they both walk uprightly and stumble, we thus demonstrate. We see the same man making a transition to opposite things. Now, if it had been fated that he were to be either good or bad, he could never have been capable of both the opposites,    location 5838
Justin Martyr, First Apology, Ch.43

{Rom 2:6-11; Rev 22:11-12}
But this we assert is inevitable fate, that they who choose the good have worthy rewards, and they who choose the opposite have their merited awards. For not like other things, as trees and quadrupeds, which cannot act by choice, did God make man: for neither would he be worthy of reward or praise did he not of himself choose the good, but were created for this end; nor, if he were evil, would he be worthy of punishment, not being evil of himself, but being able to be nothing else than what he was made.    location 5845

And if ye be willing and obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye do not obey Me, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."    location 5852

So that what we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being His decree that the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to the merit of the actions done, always urging the human race to effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for men.    location 5862

And He does not bid them part with their property, but, applying the just and removing the unjust judgment, He subjoins, "To-day salvation has come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham." He so praises the use of property as to enjoin, along with this addition, the giving a share of it, to give drink to the thirsty, bread to the hungry,    location 39973

For it was difficult for the soul not to be seduced and ruined by the luxuries and flowery enchantments that beset remarkable wealth; but it was not impossible, even surrounded with it, for one to lay hold of salvation, provided he withdrew himself from material wealth,-to that which is grasped by the mind and taught by God, and learned to use things indifferent rightly and properly, and so as to strive after eternal life.    location 40046

But the Lord replies, "Because what is impossible with men is possible with God." This again is full of great wisdom. For a man by himself working and toiling at freedom from passion achieves nothing. But if he plainly shows himself very desirous and earnest about this, he attains it by the addition of the power of God. For God conspires with willing souls.

"Whoso hateth not father, and mother, and children, and his own life besides, cannot be My disciple." For the God of peace, who also exhorts to love enemies, does not introduce hatred and dissolution from those that are dearest. But if we are to love our enemies, it is in accordance with right reason that, ascending from them, we should love also those nearest in kindred. Or if we are to hate our blood-relations, deduction teaches us that much more are we to spurn from us our enemies. So that the reasonings would be shown to destroy one another. But they do not destroy each other, nor are they near doing so.

So that even in the case of one who has done the greatest good deeds in his life, but at the end has run headlong into wickedness, all his former pains are profitless to him, since at the catastrophe of the drama he has given up his part; while it is possible for the man who formerly led a bad and dissolute life, on afterwards repenting, to overcome in the time after repentance the evil conduct of a long time.    location 40257

He fears not the fire. But if one chooses to continue and to sin perpetually in pleasures, and values indulgence here above eternal life, and turns away from the Savior, who gives forgiveness; let him no more blame either God, or riches, or his having fallen, but his own soul, which voluntarily perishes.    location 40314

Since then the soul consists of three divisions; the intellect, which is called the reasoning faculty, is the inner man, which is the ruler of this [physical] man that is seen.

{Jer 4:30}
"For though thou clothe thyself in scarlet, and deck thyself with ornaments of gold, and anoint thine eyes with stibium, in vain is thy beauty," says the Word by Jeremiah. Is it not monstrous, that while horses, birds, and the rest of the animals, spring and bound from the grass and meadows, rejoicing in ornament that is their own, in mane, and natural color, and varied plumage; woman, as if inferior to the brute creation, should think herself so unlovely as to need foreign, and bought, and painted beauty?    location 29023

Likewise also, when Samuel the prophet was sent to anoint one of the sons of Jesse for king, and on seeing the eldest of his sons to be fair and tall, produced the anointing oil, being delighted with him, the Lord said to him, "Look not to his appearance, nor the height of his stature: for I have rejected him. For man looketh on the eyes, but the Lord into the heart." And he anointed not him that was comely in person, but him that was comely in soul. If, then, the Lord counts the natural beauty of the body inferior to that of the soul, what thinks He of spurious beauty, rejecting utterly as He does all falsehood?

Prophecy has called him the "Ancient of days; and the hair of His head was as pure wool," says the prophet. "And none other," says the Lord, "can make the hair white or black."

Nor did the sleepless guard of humanity observe their licentiousness in silence; but dissuading us from the imitation of them, and training us up to His own temperance, and falling on some sinners, lest lust being unavenged, should break loose from all the restraints of fear, ordered Sodom to be burned, pouring forth a little of the sagacious fire on licentiousness; lest lust, through want of punishment, should throw wide the gates to those that were rushing into voluptuousness.    location 29348

But let desire for the admiration of their husbands alone be proposed as their aim. I would not have them to devote themselves to personal display, but to attract their husbands by chaste love for them--a powerful and legitimate charm.

For it is never suitable for women whose lives are framed according to God, to appear arrayed in things bought from the market, but in their own home-made work.

instead of that, we find that even inquiry in regard to our case is forbidden. For the younger Pliny, when he was ruler of a province, having condemned some Christians to death, and driven some from their steadfastness, being still annoyed by their great numbers, at last sought the advice of Trajan, the reigning emperor, as to what he was to do with the rest, explaining to his master that, except an obstinate disinclination to offer sacrifices, he found in the religious services nothing but meetings at early morning for singing hymns to Christ and God, and sealing home their way of life by a united pledge to be faithful to their religion, forbidding murder, adultery, dishonesty, and other crimes. Upon this Trajan wrote back that Christians were by no means to be sought after; but if they were brought before him, they should be punished.

Nobody thinks it needful to consider whether Gaius is not good and Lucius wise, on this very account that he is a Christian; or a Christian, for the reason that he is wise and good.   location 42282

For this is the covenant of the testament that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws [279] into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach any more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest of them.

Deuteronomy says that the Gentiles should be the head, and the unbelieving people the tail. And again he says: "Ye provoked me to jealousy with those that are no gods, and angered me with your idols: and I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, and with a foolish nation will I anger you." (Cf. Rom. x. 19) Because they forsook the God who is, and worshipped and served the gods who are not; and they slew the prophets of God, and prophesied for Baal, who was the idol of the Canaanites. And the Son of God, who is, [287] they despised and condemned, but they chose Barabbas the robber who had been taken for murder: and the eternal King [288] they disavowed, and they acknowledged as their king the temporal Caesar. (So) it pleased God to grant their inheritance to the foolish Gentiles, location 1926

God has summed up again for Himself in us the faith of Abraham, we ought not to turn back any more--I mean, to the first Legislation. For we have received the Lord of the Law, the Son of God; and by faith in Him we learn to love God with all our heart, and our neighbor as ourselves. Now the love of God is far from all sin, [289] and love to the neighbor works no ill to the neighbor. (Cf. Rom xiii. 10) Wherefore also we need not the Law as a tutor. Behold, with the Father we speak, and in His presence we stand, being children in malice, [290] and grown strong in all righteousness and soberness. For no longer shall the Law say, "Do not commit adultery," to him who has no desire at all for another's wife; and "Thou shalt not kill," to him who has put away from himself all anger and enmity; (and) "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's field or ox or ass," to those who have no care at all for earthly things, but store up the heavenly fruits: nor "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," to him who counts no man his enemy, but all men his neighbors, and therefore cannot stretch out his hand at all for vengeance. location 1934

{1 Cor 8:1; Mt 15:11}
8:1: Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.
What then is it of which he was then accusing the Corinthians? A heavy charge and the cause of many evils. Well, what is it? Many among them, having learnt that (Matthew 15:11.) "not the things which enter in defile the man, but the things which proceed out," and that idols of wood and stone, and demons, have no power to hurt or help, had made an immoderate use of their perfect knowledge of this to the harm both of others and of themselves. They had both gone in where idols were and had partaken of the tables there, and were producing thereby great and ruinous evil. For, on the one hand, those who still retained the fear of idols and knew not how to contemn them, took part in those meals, because they saw the more perfect sort doing this; and hence they got the great injury: since they did not touch what was set before them with the same mind as the others, but as things offered in sacrifice to idols; and the thing was becoming a way to idolatry. On the other hand, these very persons who pretended to be more perfect were injured in no common way, partaking in the tables of demons.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 8:1}
Now this blessed man being about to correct it, did not immediately begin to speak vehemently; for that which was done came more of folly than of wickedness: wherefore in the first instance there was need rather of exhortation than of severe rebuke and wrath. ...
"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge." Leaving alone the weak, which he always does, he discourses with the strong first. ... And first he makes void their conceit by declaring that this very thing which they considered as peculiar to themselves, the having perfect knowledge, was common to all. Thus, "we know," says he, "that we all have knowledge." ... For what was done was of knowledge, and perfect knowledge. Nor was it safe to overthrow it, and yet in no other way was it possible to cast out the conceit which had resulted from it. What then does he? First, by signifying that it was common, he curbs that swelling pride of theirs. For they who possess something great and excellent are more elated, when they alone have it; but if it be made out that they possess it in common with others, they no longer have so much of this feeling. First then he makes it common property, because they considered it to belong to themselves alone.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 8:1-2}
[2.] The next has greater force. What then is this? In that he shows that not even this thing itself was in all points complete, but imperfect, and extremely so. And not only imperfect, but also injurious, unless there were another thing joined together with it. For having said that" we have knowledge," he added, "Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies:" so that when it is without love, it lifts men up to absolute arrogance.
... It seems then that knowledge is not productive of love, but on the contrary debars from it him that is not on his guard, puffing him up and elating him. For arrogance is wont to cause divisions: but love both draws together and leads to knowledge.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 8:1-3}
Ver. 3: "But if any man loves God, the same is known of Him."
So that "I forbid not this," says he, "namely, your having perfect knowledge; but your having it with love, that I enjoin; else is it no gain, but rather loss."
Do you see how he already sounds the first note of his discourse concerning love? For since all these evils were springing from the following root, i.e.., not from perfect knowledge, but from their not greatly loving nor sparing their neighbors; ... For although you may know something more than your neighbor, if you love him you will not set yourself up but lead him also to the same." Wherefore also having said, "Knowledge puffs up," he added, "but love edifies." He did not say, "Behaves itself modestly," but what is much more, and more gainful. For their knowledge was not only puffing them up but also distracting them. On this account he opposes the one to the other.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 8:2}
[3.] And then he adds a third consideration, which was of force to set them down. What then is this? that although charity be joined with it, yet not even in that case is this our knowledge perfect.

Verse 2. "But if any man think that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know."
This is a mortal blow. ... Now if we possess as yet exact knowledge of nothing, how is it that some have rushed on to such a pitch of frenzy as to say that they know God with all exactness? ... And mark how he pulls down their swelling pride: for he said not, "of the matters before us you have not the proper knowledge," but, "about everything." And he did not say, "you," but, "no one whatever," be it Peter, be it Paul, be it anyone else. For by this he both soothed them and carefully kept them under.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 8:3}
Verse 3. "But if any man loves God, the same is known of Him."
He does not say, "knows Him," but, "is known of Him." For we have not known Him, but He has known us. And therefore did Christ say, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you." And Paul elsewhere, "Then shall I know fully, even as also I have been known." Observe now, I pray, by what means he brings down their high-mindedness. ... In addition to this, that they have not even this from themselves, but by gift from God. For he said not, "has known God," but, "is known of Him." Again, that this very thing comes of love which they have not as they ought. For, "if any man," says he, "love God, the same is known of Him."
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 8:4}
[4.] Verse 4. "Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one."
Look what a strait he has fallen into! For indeed his mind is to prove both; that one ought to abstain from this kind of banquet, and that it has no power to hurt those who partake of it: things which were not greatly in agreement with each other. For when they were told that they had no harm, in them, they would naturally run to them as indifferent things. But when forbidden to touch them, they would suspect, on the contrary, that their having power to do hurt occasioned the prohibition. Wherefore, you see, he puts down their opinion about idols, and then states as a first reason for their abstaining the stumbling blocks which they place in the way of their brethren; in these words: "Now concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world." Again he makes it common property and does not allow this to be theirs alone, but extends the knowledge all over the world. For "not among you alone," says he, "but everywhere on earth this doctrine prevails." What then is it? "That no idol is anything in the world; that there is no God but one." What then? are there no idols? no statues? Indeed there are; but they have no power: neither are they gods, but stones and demons.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 8:5}
[5.] Verse 5. "For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as there are gods many and lords many; yet to us there is one God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and we to Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we through Him."
Since he had said, that "an idol is nothing" and that "there is no other God;" and yet there were idols and there were those that were called gods; that he might not seem to be contradicting plain facts, he goes on to say, "For though there be that are called gods, as indeed there are;" not absolutely, "there are;" but, "called," not in reality having this but in name: "be it in heaven or on earth: - in heaven," meaning the sun and the moon and the remainder of the choir of stars; for these too the Greeks worshipped: but upon the earth demons, and all those who had been made gods of men: - "yet to us there is One God, the Father." In the first instance having expressed it without the word "Father," and said, "there is no God but one," he now adds this also, when he had utterly cast out the others.
Next, he adduces what indeed is the great token of divinity; "of Whom are all things."
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 8:7}
[7]  Verse 7. "But not in all is knowledge."
What knowledge does he mean? About God, or about things offered in sacrifice to idols?

{1 Cor 8:7}
[8.] "But some being used to the idol eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience being weak is defiled."
They still tremble at idols, he says. ... For their sake also he employs some reserve, saying, "But some with conscience of the things sacrificed to an idol. ... not yet being able to despise and once for all laugh them to scorn, but still in some doubt. Just as if a man were to think that by touching a dead body he should pollute himself according to the Jewish custom, and then seeing others touching it with a clear conscience, but not with the same mind touching it himself, would be polluted. This was their state of feeling at that time.
"And their conscience being weak is defiled." Nowhere as yet does he state his argument about the nature of the thing, but turns himself this way and that as concerning the conscience of the person partaking. For he was afraid lest in his wish to correct the weak person, he should inflict a heavy blow upon the strong one, and make him also weak. On which account he spares the one no less than the other. Nor does he allow the thing itself to be thought of any consequence, but makes his argument very full to prevent any suspicion of the kind.

{1 Cor 8:8}
[9.] Verse 8. "But food does not commend us to God. For neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we eat not are we the worse."
What then is this? That although no one were injured nor any perversion of another ensued, not even in this case were it right so to do. For the former topic by itself is laboring in vain. Since he that hears of another being hurt while himself has the gain, is not very apt to abstain; but then rather he does so, when he finds out that he himself is no way advantaged by the thing. Wherefore he sets this down first, saying, "But food commends us not to God." See how cheap he holds that which was accounted to spring from perfect knowledge! "For neither if we eat are we the better," (that is, stand higher in God's estimation, as if we had done anything good or great:) "nor if we eat not are we the worse," that is, fall in anyway short of others. But as he goes on, he discloses all the harm which was likely to arise from the matter.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 9.

{1 Cor 8:9}
[10.] Verse 9. "For take heed," says he, "lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling-block to the weak among the brethren."
And he said not, "This your knowledge," which would have sounded more like praise; nor "this your perfectness;" but, "your liberty;" a thing which seemed to savor more of rashness and obstinacy and arrogance. ... For let it be so that you correct them not, nor arouse them: yet why trip them up, and make them to stumble, when you ought to stretch out the hand? but for that you have no mind: well then, at least avoid casting them down.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 10.

{1 Cor 8:10}
Verse 10. "For if a man see you who hast knowledge, sitting at food in an idol's temple, will not his conscience if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?"
After having said, "Take heed lest this your liberty become a stumbling-block," he explains how and in what manner it becomes so: and he continually employs the term "weakness," that the mischief may not be thought to arise from the nature of the thing, nor demons appear formidable.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 10.

{1 Cor 8:11}
Verse 11. "And through your food he that is weak perish, the brother for whose sake Christ died."
For there are two things which deprive you of excuse in this mischief; one, that he is weak, the other, that he is your brother: rather, I should say, there is a third also, and one more terrible than all. What then is this? That whereas Christ refused not even to die for him, you cannot bear even to accommodate yourself to him.
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 10.

{1 Cor 8:12}
Verse 12. "And thus sinning against the brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ."
Do you observe how quietly and gradually he has brought their offense up to the very summit of iniquity? And again, he makes mention of the infirmity of the other sort: and so, the very thing which these considered to make for them, that he everywhere turns round upon their own head. And he said not, "Putting stumbling-blocks in their way," but, "wounding;" so as by the force of his expression to indicate their cruelty. For what can be more savage than a man who wounds the sick?
John Chrysostom, Homily 20 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 10.
.
 {1 Cor 8:13}
[11.] Verse 13. "Wherefore, if food make my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh forever."
This is like the best of teachers, to teach in his own person the things which he speaks. Nor did he say whether justly or unjustly; but in any case. "I say not," (such is his tone,) "food offered in sacrifice to an idol, which is already prohibited for another reason; but if any even of those things which are within license and are permitted causes stumbling, from these also will I abstain: and not one or two days, but all the time of my life." For he says, "I will eat no flesh forever." And he said not, "Lest I destroy my brother," but simply, "That I make not my brother to stumble." ...
Now these things might be seasonably spoken not to them only, but also to us, apt as we are to esteem lightly the salvation of our neighbors and to utter those satanical words. I say, satanical: for the expression, "What care I, though such a one stumble, and such another perish?" savors of his cruelty and inhuman mind. ...

{1 Cor 8:13; Acts 20:34}
Whenever then you see one driving nails, smiting with a hammer, covered with soot, do not therefore hold him cheap, but rather for that reason admire him. Since even Peter girded himself, and handled the dragnet, and went a fishing after the Resurrection of the Lord.
And why say I Peter? For this same Paul himself, after his incessant running to and fro and all those vast miracles, standing in a tent-maker's shop, sewed hides together: while angels were reverencing him and demons trembling. And he was not ashamed to say, (Acts 20:34.) "To my necessities, and to those who were with me, these hands ministered." What say I, that he was not ashamed? Yea, he gloried in this very thing.

{1 Cor 7:1-2}
"Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman. But because of fornications, let each man have his own wife; and let each woman have her own husband."
HAVING corrected the three heaviest things laid to their charge, one, the distraction of the Church, another, about the fornicator, a third, about the covetous person, he thenceforth uses a milder sort of speech. And he interposes some exhortation and advice about marriage and virginity, giving the hearers some respite from more unpleasant subjects. ... Wherefore he says, "Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me." For they had written to him, "Whether it was right to abstain from one's wife, or not:" and writing back in answer to this and giving rules about marriage, he introduces also the discourse concerning virginity: "It is good for a man not to touch a woman." "For if," says he, "you inquire what is the excellent and greatly superior course, it is better not to have any connection whatever with a woman: but if you ask what is safe and helpful to your own infirmity, be connected by marriage."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 7:1-2}
But since it was likely, as also happens now, that the husband might be willing but the wife not, or perhaps the reverse, mark how he discusses each case. Some indeed say that this discourse was addressed by him to elders. But I, judging from what follows, could not affirm that it was so: since he would not have given his advice in general terms. For if he were writing these things only for the elders, he would have said, "It is good for the teacher not to touch a woman." But now he has made it of universal application, saying, "It is good for a man;" not for elder only. ...  And in saying, "Because of fornications, let every man have his own wife" by the very cause alleged for the concession he guides men to continence.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 7:3; Gen 3:16; Eph 5:25; Eph 5:33}
[2.] Verse 3. "Let the husband pay the wife the honor due to her: in like manner the wife the husband."
Now what is the meaning of "the due honor? The wife has not power over her own body;" but is both the slave and the mistress of the husband. And if you decline the service which is due, you have offended God. But if you wish to withdraw yourself, it must be with the husband's permission, though it be but for a short time. For this is why he calls the matter a debt, to show that no one is master of himself but that they are servants to each other.
When therefore you see a harlot tempting you, say, "My body is not mine, but my wife's." The same also let the woman say to those who would undermine her chastity, "My body is not mine, but my husband's." Now if neither husband nor wife has power even over their own body, much less have they over their property. Hear you, all that have husbands and all that have wives: that if you must not count your body your own, much less your money.
Elsewhere I grant He gives to the husband abundant precedence, both in the New Testament, and the Old saying, (Genesis 3:16.) "Your turning shall be towards your husband, and he shall rule over you." Paul does so too by making a distinction thus, and writing, (Ephesians 5:25, 33.) "Husbands, love your wives; and let the wife see that she reverence her husband." But in this place we hear no more of greater and less, but it is one and the same right. Now why is this? Because his speech was about chastity. "In all other things," says he, "let the husband have the prerogative; but not so where the question is about chastity." "The husband has no power over his own body, neither the wife." There is great equality of honor, and no prerogative.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 7:5}
[3.] Verse 5. "Defraud you not one the other, except it be by consent."
What then can this mean? "Let not the wife," says he, "exercise continence, if the husband be unwilling; nor yet the husband without the wife's consent." Why so? Because great evils spring from this sort of continence. For adulteries and fornications and the ruin of families have often arisen from hence. For if when men have their own wives they commit fornication, much more if you defraud them of this consolation. And well says he, "Defraud not; fraud" here, and "debt" above, that he might show the strictness of the right of dominion in question. For that one should practice continence against the will of the other is "defrauding;" but not so, with the other's consent: any more than I count myself defrauded, if after persuading me you take away anything of mine. Since only he defrauds who takes against another's will and by force-a thing which many women do, working sin rather than righteousness, and thereby becoming accountable for the husband's uncleanness, and rending all asunder. Whereas they should value concord above all things, since this is more important than all beside.
...
We will, if you please, consider it with a view to actual cases. Thus, suppose a wife and husband, and let the wife be continent, without consent of her husband; well then, if hereupon he commit fornication, or though abstaining from fornication fret and grow restless and be heated and quarrel and give all kind of trouble to his wife; where is all the gain of the fasting and the continence, a breach being made in love? There is none. ...
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 7:5}
 "Defraud not one another, unless it be by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to prayer." It is prayer with unusual earnestness which he here means. For if he is forbidding those who have intercourse with one another to pray, how could "pray without ceasing" have any place? It is possible then to live with a wife and yet give heed to prayer. But by continence prayer is made more perfect. For he did not say merely, "That you may pray;" but, "That you may give yourselves to it;" as though what he speaks of might cause not uncleanness but much occupation.
 John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 7:5}
"And may be together again, that Satan tempt you not." Thus lest it should seem to be a matter of express enactment, he adds the reason. And what is it? "That Satan tempt you not." And that you may understand that it is not the devil only who causes this crime, I mean adultery, he adds, "because of your incontinency."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 7:6}
"But this I say by way of permission, not of commandment. For I would that all men were even as I myself; That is, in a state of continence. This he does in many places when he is advising about difficult matters; he brings forward himself, and says, "Be you imitators of me."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 7:7-9}
"Howbeit each man has his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that."
Thus since he had heavily charged them saying, "for your incontinence," he again comforts them by the words, "each one has his own gift of God;" not declaring that towards that virtue there is no need of zeal on our part, but, as I was saying before, to comfort them. For if it be a "gift," and man contributes nothing thereunto, how say you, "But (v. 8.) I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I (v. 9.) but if they have not continency let them marry?" Do you see the strong sense of Paul how he both signifies that continence is better, and yet puts no force on the person who cannot attain to it; fearing lest some offense arise?
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 7:9}
"For it is better to marry than to burn."
He indicates how great is the tyranny of concupiscence. What he means is something like this: "If you have to endure much violence and burning desire, withdraw yourself from your pains and toils, lest haply you be subverted."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 7:10-11; Mt 5:32; Mt 19:9; Mk 10:11; Lk 16:18}
[4.] Verse 10. "But to the married I give charge, yet not I, but the Lord."
Because it is a law expressly appointed by Christ which he is about to read to them about the "not putting away a wife without fornication; (Matthew 5:32; 19:9; Mark 10:11; Luke 16:18.) therefore he says, "Not I." True it is what was before spoken though it were not expressly stated, yet it also is His decree. But this, you see, He had delivered in express words. So that the words "I and not I" have this difference of meaning. For that you might not imagine even his own words to be human, therefore he added, "For I think that I also have the Spirit of God." Now what is that which "to the married the Lord commanded?" That the wife depart not from her husband: (v. 11.) but if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband." Here, seeing that both on the score of continence and other pretexts, and because of infirmities of temper, it fell out that separations took place: it were better, he says, that such things should not be at all; but however if they take place, let the wife remain with her husband, if not to cohabit with him, yet so as not to introduce any other to be her husband.

Verse 12. "But to the rest speak I, not the Lord. If any brother have a wife that believes not, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. And if any woman has a husband that believes not, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
In this case he provides for the abundant easiness of the duty, saying, "If any wife have a husband, or husband a wife, that believes not, let him not leave her." What say you? "If he be an unbeliever, let him remain with the wife, but not if he be a fornicator? And yet fornication is a less sin than unbelief." I grant, fornication is a less sin: but God spares your infirmities extremely. And this is what He does about the sacrifice, saying, (Matthew 5:24.) "Leave the sacrifice, and be reconciled to your brother." This also in the case of the man who owed ten thousand talents. For him too He did not punish for owing him ten thousand talents, but for demanding back a hundred pence from his fellow-servant He took vengeance on him.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:12}
Then lest the woman might fear, as though she became unclean because of intercourse with her husband, he says, "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband." And yet, if "he that is joined to an harlot is one body," it is quite clear that the woman also who is joined to an idolater is one body. Well: it is one body; nevertheless she becomes not unclean, but the cleanness of the wife overcomes the uncleanness of the husband; and again, the cleanness of the believing husband overcomes the uncleanness of the unbelieving wife.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:12; 1 Cor 6:16}
How then in this case is the uncleanness overcome, and therefore the intercourse allowed; while in the woman who prostitutes herself, the husband is not condemned in casting her out? Because here there is hope that the lost member may be saved through the marriage; but in the other case the marriage has already been dissolved; and there again both are corrupted; but here the fault is in one only of the two. I mean something like this: she that has been guilty of fornication is utterly abominable: if then "he that is joined to a harlot is one body," he also becomes abominable by having connection with an harlot; wherefore all the purity flits away. But in the case before us it is not so. But how? The idolater is unclean but the woman is not unclean. For if indeed she were a partner with him in that wherein he is unclean, I mean his impiety, she herself would also become unclean. But now the idolater is unclean in one way, and the wife holds communion with him in another wherein he is not unclean. For marriage and mixture of bodies is that wherein the communion consists.
Again, there is a hope that this man may be reclaimed by his wife for she is made completely his own: but for the other it is not very easy. For how will she who dishonored him in former times and became another's and destroyed the rights of marriage, have power to reclaim him whom she had wronged; him, moreover, who still remains to her as an alien?
Again in that case, after the fornication the husband is not a husband: but here, although the wife be an idolatress, the husband's rights are not destroyed.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:13-14}
However, he does not simply recommend cohabitation with the unbeliever, but with the qualification that he wills it. Wherefore he said, "And he himself be content to dwell with her." For, tell me, what harm is there when the duties of piety remain unimpaired and there are good hopes about the unbeliever, that those already joined should so abide and not bring in occasions of unnecessary warfare? For the question now is not about those who have never yet come together, but about those who are already joined. He did not say, If anyone wish to take an unbelieving wife, but, "If anyone has an unbelieving wife." Which means, If any after marrying or being married have received the word of godliness, and then the other party which had continued in unbelief still yearn for them to dwell together, let not the marriage be broken off. "For," says he, "the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife." So great is the superabundance of your purity.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:14}
What then, is the Greek [i.e., unbeliever] holy? Certainly not: for he said not, He is holy; but, "He is sanctified in his wife." And this he said, not to signify that he is holy, but to deliver the woman as completely as possible from her fear and lead the man to desire the truth. For the uncleanness is not in the bodies wherein there is communion, but in the mind and the thoughts. And here follows the proof; namely, that if you continuing unclean have offspring, the child, not being of you alone, is of course unclean or half clean. But now it is not unclean. To which effect he adds, "else were your children unclean; but now are they holy;" that is, not unclean. But the Apostle calls them, "holy,"' by the intensity of the expression again casting out the dread arising from that sort of suspicion.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:15}
Verse 15. "Yet if the unbelieving depart, let him depart,"
For in this case the matter is no longer that of fornication. But what is the meaning of, "if the unbelieving departs?" For instance, if he bid you sacrifice and take part in his ungodliness on account of your marriage, or else part company; it were better the marriage were annulled [?], and no breach made in godliness. Wherefore he adds, "A brother is not under bondage, nor yet a sister, in such cases." If day by day he buffet you and keep up combats on this account, it is better to separate. For this is what he glances at, saying, "But God has called us in peace." For it is the other party who furnished the ground of separation, even as he did who committed uncleanness.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:16}
Verse 16. "For how know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband?"
This again refers to that expression, "let her not leave him." That is, "if he makes no disturbance, remain," says he, "for there is even profit in this; remain and advise and give counsel and persuade." For no teacher will have such power to prevail as a wife. And neither, on one hand, does he lay any necessity upon her and absolutely demand the point of her, that he may not again do what would be too painful. Nor, on the other, does he tell her to despair: but he leaves the matter in suspense through the uncertainty of the future, saying, "For how know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O husband whether you shall save your wife?"
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 7:17-21}
[5.] ver. 17. "Only as God has distributed to each man, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. Was anyone called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Was any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. Were you called, being a slave? Care not for it." These things contribute nothing to faith, says he. Be not then contentious neither be troubled; for the faith has cast out all these things.
"Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called." Hast you been called, having an unbelieving wife? Continue to have her. Cast not out your wife for the faith's sake. Hast you been called, being a slave? Care not for it. Continue to be a slave. Hast you been called, being in uncircumcision? Remain uncircumcised. Being circumcised, did you become a believer? Continue circumcised. For this is the meaning of, "As God has distributed to each man."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 7:21}
But even if you can become free, use it rather
Astonishing, where has he put slavery! As circumcision profits not: and uncircumcision does no harm; so neither does slavery, nor yet liberty. And that he might point out this with surpassing clearness, he says, "But even if you can become free, use it rather:" that is, rather continue a slave. Now upon what possible ground does he tell the person who might be set free to remain a slave? He means to point out that slavery is no harm but rather an advantage. Now we are not ignorant that some say, the words, "use it rather," are spoken with regard to liberty: interpreting it, "if you can become free, become free." But the expression would be very contrary to Paul's manner if he intended this. For he would not, when consoling the slave and signifying that he was in no respect injured, have told him to get free. Since perhaps someone might say, "What then, if I am not able? I am an injured and degraded person." This then is not what he says: but as I said, meaning to point out that a man gets nothing by being made free, he says, "Though you have it in your power to be made free, remain rather in slavery." Next he adds also the cause:
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 7:22}
"For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's free man: likewise he that was called, being free, is Christ's bondservant."
"For," says he, "in the things that relate to Christ, both are equal: and like as you are the slave of Christ, so also is your master. How then is the slave a free man? Because He has freed you not only from sin, but also from outward slavery while continuing a slave. For he suffers not the slave to be a slave, not even though he be a man abiding in slavery: and this is the great wonder. But how is the slave a free man while continuing a slave? When he is freed from passions and the diseases of the mind: when he looks down upon riches and wrath and all other the like passions.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 7:23}
Verse 23. "You were bought with a price: become not bondservants of men."
This saying is addressed not to slaves only but also to free men. For it is possible for one who is a slave not to be a slave; and for one who is a freeman to be a slave. "And how can one be a slave and not a slave?" When he dos all for God: when he feigns nothing, and dos nothing out of eye-service towards men: that is how one that is a slave to men can be free. Or again, how does one that is free become a slave? When he serves men in any evil service, either for gluttony or desire of wealth or for office' sake. For such a one, though he be free, is more of a slave than any man.
And consider both these points. Joseph was a slave but not a slave to men: wherefore even in slavery he was freer than all that are free. For instance, he yielded not to his mistress; yielded not to the purposes which she who possessed him desired. Again she was free; yet none ever so like a slave, courting and beseeching her own servant. But she prevailed not on him, who was free, to do what he would not. This then was not slavery; but it was liberty of the most exalted kind. For what impediment to virtue had he from his slavery?
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 7:21-24}
[6.] Such a thing is Christianity; in slavery it bestows freedom. ... For this cause his bidding is, "remain a slave." But if it is impossible for one who is a slave to be a Christian such as he ought to be, the Greeks will condemn true religion to be of great weakness. However, if they can be taught that slavery in no way impairs godliness, they will admire our doctrine. For if death hurts us not, nor scourges, nor chains, much less slavery. Fire and iron and tyrannies innumerable and diseases and poverty and wild beasts and countless things more dreadful than these, have not been able to injure the faithful; nay, they have made them even mightier. And how shall slavery be able to hurt? It is not slavery itself, beloved, that hurts; but the real slavery is that of sin.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 6.

{1 Cor 7:25}
[7.] Verse 25. "Now concerning virgins. I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful."
Advancing on his way in regular order, he proceeds next to speak concerning virginity. For after that he had exercised and trained them, in his words concerning continence, he goes forth towards what is greater, saying, "I have no commandment, but I esteem it to be good."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 7:27}
Verse 27. "Are you bound to a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife."
Then, lest this should seem to be laying down a law, he subjoins, "but if you marry, you have not sinned." He next alleges the existing state of things, "the present distress, the shortness of the time," and "the affliction." For marriage draws along with it many things, which indeed he has glanced at, as well here as also in the discourse about continence: there, by saying, "the wife has not power over herself;" and here, by the expression, "You are bound."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 7:28}
"But if and you marry, you have not sinned."
He is not speaking about her who has made choice of virginity, for if it comes to that, she has sinned. Since if the widows are condemned for having to do with second marriages after they have once chosen widowhood, much more the virgins.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 7:28}
"But such shall have trouble in the flesh."
"And pleasure too," you will say: but observe how he curtails this by the shortness of the time, saying, "the time is shortened;" that is, "we are exhorted to depart now and go forth, but you are running further in." And yet even although marriage had no troubles, even so we ought to press on towards things to come. But when it has affliction too, what need to draw on one's self an additional burden. What occasion to take up such a load, when even after taking it you must use it as having it not? For "those even that have wives must be as though they had none."
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 7:35}
Verse 35. "And this I say for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
Let the virgins hear that not by that one point is virginity defined; for she that is careful about the things of the world cannot be a virgin, nor seemly. Thus, when he said, "There is difference between a wife and a virgin," he added this as the difference: ... For the evil is not in the cohabitation, but in the impediment to the strictness of life.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 7:36}
Verse 36. "But if any man think that he behaves himself unseemly toward his virgin."
Here he seems to be talking about marriage; but all that he says relates to virginity; for he allows even a second marriage [after death], saying, "only in the Lord." Now what means, "in the Lord?" With chastity, with honor: for this is needed everywhere, and must be pursued; for else we cannot see God.
John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{Typology; 1 Cor 10:1-5}
Chapter 10 Ver. 1-5: "For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual food; and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual Rock that followed them: and the Rock was Christ. Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased."
And wherefore says he these things? To point out that as they [the Israelites] were nothing profited by the enjoyment of so great a gift, so neither these by obtaining Baptism and partaking of spiritual Mysteries, except they go on and show forth a life worthy of this grace. Wherefore also he introduces the types both of Baptism and of the Mysteries.
But what is, "They were baptized into Moses?" Like as we, on our belief in Christ and His resurrection, are baptized, as being destined in our own persons to partake in the same mysteries; for, "we are baptized," says he, "for the dead," i.e., for our own bodies; even so they putting confidence in Moses, i.e., having seen him cross first, ventured also themselves into the waters. But because he wishes to bring the Type near the Truth; he speaks it not thus, but uses the terms of the Truth even concerning the Type.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{Typology; 1 Cor 10:1-5}
Further: this was a symbol of the Font, and that which follows, of the Holy Table. For as you eat the Lord's Body, so they the manna: and as you drink the Blood, so they water from a rock. For though they were things of sense which were produced, yet were they spiritually exhibited, not according to the order of nature, but according to the gracious intention of the gift, and together with the body nourished also the soul, leading it to faith.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 10:4}
"They drank the same spiritual drink for they drank of a spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ."
For it was not the nature of the rock which sent forth the water, (such is his meaning,) else would it as well have gushed out before this time: but another sort of Rock, a spiritual One, performed the whole, even Christ who was everywhere with them and wrought all the wonders. For on this account he said, "that followed them." ... "For He who set those things before them," says he, "the same also has prepared this our Table: and the same Person both brought them through the sea and you through Baptism; and before them set manna, but before you His Body and Blood."
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 10:5}
[4.] Wherefore also he added, "Howbeit with most of them God was not well-pleased;" although He had honored them with so great honor. ... Their number profited them nothing: and these were all so many tokens of love; but not even did this profit them, inasmuch as they did not themselves show forth the fruits of love. Thus, since most men disbelieve the things said of hell, as not being present nor in sight; he alleges the things heretofore done as a proof that God does punish all who sin, even though He have bestowed innumerable benefits upon them: "for if you disbelieve the things to come," so he speaks, "yet surely the things that are past you will not disbelieve."
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:5}
Verse 5. "For they were overthrown," says he, "in the wilderness."
Declaring by this word both the sweeping destruction, and the punishments and the vengeance inflicted by God, and that they did not so much as attain to the rewards proposed to them. ... And what are these things to us? say you. ... Wherefore also he adds,
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:6}
Verse 6. "Now these things were figures of us."
For as the gifts are figures, even so are the punishments figures: and as Baptism and the Table were sketched out prophetically, so also by what ensued, the certainty of punishment coming on those who are unworthy of this gift was proclaimed beforehand for our sake that we by these examples might learn soberness. Wherefore also he adds, "To the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted." For as in the benefits the types went before and the substance followed, such shall be the order also in the punishments. See you how he signifies not only the fact that these shall be punished, but also the degree, more severely than those ancients? For if the one be type, and the other substance, it must needs be that the punishments should as far exceed as the gifts. And see whom he handles first: those who eat in the idol-temples. For having said, "that we should not lust after evil things," which was general, he subjoins that which is particular, implying that each of their sins arose from evil lusting.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:7}
Verse 7. "Neither be you idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, 'the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.'"
Do you hear how he even calls them "idolaters?" here indeed making the declaration, but afterwards bringing the proof. And he assigned the cause too wherefore they ran to those tables; and this was gluttony. Wherefore having said, "to the intent that we should not lust after evil things," and having added, nor "be idolaters," he names the cause of such transgression; and this was gluttony. "For the people sat down," says he, "to eat and to drink," and he adds the end thereof, "they rose up to play." "For even as they," says he, "from sensuality passed into idolatry; so there is a fear lest you also may fall from the one into the other."
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:8}
"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed."
Why does he here make mention of fornication? ... This then Paul also does here, at the same time both reminding them of that sin, and teaching that the parent of this evil also was luxury and gluttony. Wherefore also he adds, "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand." ... In the matter of Balaam, when they joined themselves to Baalpeor, the Midianite women appearing in the camp and alluring them to wantonness according to the counsel of Balaam.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:9}
Verse 9. "Neither let us test Christ, as some of them also tested, and perished by serpents."
By this he again hints at another charge which he likewise states at the end, blaming them because they contended about signs. And indeed they were destroyed on account of trials, saying, "when will the good things come? when the rewards?"
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:10}
Verse 10. "Neither murmur you, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer."
For what is required is not only to suffer for Christ, but also nobly to bear the things that come on us, and with all gladness: since this is the nature of every crown. ... Wherefore, both the Apostles when they were beaten rejoiced, and Paul gloried in his sufferings.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:11}
[5.] Verse 11. "Now all these things happened to them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come."
Again he terrifies them speaking of the "ends," and prepares them to expect things greater than had already taken place. "For that we shall suffer punishment is manifest," says he, "from what has been said, even to those who disbelieve the statements concerning hell-fire; but that the punishment also will be most severe, is evident, from the more numerous blessings which we have enjoyed, and from the things of which those were but figures. Since, if in the gifts one go beyond the other, it is most evident that so it will be in the punishment likewise." ... But when he said, "the ends of the ages," he means nothing else than that the fearful judgment is henceforth nigh at hand.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 10:12}
Verse 12. "Wherefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall."
For our standing here is not secure standing, no not until we be delivered out of the waves of this present life and have sailed into the tranquil haven. Be not therefore high-minded at your standing, but guard against your falling; for if Paul feared who was firmer than all, much more ought we to fear.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 10:12; Ps 95:2[LXX]}
[7.] Considering therefore the greatness of His mercy, let us here make Him propitious to us, and "let us come before His face by a full confession," (Psalm 95:2. LXX.) that we may not depart hence without excuse, and have to endure the extreme punishment. For if in the present life we exhibit even an ordinary diligence, we shall gain the great rewards: but if we depart having become nothing better here, even though we repent ever so earnestly there it will do us no good. For it was our duty to strive while yet remaining within the lists, not after the assembly was broken up idly to lament and weep: as that rich man did, bewailing and deploring himself, but to no purpose and in vain, since he overlooked the time in which he ought to have done these things.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.


{1 Cor 10:14}
[2.] Verse 14. "Wherefore, my brethren, flee from idolatry."
Again he courts them by the name of kindred, and urges them to be rid of this sin with all speed. For he did not say, simply, depart, but "flee;" and he calls the matter "idolatry," and no longer bids them quit it merely on account of the injury to their neighbor, but signifies that the very thing of itself is sufficient to bring a great destruction. [referring to 1 Cor. 8]
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 10:15}
Verse 15. "I speak as to wise men: judge you what I say."
That he might not seem to exasperate them and to make his speech disgusting, in what follows he refers the decision to them, and sets his judges down on their tribunal with an encomium. "For I speak as to wise men," says he: which is the mark of one very confident of his own rights, that he should make the accused himself the judge of his allegations.
Thus also he more elevates the hearer, when he discourses not as commanding nor as laying down the law, but as advising with them and as actually pleading before them. ... And he discourses as with friends, and says, "I need no other judges, do you yourselves pass this sentence upon me, I take you for arbiters."
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 10:16}
[3.] Verse 16. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the Blood of Christ?"
What say you, O blessed Paul? When you would appeal to the hearer's reverence, when you are making mention of awesome mysteries, do you give the title of "cup of blessing" to that fearful and most tremendous cup? "Yea," says he; "and no mean title is that which was spoken. For when I call it 'blessing,' I mean thanksgiving, and when I call it thanksgiving I unfold all the treasure of God's goodness, and call to mind those mighty gifts." ... "How then are not your doings inconsistent," says he, "O you Corinthians; blessing God for delivering you from idols, yet running again to their tables?" "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the Blood of Christ?". Very persuasively spoke he, and awfully. For what he says is this: "This which is in the cup is that which flowed from His side, and of that do we partake." But he called it a cup of blessing, because holding it in our hands, we so exalt Him in our hymn, wondering, astonished at His unspeakable gift, blessing Him, among other things, for the pouring out of this self-same draught that we might not abide in error: and not only for the pouring it out, but also for the imparting thereof to us all.
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 10:16}
[4.] "The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the Body of Christ?"
Wherefore said he not, the participation? Because he intended to express something more and to point out how close was the union: in that we communicate not only by participating and partaking, but also by being united. For as that body is united to Christ, so also are we united to him by this bread. But why adds he also, "which we break?" For although in the Eucharist one may see this done, yet on the cross not so, but the very contrary. For, "A bone of Him," says one, "shall not be broken." But that which He suffered not on the cross, this He suffers in the oblation for your sake, and submits to be broken, that he may fill all men. Further, because he said, "a communion of the Body," and that which communicates is another thing from that whereof it communicates; even this which seems to be but a small difference, he took away.
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:17}
Verse 17. "For we, who are many, are one bread, one body."
"For why speak I of communion?" says he, "we are that self-same body." For what is the bread? The Body of Christ. And what do they become who partake of it? The Body of Christ: not many bodies, but one body. For as the bread consisting of many grains is made one, so that the grains nowhere appear; they exist indeed, but their difference is not seen by reason of their conjunction; so are we conjoined both with each other and with Christ: there not being one body for you, and another for your neighbor to be nourished by, but the very same for all. Wherefore also he adds, "For we all partake of the one bread." Now if we are all nourished of the same and all become the same, why do we not also show forth the, same love, and become also in this respect one?
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 10:18}
[5.] Verse 18. "Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?"
Again, from the old covenant he leads them to this point also. ... And what he says is of this nature: "even from persons of the grosset sort you may be instructed that they who eat the sacrifices, have communion with the altar." Do you see how he intimates that they who seemed to be perfect have not perfect knowledge, if they know not even this, that the result of these sacrifices to many oftentimes is a certain communion and friendship with devils, the practice drawing them on by degrees? For if among men the fellowship of salt and the table becomes an occasion and token of friendship, it is possible that this may happen also in the case of devils.
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 10:18}
But do you, I pray, consider, how with regard to the Jews he said not, "they are partakers with God," but, "they have communion with the altar;" for what was placed thereon was burnt: but in respect to the Body of Christ, not so. But how? It is "a communion of the Lord's Body." For not with the altar, but with Christ Himself, do we have communion.
But having said that they have "communion with the altar," afterwards fearing lest he should seem to discourse as if the idols had any power and could do some injury, see again how he overthrows them, saying,

{1 Cor 10:19}
Verse 19. "What say I then? That an idol is anything? or that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything?"
As if he had said, "Now these things I affirm, and try to withdraw you from the idols, not as though they could do any injury or had any power: for an idol is nothing; but I wish you to despise them." "And if you will have us despise them," says one, "wherefore do you carefully withdraw us from them?" Because they are not offered to your Lord.

Verse 20. "For that which the Gentiles sacrifice," says he, "they sacrifice to demons, and not to God."
Do not then run to the contrary things. For neither if you were a king's son, and having the privilege of your father's table, should leave it and choose to partake of the table of the condemned and the prisoners in the dungeon, would your father permit it, but with great vehemence he would withdraw you; not as though the table could harm you, but because it disgraces your nobility and the royal table. For verily these too are servants who have offended; dishonored, condemned, prisoners reserved for intolerable punishment, accountable for ten thousand crimes. How then are you not ashamed to imitate the gluttonous and vulgar crew, in that when these condemned persons set out a table, you run thither and partake of the viands? Here is the cause why I seek to withdraw you. For the intention of the sacrificers, and the person of the receivers, makes the things set before you unclean.

And this he said, reminding them of an ancient history and of their fathers' transgression. ... "For they," says He, "moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God; they provoked Me to anger with their idols." (Deuteronomy 32:21.) "Are we stronger than He?"

For to this that fearful and tremendous sacrifice leads us, warning us above all things to approach it with one mind and fervent love, and thereby becoming eagles, so to mount up to the very heaven, nay, even beyond the heaven. "For wherever the carcass is," says He, "there also will be the eagles," (Matthew 24:28.) calling His body a carcass by reason of His death. For unless He had fallen, we should not have risen again. But He calls us eagles, implying that he who draws nigh to this Body must be on high and have nothing common with the earth, nor wind himself downwards and creep along; but must ever be soaring heavenwards, and look on the Sun of Righteousness, and have the eye of his mind quick-sighted. For eagles, not crows, have a right to this table.

{Heb 10:5-10; 1 Pet 1:18-19; Heb 9:11-14}
For if one would not inconsiderately receive a king -one would not choose to venture on it with polluted hands: I say now, if even a man's garment be what one would not venture inconsiderately to touch, what shall we say of the Body of Him Who is God over all, spotless, pure, associate with the Divine Nature, the Body whereby we are, and live; whereby the gates of Hades were broken down and the sanctuaries of heaven opened? how shall we receive this with so great insolence? Let us not, I pray you, let us not slay ourselves by our irreverence, but with all awfulness and purity draw nigh to It; and when you see It set before thee, say you to thyself, "Because of this Body am I no longer earth and ashes, no longer a prisoner, but free: because of this I hope for heaven, and to receive the good things therein, immortal life, the portion of angels, converse with Christ; this Body, nailed and scourged, was more than death could stand against; this Body the very sun saw sacrificed, and turned aside his beams; for this both the veil was rent in that moment, and rocks were burst asunder, and all the earth was shaken. This is even that Body, the blood-stained, the pierced, and that out of which gushed the saving fountains, the one of blood, the other of water, for all the world."
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{Col 2:15}
The Body that was crucified. By this were [Satan's] goads broken in pieces; by this was his head crushed; by this were the powers and the principalities made a show of. "For," says he, "having put off from himself principalities and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it." (Colossians 2:15.)
Ask also Death, and say, "whence is it that thy sting hath been taken away? thy victory abolished? thy sinews cut out? and you become the laughing-stock of girls and children, who was before a terror even to kings and to all righteous men?" And he will ascribe it to this Body. For when this was crucified, then were the dead raised up, then was that prison burst, and the gates of brass were broken, and the dead were loosed, and the keepers of the gates of Hades all cowered in fear. And yet, had He been one of the many, death on the contrary should have become more mighty; but it was not so. For He was not one of the many. Therefore was death dissolved. And as they who take food which they are unable to retain, On account of that vomit up also what was before lodged in them; so also it happened unto death. That Body, which he could not digest, he received: and therefore had to cast forth that which he had within him.
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{Acts 11:24; Ps 19:5}
Yes, Death travailed in pain, whilst he held Him, and was straitened until He vomited Him up. Wherefore says the Apostle, "Having loosed the pains of death." (Acts 11:24.) For never woman laboring of child was so full of anguish as he was torn and racked in sunder, while he held the Body of the Lord. And that which happened to the Babylonian dragon, when, having taken the food it burst asunder in the midst this also happened unto him. For Christ came not forth again by the mouth of death, but having burst asunder and ripped up in the very midst, the belly of the dragon, thus from His secret chambers (Psalm 19:5.) right gloriously He issued forth and flung abroad His beams not to this heaven alone, but to the very throne most high. For even thither did He carry it up. This Body hath He given to us both to hold and to eat; a thing appropriate to intense love. For those whom we kiss vehemently, we oft-times even bite with our teeth.
John Chrysostom, Homily 24 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{Job 31:31}
Wherefore also Job, indicating the love of his servants towards him, said, that they ofttimes, out of their great affection towards him, said, "Oh! that we were filled with his flesh!" (Job 31:31.) Even so Christ hath given to us to be filled with His flesh, drawing us on to greater love.

{1 Cor 10:25}
[1]
1 Cor. 10:25: Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
HAVING said that "they could not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of the devils," and having once for all led them away from those tables, by Jewish examples, by human reasonings, by the tremendous Mysteries, by the rites solemnized among the idols; and having filled them with great fear; that he might not by this fear drive again to another extreme, and they be forced, exercising a greater scrupulosity than was necessary, to feel alarm, lest possibly even without their knowledge there might come in some such thing either from the market or from some other quarter; to release them from this strait, he says, "Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question." "For," says he, "if you eat in ignorance and not knowingly, you are not subject to the punishment: it being thenceforth a matter not of greediness, but of ignorance."
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 10:25}
Nor does he free the man only from this anxiety, but also from another, establishing them in thorough security and liberty. For he does not even suffer them to "question;" i.e., to search and inquire, whether it be an idol-sacrifice or no such thing; but simply to eat everything which comes from the market, not even acquainting one's self with so much as this, what it is that is act before us. So that even he that eat, if in ignorance, may be rid of anxiety. For such is the nature of those things which are not in their essence evil, but through the man's intention make him unclean. Wherefore he says, "asking no question."
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 10:26}
Verse 26. "For to the Lord belongs the earth and the fullness thereof."
Not to the devils. Now if the earth and the fruits and the beasts be all His, nothing is unclean: but it becomes unclean otherwise, from our intention and our disobedience. Wherefore he not only gave permission, but also,
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

 {1 Cor 10:27}
Verse 27. "If one of them that believe not bids you," says he, "to a feast, and you are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake."
See again his moderation. For he did not command and make a law that they should withdraw themselves, yet neither did he forbid it. And again, should they depart, he frees them from all suspicion. Now what may be the account of this? That so great curiousness might not seem to arise from any fear and cowardice. For he who makes scrupulous inquiry does so as being in dread: but he who, on hearing the fact, abstains, abstains as out of contempt and hatred and aversion. Wherefore Paul, purposing to establish both points, says, "Whatsoever is set before you, eat."
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 10:26-28}
Verse 28. "But if any man say to you, This has been offered in sacrifice to idols; eat not, for his sake that showed it."
Thus it is not at all for any power that the demons have, but as accursed, that he bids abstain from them. Neither then, as though they could injure you, fly from them, (for they have no strength;) nor yet, because they have no strength, indifferently partake: for it is the table of beings who are hostile and degraded. Wherefore he said, "eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake. For the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."
See you how both when he bids them eat and when they must abstain, he brings forward the same testimony? "For I do not forbid," says he, "for this cause as though they belonged to others: ("for the earth is the Lord's") but for the reason I mentioned, for conscience sake; i.e., that it may not be injured." Ought one therefore to inquire scrupulously? "Nay" says he "for I said not your conscience, but his. For I have already said, 'for his sake that showed it."'
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 10:28-29; 1 Cor 5:12}
[2.] But perhaps someone may say, "The brethren indeed, as is natural, you spare, and do not suffer us to taste for their sakes, lest their conscience being weak might be emboldened to eat the idol sacrifices. But if it be some heathen, what is this man to you? Was it not your own word, 'What have I to do with judging them that are without?' (1 Corinthians 5:12.) Why then do you on the contrary care for them?" "Not for him is my care," he replies, "but in this case also for you." To which effect also he adds, "For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?" meaning by "liberty," that which is left without caution or prohibition. For this is liberty, freed from Jewish bondage. And what he means is this: "God has made me free and above all reach of injury, but the Gentile knows not how to judge my rule of life, nor to see into the liberality of my Master, but will condemn and say to himself, Christianity is a fable; they abstain from the idols, they shun demons, and yet cleave to the things offered to them: great is their gluttony.'" "And what then?" it may be said. "What harm is it to us, should he judge us unfairly?" But how much better to give him no room to judge at all'. For if you abstain, he will not even say this. "How," say you, "will he not say it? For when he sees me not making these inquiries, either in the shambles or in the banquet; what should hinder him from using this language and condemning me, as one who partakes without discrimination?" It is not so at all. For you partake, not as of idol-sacrifices, but as of things clean. And if you make no nice inquiry, it is that you may signify that you fear not the things set before you; this being the reason why, whether you enter a house of Gentiles or go into the market, I suffer you not to ask questions; viz. lest you become timid and perplexed, and occasion yourself needless trouble.
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 10:30}
 Verse 30. "If I by grace partake, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?"
"Of what do you 'by grace partake?' tell me." Of the gifts of God. For His grace is so great, as to render my soul unstained and above all pollution. For as the sun sending down his beams upon many spots of pollution, withdraws them again pure; so likewise and much more, we, living in the midst of the world remain pure, if we will, by how much the power we have is even greater than his. "Why then abstain?" say you. Not as though I should become unclean, far from it; but for my brother's sake, and that I may not become a partaker with devils, and that I may not be judged by the unbeliever. For in this case it is no longer now the nature of the thing, but the disobedience and the friendship with devils which makes me unclean, and the purpose of heart works the pollution.
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 10:30}
But what is, "why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? "I, for my part" says he "give thanks to God that He has thus set me on high, and above the low estate of the Jews, so that from no quarter am I injured. But the Gentiles not knowing my high rule of life will suspect the contrary, and will say, 'Here are Christians indulging a taste for our customs; they are a kind of hypocrites, abusing the demons and loathing them, yet running to their tables; than which what can be more senseless? We conclude that not for truth's sake, but through ambition and love of power they have betaken themselves to this doctrine.' What folly then would it be that in respect of those things whereby I have been so benefited as even to give solemn thanks, in respect of these I should become the cause of evil-speaking?" "
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 10:31-32}
[3.] Verse 31. "Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of God."
Verse 32. "Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the Church of God:"
i.e., give no handle to anyone: since in the case supposed, both your brother is offended, and the Jew will the more hate and condemn you, and the Gentile in like manner deride you even as a gluttonous man and a hypocrite. Not only, however, should the brethren receive no hurt from us, but to the utmost of our power not even those that are without. For if we are "light," and "leaven," and "luminaries," and "salt," we ought to enlighten, not to darken; to bind, not to loosen; to draw to ourselves the unbelievers, not to drive them away. Why then putt you to flight those whom you ought to draw to you? Since even Gentiles are hurt, when they see us reverting to such things: for they know not our mind nor that our Soul has come to be above all pollution of sense.
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 10:33; 1 Cor 11:1}
Verse 33. "Even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved."
Chapter 11 ver 1 "Be you imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ"
This is a rule of the most perfect Christianity, this is a landmark exactly laid down, this is the point that stands high of all; viz. the seeking those things which are for the common profit: which also Paul himself declared, by adding, "even as I also am of Christ." For nothing can so make a man an imitator of Christ as caring for his neighbors. Nay, though you should fast, though you should lie upon the ground, and even strangle yourself, but take no thought for your neighbor; you have wrought nothing great, but still stand far from this Image, while so doing.
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 10:33; Ex 32:32; 2 Sam 24:17; Gen 13:9}
[4.] For no virtuous action can be very exalted, when it does not distribute its benefit to others also: as is shown by him who brought the one talent safe, and was cut in sunder because he had not made more of it. And you then, brother, though you should remain without food, though you should sleep upon the ground, though you should eat ashes and be ever wailing, and do good to no other; you will do no great work. For so also those great and noble persons who were in the beginning made this their chief care: examine accurately their life, and you will see clearly that none of them ever looked to his own things, but each one to the things of his neighbor, whence also they shone the brighter. For so Moses (to mention him first) wrought many and great wonders and signs; but nothing made him so great as that blessed voice which he uttered to God, saying, "If You will forgive their sin," forgive.'" but if not, blot me also out." (Exodus 32:32.) Such too was David: wherefore also he said, "I the shepherd have sinned, and I have done wickedly, but these, the flock, what have they done? Let Your hand be upon me and upon my father's house." (2 Samuel 24:17.) So likewise Abraham sought not his own profit, but the profit of many. Wherefore he both exposed himself to dangers and besought God for those who in no wise belonged to him.
Well: these indeed so became glorious. But as for those who sought their own, consider what harm too they received. The nephew, for instance, of the last mentioned, because he listened to the saying, "If you will go to the right, I will go to the left;" (Genesis 13:9.) and accept-ring the choice, sought his own profit, did not even find his own: but this region was burned up, while that remained untouched. Jonah again, not seeking the profit of many, but his own, was in danger even of perishing: and while the city stood fast, he himself was tossed about and overwhelmed in the sea. But when he sought the profit of many, then he also found his own. So likewise Jacob among the flocks, not seeking his own gain, had exceeding riches for his portion. And Joseph also, seeking the profit of his brethren, found his own.
John Chrysostom, Homily 25 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 9:24}
1 Cor. 9:24: "Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize?
Now this he says, not as though here also one only out of many would be saved; far from it; but to set forth the exceeding diligence which it is our duty to use. For as there, though many descend into the course not many are crowned, but this befalls one only; and it is not enough to descend into the contest, nor to anoint one's self and wrestle: so likewise here it is not sufficient to believe, and to contend in any way; but unless we have so run as to the end to show ourselves unblameable, and to come near the prize, it will profit us nothing.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 9:25}
Verse 25. "And every man that strives in the games is temperate in all things."
What is, "all things?" He does not abstain from one and err in another, but he masters entirely gluttony and lasciviousness and drunkenness and all his passions. "For this," says he, "takes place even in the heathen games. For neither is excess of wine permitted to those who contend at the time of the contest, nor wantonness, lest they should weaken their vigor, nor yet so much as to be busied about anything else, but separating themselves altogether from all things they apply themselves to their exercise only." Now if there these things be so where the crown fails to one, much more here, where the incitement in emulation is more abundant.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 9:26; 1 Cor 8:8}
[2.] Verse 26. "I therefore so run, as not uncertainly."
But what is, "not uncertainly?" "Looking to some mark," says he, "not at random and in vain, as you do. For what profit have you of entering into idol-temples, and exhibiting forsooth that perfectness? None. But not such am I, but all things whatsoever I do, I do for the salvation of my neighbor. ... But you, why dost you eat in idol-temples, tell me? Nay, you cannot assign any reasonable cause. For "food commends you not to God; neither if you eat are you the better, nor if you eat not are you the worse." (1 Corinthians 8:8.) Plainly then you run at random: for this is, "uncertainly."
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 9:26}
"So fight I, as not beating the air."
This he says, again intimating that he acted not at random nor in vain. "For I have one at whom I may strike, i.e., the devil. But you dost not strike him, but simply throw away your strength." ... It is at the risk of no less than utter ruin to their own soul, and that even apart from all injury to their brethren, neither are they themselves guiltless in daring so to act.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 9:27}
Verse 27. "But I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected."
Here he implies that they act subject to the lust of the belly and give up the reins to it. ... For since both fornication is caused by luxury, and it also brought forth idolatry, he naturally oftentimes inveighs against this disease; and pointing out how great things he suffered for the Gospel, he sets this also down among them. "As I went," says he, "beyond the commands, and this when it was no light matter for me. ...so also here I submit to much labor in order to live soberly. Stubborn as appetite is and the tyranny of the belly, nevertheless I bridle it and give not myself up to the passion, but endure all labor not to be drawn aside by it." "For do not, I pray you, suppose that by taking things easily I arrive at this desirable result. For it is a race and a manifold struggle, and a tyrannical nature continually rising up against me and seeking to free itself. But I bear not with it but keep it down, and bring it into subjection with many struggles." Now this he says that none may despairingly withdraw from the conflicts in behalf of virtue because the undertaking is laborious. Wherefore he says, "I buffet and bring into bondage." He said not, "I kill:" nor., "I punish" for the flesh is not to be hated, but, "I buffet and bring into bondage;" which is the part of a master not of an enemy, of a teacher not of a foe.
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 9:27}
"Lest by any means, having preached to others, I myself should be a rejected."
Now if Paul feared this who had taught so many, and feared it after his preaching and becoming an angel and undertaking the leadership of the whole world; what can we say?
For, "think not," says he, "because you have believed, that this is sufficient for your salvation: since if to me neither preaching nor teaching nor bringing over innumerable persons, is enough for salvation unless I exhibit my own conduct also unblameable, much less to you."
John Chrysostom, Homily 22 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{Relationship of the Father and Son}
We acknowledge one God, uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible, incomprehensible, illimitable, who is apprehended by the understanding only and the reason, who is encompassed by light, and beauty, and spirit, and power ineffable, by whom the universe has been created through His Logos, and set in order, and is kept in being-I have sufficiently demonstrated. [I say "His Logos"], for we acknowledge also a Son of God. Nor let anyone think it ridiculous that God should have a Son. For though the poets, in their fictions, represent the gods as no better than men, our mode of thinking is not the same as theirs, concerning either God the Father or the Son. But the Son of God is the Logos of the Father, in idea and in operation; for after the pattern of Him and by Him were all things made, the Father and the Son being one. And, the Son being in the Father and the Father in the Son, in oneness and power of spirit, the understanding and reason (nous kai logos) of the Father is the Son of God.   location 24247
Athenagoras, A Plea for the Christians, Ch. 10

{Relationship of the Father and Son; Logos}
if, in your surpassing intelligence, it occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I will state briefly that He is the first product of the Father, not as having been brought into existence (for from the beginning, God, who is the eternal mind [nous], had the Logos in Himself, being from eternity instinct with Logos [logikos]); but inasmuch as He came forth to be the idea and energizing power of all material things, which lay like a nature without attributes, and an inactive earth, the heavier particles being mixed up with the lighter. location 24254

Who, then, would not be astonished to hear men who speak of God the Father, and of God the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and who declare both their power in union and their distinction in order,   location 24258

First Thales, as those who have accurately examined his opinions report, divides [superior beings] into God, demons, and heroes. God he recognises as the Intelligence (nous) of the world; by demons he understands beings possessed of soul (psuchikai); and by heroes the separated souls of men, the good being the good souls, and the bad the worthless. Plato again, while withholding his assent on other points, also divides [superior beings] into the uncreated God and those produced by the uncreated One for the adornment of heaven, the planets, and the fixed stars, and into demons;   location 24543

Just as with men, who have freedom of choice as to both virtue and vice (for you would not either honour the good or punish the bad, unless vice and virtue were in their own power; and some are diligent in the matters entrusted to them by you, and others faithless), so is it among the angels.

If this is evident, and natural and artificial powers, and the actions arising from these, must by all means be accompanied by an end in accordance with nature, it is absolutely necessary that the end of men, since it is that of a peculiar nature, should be separated from community with the rest; for it is not lawful to suppose the same end for beings destitute of rational judgment, and of those whose actions are regulated by the innate law and reason, and who live an intelligent life and observe justice.   location 25298

And we shall make no mistake in saying, that the final cause of an intelligent life and rational judgment, is to be occupied uninterruptedly with those objects to which the natural reason is chiefly and primarily adapted, and to delight unceasingly in the contemplation of Him who is, and of His decrees, notwithstanding that the majority of men, because they are affected too passionately and too violently by things below, pass through life without attaining this object. For the large number of those who fail of the end that belongs to them does not make void the common lot, since the examination relates to individuals, and the reward or punishment of lives ill or well spent is proportioned to the merit of each.   location 25317

{1 Cor 6:1}
[4.] Chapter 6:1. "Dare anyone of you, having a matter against his brother, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?"
Here also he again makes his complaint upon acknowledged grounds; for in that other place he says, "It is actually reported that there is fornication among you." And in this place, "Dare anyone of you?" From the very first outset giving signs of his anger, and implying that the thing spoken of comes of a daring and lawless spirit.
... So here, you see, since he had made mention of covetous brethren, burning with anxiety to correct those in sin, he brooks not exactly to observe order; but he again corrects the sin which had been introduced out of the regular course, and so returns to the former subject.
Let us hear then what he also says about this. "Dare any of you, having a matter, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?" ...  But when he had stricken them down by many words, then he even takes away entirely all going to law. "For in the first place," says he, "if one must go to law it were wrong to do so before the unrighteous. But you ought not to go to law at all." This however he adds afterwards. For the present he thoroughly sifts the former subject, namely, that they should not submit matters to external arbitration. "For," says he, "how can it be otherwise than absurd that one who is at variance with his friend should take his enemy to be a reconciler between them? And how can you avoid feeling shame and blushing when a Greek sits to judge a Christian? And if about private matters it is not right to go to law before Greeks, how shall we submit to their decisions about other things of greater importance?"
Observe, moreover, how he speaks. He says not, "Before the unbelievers," but, "Before the unrighteous;" using the expression of which he had most particular need for the matter before him, in order to deter and keep them away. For see that his discourse was about going to law, and those who are engaged in suits seek for nothing so much as that the judges should feel great interest about what is just; he takes this as a ground of dissuasion. ... And because it would have been intolerable to be told at once not to go to law, he did not immediately add this, but only changed the judges, bringing the party engaged in the trial from without into the Church.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.

{1 Cor 6:1-2; Mt 12:42}
[5.] Then, since it seemed easily open to contempt, I mean our being judged by those who were within, and especially at that time, (for they were not perhaps competent to comprehend a point, nor were they such as the heathen judges, well skilled in laws and rhetoric, inasmuch as the greater part of them were uneducated men,) mark how he makes them worthy of credit, first calling them "saints." But seeing that this bore witness to purity of life, and not to accuracy in hearing a case, observe how he orderly handles this part also, saying thus, "Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world?" How then can you who are in your day to judge them, endure to be judged by them now? They will not indeed judge, taking their seat in person and demanding account, yet they shall condemn. This at least he plainly said; "And if the world is judged in you, are you unworthy to judge the small matters?" He says not "by you," but "in you:" just as when He said, (Matthew 12:42.) "The queen of the south shall rise up and condemn this generation:" and, "The men of Nineveh shall arise and condemn this generation." For when beholding the same sun and sharing all the same things, we shall be found believers but they unbelievers, they will not be able to take refuge in ignorance. For we shall accuse them, simply by the things which we have done. And many such ways of judgment one will find there.
Then, that no one should think he speaks about other persons, mark how he generalizes his speech. "And if the world is judged in you, are you unworthy to judge the small matters?"
The thing is a disgrace to you, he says, and an unspeakable reproach. For since it was likely that they would be out of countenance at being judged by those that were within; "nay," says he, "on the contrary, the disgrace is when you are judged by those without: for those are the very small controversies, not these."
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 6:3; Mt 25:41; 2 Cor 11:15}
Verse 3. "Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things which pertain to this life?
Some say that here the elders are hinted at, but away with this. His speech is about demons. For had he been speaking about corrupt elders, he would have meant them above when he said, "the world is judged in you:" (for the Scripture is wont to call evil men also "The world:") and he would not have said the same thing twice, nor would he, as if he was saying something of greater consequence, have put it down afterwards. But he speaks concerning those angels about whom Christ says, "Depart you into the fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels." (Matthew 25:41.) And Paul, "his angels fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness." (2 Corinthians 11:15.) For when the very incorporeal powers shall be found inferior to us who are clothed with flesh, they shall suffer heavier punishment.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.

{1 Cor 6:4}
[6.] Verse 4. "If then you have to judge things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are of no account in the Church.
For what he says is something like this: Perhaps someone will say, "No one among you is wise, nor competent to pass sentence; all are contemptible." Now what follows? "Even though none be wise," says he, "I bid you entrust things to those who are of least weight."
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 6.

{1 Cor 6:5}
Verse 5. "But this I say to move you to shame."
These are the words of one exposing their objection as being an idle pretext: and therefore he adds, "Is it so that there is not a wise man among you, no not even one?" Is the scarcity, says he, so great? so great the want of sensible persons among you? And what he subjoins strikes even still harder. For having said, "Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one?" he adds, "who shall be able to judge in the case of his brother." For when brother goes to law with brother, there is never any need of understanding and talent in the person who is mediating in the cause, the feeling and relationship contributing greatly to the settlement of such a quarrel.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 6.

{1 Cor 6:6}
"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers."
Do you observe with what effect he disparaged the judges at first by calling them unrighteous; whereas here, to move shame, he calls them Unbelievers? For surely it is extremely disgraceful if the elder could not be the author of reconciliation even among brethren, but recourse must be had to those without. So that when he said, "those who are of no account," his chief meaning was not that the Church's outcasts should be appointed as judges, but to find fault with them. ... For what else can it be than absurd, that whereas on a quarrel arising in a house we call in no one from without and feel ashamed if news get abroad among strangers of what is going on within doors; where the Church is, the treasure of the unutterable Mysteries, there all things should be published without?
Verse 6. "But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers."
The charge is twofold; both that he "goes to law," and "before the unbelievers." For if even the thing by itself, To go to law with a brother, be a fault, to do it also before aliens, what pardon does it admit of?
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 6.

{1 Cor 6:7}
[7.] Verse 7. "Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another."
Thus far, the act itself of going to law brings each party under his censure, and in that respect one is not at all better than another. But whether one go to law justly or unjustly, that is quite another subject. Say not then, "which did the wrong?" For on this ground I at once condemn you, even for the act of going to law. Now if being unable to bear a wrong-doer be a fault, what accusation can come up to the actual wrong? "Why not rather take wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?"
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 6:8}
Verse 8. "Nay, you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."
Again, it is a twofold crime, perhaps even threefold or fourfold. One, not to know how to bear being wronged. Another, actually to do wrong. A third, to commit the settlement of these matters even to the unjust. And yet a fourth, that it should be so done to a brother.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 7.

{1 Cor 6:9-10}
[8.] Having thus, you see, abashed them from arguments on general principles, and before that, from the rewards proposed; he shuts up the exhortation with a threat, making his speech more peremptory, and saying thus, (ver. 9.) "Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, (ver. 10.) nor covetous, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." What say you? When discoursing about covetous persons, have you brought in upon us so vast a crowd of lawless men? "Yes," says he, "but in doing this, I am not confusing my discourse, but going on in regular order." For as when discoursing about the unclean he made mention of all together; so again, on mentioning the covetous he brings forward all, thus making his rebukes familiar to those who have such things on their conscience. For the continual mention of the punishment laid up for others makes the reproof easy to be received, when it comes into conflict with our own sins. And so in the present instance he utters his threat, being spoken indefinitely and so wounding his conscience secretly.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 8.


{1 Cor 6:9-10; Ps 50:21}
"Be not deceived." Here he glances at certain who maintain (what indeed most men assert now) that God being good and kind to man, takes not vengeance upon our misdeeds: "Let us not then be afraid. For never will he exact justice of anyone for anything." And it is on account of these that he says, "Be not deceived." For it belongs to the extreme of error and delusion, after depending on good to meet with the contrary; and to surmise such things about God as even in man no one would think of. Wherefore says the Prophet in His person, (Psalm 49:LXX. 1. Hebrews ver. 21.) "You have conceived iniquity, that I shall be like to you: I will reprove you and set before your face your iniquities." And Paul here, "Be not deceived; neither fornicators," (he puts first the one that was already condemned,) "nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor drunkards, nor revilers, shall inherit the kingdom of God."

{1 Cor 6:9-10}
Many have attacked this place as extremely severe, since he places the drunkard and the reviler with the adulterer and the abominable and the abuser of himself with mankind. And yet the offenses are not equal: how then is the award of punishment the same? What shall we say then? First, that drunkenness is no small thing; Nor reviling, seeing that Christ Himself delivered over to hell him that called his brother fool. And often that sin has brought forth death. Again, the Jewish people too committed the greatest of their sins through drunkenness. In the next place, it is not of punishment that he is so far discoursing, but of exclusion from the kingdom. Now from the kingdom both one and the other are equally thrust out; but whether in hell they will find any difference, it belongs not to this present occasion to inquire.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 8.

{1 Cor 6:11}
[9.] Verse 11. "And such were some of you: but you were washed, but you were sanctified."
In a way to abash them exceedingly, he adds this: as if he said, "Consider from what evils God delivered us; how great an experiment and demonstration of loving-kindness He afforded us! He did not limit His redemption to mere deliverance, but greatly extended the benefit: for He also made you clean. Was this then all? Nay: but He also "sanctified." Nor even is this all: He also "justified." Yet even bare deliverance from our sins were a great gift: but now He also filled you with countless blessing. And this He has done, "In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;" not in this name or in that: yea also, "In the Spirit of our God."
Knowing therefore these things, beloved, and bearing in mind the greatness of the blessing which has been wrought, let us both continue to live soberly, being pure from all things that have been enumerated.

{1 Cor 6:11; Mt 5:40; Mt 5:25}
And let us avoid the tribunals which are in the forums of the Gentiles; and the noble birth which God has freely given us, the same let us preserve to the end. For think how full of shame it is that a Greek should take his seat and deal out justice to you. But you will say, what if he that is within judge contrary to the law? Why should he? tell me. For I would know by what kind of laws the Greek administers justice, and by what the Christian? Is it not quite plain that the laws of men are the rule of the Greek, but those of God, of the Christian? Surely then with the latter there is greater chance of justice. ... For in regard to those without, besides what has been said, there are many other things also to suspect; talent in speakers and corruption in magistrates and many other things which are the ruin of justice. ... "But what if he acquiesce not, but both despise those within and forcibly drag the course without?" Better were it to submit willingly to what you are likely to endure by compulsion, and not go to law, that you may have also a reward. For, (Matthew 5:40.) "If anyone will go to law with you, and take away your coat, you shall let him have your cloak also:" and, (v. 25.) "Agree with your adversary quickly, whilst you are with him in the way." And why need I speak of our rules? For even the pleaders in the heathen courts very often tell us this, saying, "it were better to make up matters out of court."
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 9.

{1 Cor 6:11; Mt 5:40}
[10.] Now then, if you commit injustice, it is plain that you cannot be righteous: but if you are injured and bear it, (for this is a special mark of a righteous man,) you have no need of the laws which are without. "How then," say you, "shall I be able to bear it when injured?" And yet Christ has commanded something even more than this. For not only has he commanded you when injured to bear it, but even to give abundantly more to the wrong-doer; and in your zeal for suffering ill to surpass his eagerness for doing it. For he said not, "to him that will sue you at law, and take away your coat, give your coat," but, "together with that give also your cloak." ...
And to shew that this is true; tell me, which conquered at the dunghill? Which was defeated? Job who was stripped of all, or the devil who stripped him of all? Evidently the devil who stripped him of all. Whom do we admire for the victory, the devil that smote, or Job that was smitten? Clearly, Job. And yet he could not retain his perishing wealth nor save his children. Why speak I of riches and children? He could not insure to himself bodily health. Yet nevertheless this is the conqueror, he that lost all that he had. His riches indeed he could not keep; but his piety he kept with all Strictness.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 10.

{1 Cor 6:11; Gal 6:7-8}
[11.] Knowing these things, therefore, let us of our free choice go on strict principles, and not be like the unwise, who think that they are then not wronged, when their suffering wrong is the result of a trial.
John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 11.


{1 Cor 6:12}
[1] "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought into the power of any.
HERE he glances at the gluttons. For since he intends to assail the fornicator again, and fornication arises from luxuriousness and want of moderation, he strongly chastises this passion. It cannot be that he speaks thus with regard to things forbidden, such not being "lawful:" but of things which seem to be indifferent. To illustrate my meaning: "It is lawful," he says, "to eat and to drink; but it is not beneficial with excess." ... And he signifies that to do what is in one's power not only is not beneficial, but even is not a part of power, but of slavery.
... This is his meaning: "You are at liberty to eat," says he; "well then, remain in liberty, and take heed that you do not become a slave to this appetite: for he who uses it properly, he is master of it; but he that exceeds the proper measure is no longer its master but its slave, since gluttony reigns paramount within him." Do you perceive how, where the man thought he had authority Paul points out that he is under authority? ... For mark; each of them was saying, "I have power to live luxuriously." He replies, "In doing so, you are not so much acting as one who had power over a thing, but rather as being thyself subject to some such power. For you have not power even over your own belly, so long as you are dissolute, but it has power over you." And the same we may say both of riches and of other things.
John Chrysostom, Homily 17 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 6:13; Phil 3:19}
Verse 13. "Foods for the belly."
By "the belly" here he means not the stomach, but the stomach's voraciousness. As when he says, (Philippians 3:19.) "Whose God is their belly:" not speaking about that part of the body, but about greediness. To prove that so it is, hear what follows: "And the belly for foods; but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord." And yet "the belly" also is of "the body." But he puts down two pairs of things, "foods" and gluttony, (which he terms "the belly;") "Christ," and "the body."
What then is the meaning of, "Foods for the belly?" "Foods," he says, are on good terms with gluttony, and it with them. It cannot therefore lead us to Christ, but drags towards these. For it is a strong and brutal passion, and makes us slaves, and puts us upon ministering to the belly. Why then are you excited and gaping after food, O man? For the end of that service is this, and nothing further shall be seen of it: but as one was waiting on some mistress, it abides keeping up this slavery, and advances no further, and has no other employment but this same fruitless one. And the two are connected together and destroyed together; "the belly" with "the foods," and "the foods" with "the belly;" winding out a sort of interminable course; .... But these things he says not concerning food and the body, but it is the passion of greediness and excess in eatables which he is censuring: and what follows shows it.
John Chrysostom, Homily 17 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 6:13; 1 Tim 6:8}
"But God shall bring to nought both it and them:" speaking not of the stomach, but of immoderate desire: not of food but of high feeding. For with the former he is not angry, but even lays down rules about them, saying, (1 Timothy 6:8.) "Having food and covering we shall be therewith content." However, thus he stigmatizes the whole thing; its amendment (after advice given) being left by him to prayer. But some say that the words are a prophecy, declaring the state which shall be in the life to come, and that there is no eating or drinking there. Now if that which is moderate shall have an end, much more ought we to abstain from excess.
John Chrysostom, Homily 17 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 6:13}
 "Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord;" for it was not formed for this purpose, to live riotously and commit fornication, as neither was the belly to be greedy; but that it might follow Christ as a Head, and that the Lord might be set over the body.
John Chrysostom, Homily 17 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 6:13-14}
[5.]  "But," says one, "had I not received a mortal body, I had not sinned." Tell me then, had he a mortal body when he sinned? Surely not: for if it had been mortal before, it would not have undergone death as a punishment afterwards. And that a mortal body is no hindrance to virtue, but that it keeps men in order and is of the great service, is plain from what follows. If the expectation of immortality alone so lifted up Adam; had he been even immortal in reality, to what a pitch of arrogance would he not have proceeded? And as things are, after sinning you may do away with your sins, the body being abject, falling away, and subject to dissolution: for these thoughts are sufficient to sober a man. But if you had sinned in an immortal body, your sins were likely to have been more lasting.
Mortality then is not the cause of sin: accuse it not: but the wicked will is the root of all the mischief. For why was not Abel at all the worse for his body? Why are the devils not at all the better for being incorporeal? Will you hear why the body's becoming mortal, so far from hurting, has been positively useful? Mark how much you gain thereby, if you are sober. It drags you back and pulls you off from wickedness, by griefs and pains and labors and other such things. "But it tempts men to uncleanness," perhaps you will say. Not the body, but incontinence, does this.
John Chrysostom, Homily 17 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 5.


{1 Cor 6:15}
[1] 6:15: "Know you not that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.
HAVING passed on from the fornicator to the covetous person, he comes back to the former from the latter, no longer henceforth discoursing with him but with the others who had not committed fornication. ... For he that has committed sin, though you direct your words to another, is stung even in that way; his conscience being thoroughly awakened and scourging him.
... "Know you not that your bodies are members of Christ?" thenceforth speaking as to children of noble birth. For whereas he had said, "Now the body is for the Lord," he indicates it more plainly now. ... But here he has employed it to startle and fill them with alarm. "Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid." Nothing can be more apt to strike horror than this expression. He said not, "Shall I take the members of Christ, and join them on to a harlot?" but what? "make them members of a harlot;" which surely would strike more keenly. Then he makes out how the fornicator becomes this, saying thus, "Know you not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body?" How is this evident? "For the twain, says He, shall become one."
John Chrysostom, Homily 18 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 1.

{1 Cor 6:18}
[2.] Verse 18. "Flee fornication."
He said not, "abstain from fornication," but "Flee:" that is, with all zeal make to yourselves deliverance from that evil. "Every sin that a man dos is without the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body." ... "What then," say you, "does not the murderer stain his hand? What, of the covetous person and the extortioner?" I suppose it is plain to everyone. But since it was not possible to mention anything worse than the fornicator, he amplifies the crime in another way, by saying that in the fornicator the entire body becomes defiled. For it is as polluted as if it had fallen into a vessel of filth, and been immersed in defilement. And this too is our way. For from covetousness and extortion no one would make haste to go into a bath, but as if nothing had happened returns to his house. Whereas from intercourse with a harlot, as having become altogether unclean, he goes to a bath. To such a degree does the conscience retain from this sin a kind of sense of unusual shame.
John Chrysostom, Homily 18 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 2.

{1 Cor 6:19}
[3.] Verse 19. "Know you not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you?"
He did not merely say, "of the Spirit," but, "which is in you;" which was the part of one who also was soothing. And again, explaining himself still further, he added, "which you have from God." ... "And you are not you own." This is not only to abash, but even to force men towards virtue. "For why," says he; "do you what you will? you are not your own master." But these things he said, not to take away free-will. For so in saying, "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial," he does not take away our liberty. And here again, writing, "You are not your own;" he makes no infringement upon freedom of choice, but he leads away from vice.
John Chrysostom, Homily 18 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 3.

{1 Cor 6:20}
"You were bought with a price."
Why say you this? Surely on another ground, one might say perhaps, you should have persuaded men, pointing out that "we have a Master." But this is common to the Greeks also together with us: whereas the expression, "You were bought with a price," belongs to us peculiarly. For he reminds us of the greatness of the benefit and of the mode of our salvation, signifying that when we were alienated, we were "bought:" and not simply "bought," but, "with a price." ... "You are members of Christ," says he, "you are a temple of the Spirit." Become not then "members of a harlot:" for it is not your body which is insulted; since it is not your body at all, but Christ's. And these things he spoke, both to make manifests His loving-kindness in that our body is His, and to withdraw us from all evil license. For if the body be another's, "you have no authority," says he, "to insult another's body; and especially when it is the Lord's; nor yet to pollute a temple of the Spirit." For if anyone who invades a private house and makes his way reveling into it, must answer for it most severely; think what dreadful things he shall endure who makes a temple of the King a robber's lurking place.
...
For supposing you had a daughter, and in extreme madness had let her out to a procurer for hire, and made her live a harlot's life, and then a king's son were to pass by, and free her from that slavery, and join her in marriage to himself; you could have no power thenceforth to bring her into the brothel. For you gave her up once for all, and sold her. Such as this is our case also. We let out our own flesh for hire to the Devil, that grievous procurer: Christ saw and set it free, and withdrew it from that evil tyranny; it is not then ours any more but His who delivered it. If you be willing to use it as a King's bride, there is none to hinder; but if you bring it where it was before, you will suffer just what they ought who are guilty of such outrages.

[4.] Wherefore he says, "He that is joined to a harlot is one body; but he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit." For such a one becomes thenceforth spirit, although a body envelope him. For when nothing corporeal nor gross nor earthly is around him, the body does but merely envelope him; since the whole government of him is in the soul and the Spirit.
    John Chrysostom, Homily 18 on 1 Corinthians, Sec. 4.
{Barnabas}
I then, not as your teacher, but as one of yourselves, will set forth a few things by which in present circumstances ye may be rendered the more joyful.    Barnabas 4913

{Isa 1:14; Ps 51:17}
Incense is a vain abomination unto Me, and your new moons and sabbaths I cannot endure."  He has therefore abolished these things, that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of necessity, might have a human oblation.    ... To us, then, He declares, "A sacrifice [pleasing] to God is a broken spirit; a smell of sweet savour to the Lord is a heart that glorifieth Him that made it."    Barnabas 4927
Barnabas, ch. 2

{1 Cor 10:12; Eternal Security}

{Heb 10:25}
Do not, by retiring apart, live a solitary life, as if you were already [fully] justified; but coming together in one place, make common inquiry concerning what tends to your general welfare.    Barnabas 4962

For to this end the Lord endured to deliver up His flesh to corruption, that we might be sanctified through the remission of sins, which is effected by His blood of sprinkling.   Barnabas 4972

{Lk 5:8}
But when He chose His own apostles who were to preach His Gospel, [He did so from among those] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came "not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."    Barnabas 4984
Barnabas, ch. 5

What, then, mean milk and honey? This, that as the infant is kept alive first by honey, and then by milk, so also we, being quickened and kept alive by the faith of the promise and by the word, shall live ruling over the earth.    Barnabas 5020

{Lev 16:7-10}
take one as a burnt-offering for sins. And what should they do with the other? "Accursed," says He, "is the one." Mark how the type of Jesus now comes out. "And all of you spit upon it, and pierce it, and encircle its head with scarlet wool, and thus let it be driven into the wilderness."
...
 And when all this has been done, he who bears the goat brings it into the desert, and takes the wool off from it, and places that upon a shrub which is called Rachia, of which also we are accustomed to eat the fruits when we find them in the field. Of this kind of shrub alone the fruits are sweet. Why then, again, is this? Give good heed. [You see] "one upon the altar, and the other accursed;" and why [do you behold] the one that is accursed crowned?    Barnabas 5036

{Num 19:2-6}
Israel, that men of the greatest wickedness should offer a heifer, and slay and burn it, and, that then boys should take the ashes, and put these into vessels, and bind round a stick purple wool along with hyssop, and that thus the boys should sprinkle the people, one by one, in order that they might be purified from their sins? Consider how He speaks to you with simplicity. The calf is Jesus: the sinful men offering it are those who led Him to the slaughter. But now the men are no longer guilty, are no longer regarded as sinners. And the boys that sprinkle are those that have proclaimed to us the remission of sins and purification of heart.    Barnabas 5050
Barnabas, ch. 8

{Num 19:6}
But why was hyssop joined with the wool? Because in His kingdom the days will be evil and polluted in which we shall be saved, [and] because he who suffers in body is cured through the cleansing efficacy of hyssop.    Barnabas 5057

{Deut 10:16; Circumcision}
But thou wilt say, "Yea, verily the people are circumcised for a seal." But so also is every Syrian and Arab, and all the priests of idols: are these then also within the bond of His covenant?    Barnabas 5070
. . .
Yea, the Egyptians also practise circumcision.    Barnabas 5072
Barnabas, ch. 9

{Gen 17:23}
"And Abraham circumcised ten, and eight, and three hundred men of his household." The ten and the eight are thus denoted-Ten by I, and Eight by E. You have [the initials of the, name of] Jesus. And because the cross was to express the grace [of our redemption] by the letter T, he says also, "Three Hundred." He signifies, therefore, Jesus by two letters, and the cross by one.    Barnabas 5075
Barnabas, ch. 9

{Lev 11:7-16; Deut 14:8-15}
"Thou shalt not eat the swine, nor the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed of scales?" ... Is there then not a command of God they should not eat [these things]? There is, but Moses spoke with a spiritual reference. For this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, "Thou shalt not join thyself to men who resemble swine." For when they live in pleasure, they forget their Lord;    Barnabas 5080, 5082
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:13-16; Deut 14:7-15}
"The eagle, nor the hawk, nor the kite, nor the raven." ... "Thou shalt not join thyself," he means, "to such men as know not how to procure food for themselves by labour and sweat, but seize on that of others in their iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder others."    Barnabas 5086
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:9-12; Deut 14:9-10}
"And thou shalt not eat," he says, "the lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttlefish." ...In like manner as those fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the rest, but make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom.    Barnabas 5090
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:6; Deut 14:7}
"Thou shall not," he says, "eat the hare." ... Wherefore? "Thou shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto such." Because the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception;    Barnabas 5092
...
Moreover, "Thou shall not eat the hyena." He means, "Thou shall not be an adulterer, nor a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such." Wherefore? Because that animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel.    Barnabas 5093
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:3}
"Ye shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant." What does he mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food, recognizes Him that nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him, is visibly made glad.    Barnabas 5102
. . .
meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate upon the word of the Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state [to come]. Behold how well Moses legislated.    Barnabas 5105
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Jer 2:13; Acts 2:38}
Concerning the water, indeed, it is written, in reference to the Israelites, that they should not receive that baptism which leads to the remission of sins, but should procure another for themselves.    Barnabas 5111
. . .
because this people hath committed two great evils: they have forsaken Me, a living fountain, and have hewn out for themselves broken cisterns.    Barnabas 5113
Barnabas, ch. 11

{Isa 33:16-17; Acts 2:38}
Furthermore, what saith He in reference to the Son? "His water is sure; ye shall see the King in His glory, and your soul shall meditate on the fear of the Lord."
   Barnabas 5117
. . .
Mark how He has described at once both the water and the cross. For these words imply, Blessed are they who, placing their trust in the cross, have gone down into the water; for, says He, they shall receive their reward in due time: then He declares, I will recompense them.   Barnabas 5122
Barnabas, ch. 11

{Ezek 47:12; Acts 2:38; 1 Pet 3:21}
"And there was a river flowing on the right, and from it arose beautiful trees; and whosoever shall eat of them shall live forever." This meaneth, that we indeed descend into the water full of sins and defilement, but come up, bearing fruit in our heart, having the fear [of God] and trust in Jesus in our spirit.    Barnabas 5126
Barnabas, ch. 11

{Gen 25:23}
"but the elder shall serve the younger: yet he also shall be blessed." ... But let us see if this people [the Gentiles] is the heir, or the former [the Jews], and if the testament belongs to us or to them. Hear what the Scripture says concerning the people. Isaac prayed for Rebecca his wife because she was barren; and she conceived. Furthermore also, Rebeca went forth to inquire of the Lord; and the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two people in your belly; and the one people shall surpass the other, and the elder shall serve the younger."
Barnabas, ch. 13

{Gen 48:19}
And in another prophecy Jacob speaks more clearly to his son Joseph, saying, . . .And he brought Manasseh and Ephraim, desiring that Manasseh should be blessed, because he was the elder. With this view Joseph led him to the right hand of his father Jacob. But Jacob saw in spirit the type of the people to arise afterwards. And Jacob saw in spirit the type of the people to arise afterwards. And what says [the Scripture]? And Jacob changed the direction of his hands, and laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, the second and younger, and blessed him. . ..
Ye see on whom he laid [his hands], that this people should be first, and heir of the covenant.
Barnabas, ch. 13

{Gen 15:6; Gen 17:5,6}
If then, still further, the same thing was intimated through Abraham, we reach the perfection of our knowledge. What, then, says He to Abraham? "Because thou hast believed, it is imputed to thee for righteousness: behold, I have made thee the father of those nations who believe in the Lord while in [a state of] uncircumcision."    Barnabas 5165
Barnabas, ch. 13

{Gen 1:31; Gen 2:1,2; 2 Pet 3:8}

{Gen 2:2,3}

Barnabas, ch. 15

{Isa 1:13; Eighth Day; Lk 24:1; Jn 20:1; Acts 20:7; Sabbath}
Your present Sabbaths are not acceptable to Me, but that is which I have made, [namely this,] when, giving rest to all things, I shall make a beginning of the eighth day, that is, a beginning of another world. Wherefore, also, we keep the eighth day with joyfulness, the day also on which Jesus rose again from the dead.    Barnabas 5201

{Mt 7:13,14}
There are two ways of doctrine and authority, the one of light, and the other of darkness.   Barnabas 5230

{Ex 21:22-25; Abortion}
"If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman's husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.23 But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life,24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

Do not be ready to stretch forth thy hands to take, whilst thou contractest them to give.    Barnabas 5252
. . .
Thou shalt love, as the apple of thine eye, every one that speaketh to thee the word of the Lord. Thou shalt remember the day of judgment, night and day. Thou shalt seek out every day the faces of the saints, either by word examining them, and going to exhort them, and meditating how to save a soul by the word, or by thy hands thou shalt labour for the redemption of thy sins. Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest. "Give to every one that asketh thee," and thou shalt know who is the good Recompenser of the reward. Thou shalt preserve what thou hast received [in charge], neither adding to it nor taking from it.    Barnabas 5252

{Mt 5:42; Jas 5:1-6}
"Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away." ... who turn away him that is in want, who oppress the afflicted, who are advocates of the rich, who are unjust judges of the poor, and who are in every respect transgressors.    Barnabas 5267

{Rev 20:12-13; Rom 2:6-11}
It is well, therefore, that he who has learned the judgments of the Lord, as many as have been written, should walk in them.

On this account there will be a resurrection, on this account a retribution.    Barnabas 5269

{Jn 1:18}
the evangelist John sufficiently shows, when he thus writes concerning Him: "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father." For since that divine teacher intended to show that the Father and the Son are two things inseparable the one from the other, he spoke of Him as being in the bosom of the Father.    location 116452

Alexander of Alexandria, Letters on the Arian Heresy, Letter I.

{Jn 1:18}
the most pious John contemplated the essence of the divine Word at a very great distance, and as placed beyond all conception of those things that are begotten, he thought it not meet to speak of His generation and creation; not daring to designate the Creator in the same terms as the things that are made. Not that the Word is unbegotten, for the Father alone is unbegotten, but because the inexplicable subsistence of the only-begotten Son transcends the acute comprehension of the evangelists, and perhaps also of angels.    location 116463

{Prov 8:30 [LXX]}
it is necessary to say that the Father is always the Father. But He is the Father, since the Son is always with Him, on account of whom He is called the Father. Wherefore, since the Son is always with Him, the Father is always perfect, being destitute of nothing as regards good; who, not in time, nor after an interval, nor from things which are not, hath begotten His only-begotten Son. How, then, is it not impious to say, that the wisdom of God once was not which speaks thus concerning itself: "I was with Him forming all things; I was His delight;"    location 116488

Alexander of Alexandria, Letters on the Arian Heresy, Letter I.

{Jn 10:30; Jn 14:8-9}
words which signify His natural glory and nobility, and abiding with the Father, they have become unmindful. Such as this: "I and My Father are one," which indeed the Lord says, not as proclaiming Himself to be the Father, nor to demonstrate that two persons are one; but that the Son of the Father most exactly preserves the expressed likeness of the Father, inasmuch as He has by nature impressed upon Him His similitude in every respect, and is the image of the Father in no way discrepant, and the expressed figure of the primitive exemplar. Whence, also, to Philip, who then was desirous to see Him, the Lord shows this abundantly. For when he said, "Show us the Father," He answered: "He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father," since the Father was Himself seen through the spotless and living mirror of the divine image.    location 116528

For they [the Arians] ignorantly affirm that one of two things must necessarily be said, either that He is from things which are not, or that there are two unbegottens; nor do those ignorant men know how great is the difference between the unbegotten Father, and the things which were by Him created from things which are not, as well the rational as the irrational. Between which two, as holding the middle place, the only begotten nature of God, the Word by which the Father formed all things out of nothing, was begotten of the true Father Himself. As in a certain place the Lord Himself testified, saying, "Every one that loveth Him that begat, loveth Him also that is begotten of Him."    location 116549

12. Concerning whom we thus believe, even as the Apostolic Church believes. In one Father unbegotten, who has from no one the cause of His being, who is unchangeable and immutable, who is always the same, and admits of no increase or diminution; who gave to us the Law, the prophets, and the Gospels; who is Lord of the patriarchs and apostles, and all the saints. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God; not begotten of things which are not, but of Him who is the Father; not in a corporeal manner, by excision or division as Sabellius and Valentinus thought, but in a certain inexplicable and unspeakable manner, according to the words of the prophet cited above: "Who shall declare His generation?" Since that His subsistence no nature which is begotten can investigate, even as the Father can be investigated by none; because that the nature of rational beings cannot receive the knowledge of His divine generation by the Father.    location 116554

So also they erred who believed that the sun is a god. For we see that it is moved by the compulsion of another, and revolves and makes its journey, and proceeds from sign to sign, rising and setting every day, so as to give warmth for the growth of plants and trees, and to bring forth into the air where with it (sunlight) is mingled every growing thing which is upon the earth. And to it there belongs by comparison a part in common with the rest of the stars in its course;  ... and that not according to its own will but rather according to the will of him who rules it.

 the fallacy of this is very clearly shown, from the fact that, although all human beings who die rise again, yet not all who rise again are to be judged: for if only a just judgment were the cause of the resurrection, it would of course follow that those who had done neither evil nor good-namely, very young children-would not rise again; but seeing that all are to rise again, those who have died in infancy as well as others, they too justify our conclusion that the resurrection takes place not for the sake of the judgment as the primary reason, but in consequence of the purpose of God in forming men, and the nature of the beings so formed.   location 25095

If this is evident, and natural and artificial powers, and the actions arising from these, must by all means be accompanied by an end in accordance with nature, it is absolutely necessary that the end of men, since it is that of a peculiar nature, should be separated from community with the rest; for it is not lawful to suppose the same end for beings destitute of rational judgment, and of those whose actions are regulated by the innate law and reason, and who live an intelligent life and observe justice.   location 25298

And we shall make no mistake in saying, that the final cause of an intelligent life and rational judgment, is to be occupied uninterruptedly with those objects to which the natural reason is chiefly and primarily adapted, and to delight unceasingly in the contemplation of Him who is, and of His decrees, notwithstanding that the majority of men, because they are affected too passionately and too violently by things below, pass through life without attaining this object.

And if he speaks of a Bishop being the husband of one wife, and having his children in subjection [1 Timothy 3:2-4], this is not said, as if it were necessary he should have a wife and children; but that if any should happen from a secular life to be advanced to that office, they might be such as knew how to preside over their household and children, and all others committed to them.    location 58447

Ver. 3. As I besought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia.  Paul had himself passed some time in that city. There was the temple of Diana, and there he had been exposed to those great sufferings. For after the assembly in the Theater had been dissolved, and he had called to him and exhorted the disciples, he found it necessary to sail away, though afterwards he returned to them. It were worth enquiry, whether he stationed Timothy there at that time.    location 58511

"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe in Him to life everlasting." ... And this was visibly the situation of Paul, for he makes himself the example. Nor is he ashamed to call himself a sinner, but rather delights in it, as he thus can best demonstrate the miracle of God's regard for him, and that He had thought him worthy of such extraordinary kindness. But how is it, that he here calls himself a sinner, nay, the chief of sinners, whereas he elsewhere asserts that he was touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless? [Philippians 3:6] Because with respect to the righteousness which God has wrought, the justification which is really sought, even those who are righteous in the law are sinners, for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

Then indeed the women, from such teaching, kept silence; but now there is apt to be great noise among them, much clamor and talking, and nowhere so much as in this place. They may all be seen here talking more than in the market, or at the bath. For, as if they came hither for recreation, they are all engaged in conversing upon unprofitable subjects. Thus all is confusion, and they seem not to understand, that unless they are quiet, they cannot learn anything that is useful. For when our discourse strains against the talking, and no one minds what is said, what good can it do to them? To such a degree should women be silent, that they are not allowed to speak not only about worldly matters, but not even about spiritual things, in the church.    location 59361

For thus they will show submission by their silence. For the sex is naturally somewhat talkative: and for this reason he restrains them on all sides. For Adam, says he, was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. If it be asked, what has this to do with women of the present day? It shows that the male sex enjoyed the higher honor. Man was first formed; and elsewhere he shows their superiority. Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man. [1 Corinthians 11:9] Why then does he say this? He wishes the man to have the preeminence in every way; both for the reason given above, he means, let him have precedence, and on account of what occurred afterwards. For the woman taught the man once, and made him guilty of disobedience, and wrought our ruin. Therefore because she made a bad use of her power over the man, or rather her equality with him, God made her subject to her husband. Your desire shall be to your husband? [Genesis 3:16] This had not been said to her before.    location 59369
John Chrysostom, Homily 9 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 2:14}
But how was Adam not deceived? If he was not deceived, he did not then transgress? Attend carefully. The woman said, The serpent beguiled me. But the man did not say, The woman deceived me, but, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. Now it is not the same thing to be deceived by a fellow-creature, one of the same kind, as by an inferior and subordinate animal. This is truly to be deceived. Compared therefore with the woman, he is spoken of as not deceived. For she was beguiled by an inferior and subject, he by an equal. Again, it is not said of the man, that he saw the tree was good for food, but of the woman, and that she did eat, and gave it to her husband: so that he transgressed, not captivated by appetite, but merely from the persuasion of his wife. The woman taught once, and ruined all. On this account therefore he says, let her not teach.    location 59377
John Chrysostom, Homily 9 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 2:14; Rom 5:14}
But what is it to other women, that she suffered this? It certainly concerns them; for the sex is weak and fickle, and he is speaking of the sex collectively. For he says not Eve, but the woman, which is the common name of the whole sex, not her proper name. Was then the whole sex included in the transgression for her fault? As he said of Adam, After the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to come [Romans 5:14]; so here the female sex transgressed, and not the male.    location 59383

{1 Tim 2:15}
Shall not women then be saved? Yes, by means of children. For it is not of Eve that he says, If they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. What faith? What charity? What holiness with sobriety? It is as if he had said, You women, be not cast down, because your sex has incurred blame. God has granted you another opportunity of salvation, by the bringing up of children, so that you are saved, not only by yourselves, but by others.    location 59386
John Chrysostom, Homily 9 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 2:15}
Yes, it was, still Eve transgressed, but the whole sex shall be saved, notwithstanding, by childbearing. And why not by their own personal virtue? For has she excluded others from this salvation? And what will be the case with virgins, with the barren, with widows who have lost their husbands, before they had children? will they perish? Is there no hope for them? Yet virgins are held in the highest estimation. What then does he mean to say? Some interpret his meaning thus. As what happened to the first woman occasioned the subjection of the whole sex, (for since Eve was formed second and made subject, he says, let the rest of the sex be in subjection,) so because she transgressed, the rest of the sex are also in transgression. But this is not fair reasoning; for at the creation all was the gift of God, but in this case, it is the consequence of the woman's sin. But this is the amount of what he says. As all men died through one, because that one sinned, so the whole female race transgressed, because the woman was in the transgression. Let her not however grieve. God has given her no small consolation, that of childbearing. And if it be said that this is of nature, so is that also of nature; for not only that which is of nature has been granted, but also the bringing up of children. If they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety; that is, if after childbearing, they keep them in charity and purity. By these means they will have no small reward on their account, because they have trained up wrestlers for the service of Christ.    location 59391

and for the same reason perhaps he said, the husband of one wife, though elsewhere he says, I would that all men were even as I myself! [1 Corinthians 7:7], that is, practicing continency.

And here he requires, though in other words, that he be not a novice, where he says, Let these also first be proved, where the conjunction also is added, as connecting this with what had been said before of Bishops, for nothing intervenes between. And there is the same reason for the not a novice in that case. For would it not be absurd, that when a newly purchased slave is not entrusted with anything in a house, till he has by long trial given proofs of his character, yet that one should enter into the Church of God from a state of heathenism, and be at once placed in a station of preeminence?

The discretion of the blessed Paul is observable. When he would exhort the Deacons to avoid excess in wine, he does not say, Be not drunken, but not even given to much wine. A proper caution; for if those who served in the Temple did not taste wine at all, much more should not these. For wine produces disorder of mind, and where it does not cause drunkenness, it destroys the energies and relaxes the firmness of the soul.

Marvel not, he says, if some having departed from the faith still adhere to Judaism. There will be a time, when even those who have partaken of the faith will fall into a worse error, not only with respect to meats, but to marriages, and other such things, introducing the most pernicious notions. This refers not to the Jews, (for the latter times, and a departure from the faith, is not applicable to them;) but to the Manichees, and the founders of these sects.

But is not luxury forbidden? Certainly it is. But why? If good things are created to be received. Because He created bread, and yet too much is forbidden; and wine also, and yet excess is forbidden; and we are not commanded to avoid dainties as if they were unclean in themselves, but as they corrupt the soul by excess.

therefore he lays down two positions: first, that no creature of God is unclean: secondly, that if it had become so, you have a remedy, seal it, give thanks, and glorify God, and all the uncleanness passes away. Can we then so cleanse that which is offered to an idol? If you know not that it was so offered. But if, knowing this, you partake of it, you will be unclean; not because it was offered to an idol, but because contrary to an express command, you thereby communicate with devils. So that it is not unclean by nature, but becomes so through your wilful disobedience. What then, is not swine's flesh unclean? By no means, when it is received with thanksgiving,   Location: 59,706 John Chrysostom, Homily 12 on First Timothy

being nourished up, he says, meaning to imply constancy in application to these things. For as we set before us day by day this bodily nourishment, so he means, let us be continually receiving discourses concerning the faith, and ever be nourished with them. What is this, being nourished up? Ruminating upon them; attending ever to the same things, and practicing ever the same, for it is no common nourishment that they supply.

And what was the object of the prohibition of so many meats? To restrain excessive luxury. But had it been said, eat not for the sake of luxury, it would not have been borne. They were therefore shut up under the necessity of the law, that they might abstain from the stronger principle of fear. The fish was not forbidden, though it was manifestly more unclean than the swine. But they might have learned how pernicious luxury was from that saying of Moses, Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked. [Deuteronomy 32:15] Another cause of these prohibitions might be, that being straitened for other food, they might be reduced to slaughter sheep and oxen; he therefore restrained them from other things, on account of Apis and the calf, which was an abomination, ungrateful, polluted, and profane.

but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. And why, says one, does he mention this bodily exercise? To show by comparison the superiority of the other, in that the former is of no solid advantage, though it is attended with many toils, while the latter has a lasting and abundant good. As when he bids women adorn themselves, not with broidered hair, or gold, or costly array: but which becomes women possessing godliness; with good works.

For instance, it is not proper to teach a man not to be wicked, but to command; to forbid it with all authority.

For these things are not said to Timothy only, but to all. And if such advice is addressed to him, who raised the dead, what shall be said to us? Christ also shows the duty of teachers, when He says, The kingdom of heaven is like an householder, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.

{1 Tim 5:3-7}
For a woman may have lost her husband, and yet not be truly a widow. As in order to be a virgin, it is not enough to be a stranger to marriage, but many other things are necessary, as blamelessness and perseverance; so the loss of a husband does not constitute a widow, but patience, with chastity and separation from all men. Such widows he justly bids us honor, or rather support. For they need support, being left desolate, and having no husband to stand up for them.

Ver. 5. Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. She who being a widow has not made choice of a worldly life, is a widow indeed; she who trusts in God as she ought, and continues instant in prayer night and day, is a widow indeed. Not that she, who has children, is not a widow indeed. For he commends her who brings up children as she ought. But if any one has not children, he means, she is desolate, and her he consoles, saying, that she is most truly a widow, who has lost not only the consolation of a husband, but that arising from children, yet she has God in the place of all.

The living perform the works of life, of that future life, which is truly life. And Christ has declared what are the works of that future life, with which we ought always to be occupied. Come, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink.

{1 Tim 5:8}
Many consider that their own virtue is sufficient for their salvation, and if they duly regulate their own life, that nothing further is wanting to save them. But in this they greatly err, which is proved by the example of him who buried his one talent, for he brought it back not diminished but entire, and just as it had been delivered to him. It is shown also by the blessed Paul, who says here, If any one provide not for his own. The provision of which he speaks is universal, and relates to the soul as well as the body, since both are to be provided for.   Location: 59,968 John Chrysostom, Homily 14 on First Timothy

And so says Isaiah, the chief of the Prophets, You shall not overlook your kinsmen of your own seed.

Hide not yourself from your own flesh. [Isaiah 58:7] How does he then believe who thus denies God? Let those consider this, who to spare their wealth neglect their kindred. It was the design of God, in uniting us by the ties of kindred, to afford us many opportunities of doing good to one another. When therefore you neglect a duty which infidels perform, have you not denied the faith?   Location: 59,981 John Chrysostom, Homily 14 on First Timothy

For since he had spoken of luxury and self-indulgence, he says that it is not for this only that such a woman is punished, because she is luxurious, but because her luxury compels her to neglect her household. This he says with reason; for she that lives to the belly, perishes hereby also, as having denied the faith. But how is she worse than an infidel? Because it is not the same thing to neglect our kindred, as to neglect a stranger. How should it be?

You see that it is not merely the not contracting a second marriage that is enough to make a widow, many other things are necessary. But why does he discourage second marriages? Is the thing condemned? By no means. That is heretical. Only he would have her henceforth occupied in spiritual things, transferring all her care to virtue. For marriage is not an impure state, but one of much occupation. He speaks of their having leisure, not of their being more pure by remaining unmarried. For marriage certainly implies much secular engagement.   Location: 60,012 John Chrysostom, Homily 14 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 5:10; Jn 13:14}
Observe, the hospitality here spoken of is not merely a friendly reception, but one given with zeal and alacrity, with readiness, and going about it as if one were receiving Christ Himself. The widows should perform these services themselves, not commit them to their handmaids. For Christ said, If I your Master and Lord have washed your feet, you ought also to wash one another's feet. [John 13:14] And though a woman may be very rich, and of the highest rank, vain of her birth and noble family, there is not the same distance between her and others, as between God and the disciples.

Abraham was receiving men that passed as travelers, as he thought, and he did not leave to his servants to make the preparations for their entertainment, but took the greater part of the service upon himself, and commanded his wife to mix the flour, though he had three hundred and eighteen servants born in his house, of whom there must have been many maidservants; but he wished that himself and his wife should have the reward, not of the cost only, but of the service.

proceeds now to say, But the younger widows refuse. But concerning virgins, though the case of their falling is a much more gross one, he has said nothing of this kind, and rightly. For they had enrolled themselves on higher views, and the work with them proceeded from a greater elevation of mind. Therefore the receiving of strangers, and the washing of the Saints' feet, he has represented by attending upon the Lord without distraction [1 Corinthians 7:34-35], and by saying, The unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord. [1 Corinthians 7:34-35] And if he has not limited a particular age for them, it is most likely because that point is settled by what he has said in this case. But indeed, as I said, the choice of virginity proceeded from a higher purpose.   Location: 60,160 John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 5:11-12; 1 Cor 7:34-35}
For that some had already fallen away is plain, in that he says, When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; and again, For some have already turned aside after Satan. The younger widows refuse, for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; that is, when they have become scornful and luxurious. For as in the case of a just man, we might say, Let her depart, for she has become another's. He shows therefore that though they chose widowhood, it was not the choice of their judgment. So then a widow, by the state of widowhood, is espoused to Christ.   Location: 60,165 John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on First Timothy

{2 Cor 11:2; 1 Tim 5:12-13}
Elsewhere indeed he says, I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. [2 Corinthians 11:2] After having given their names to Him, they will marry, he says, having condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith. By faith he means, fidelity to their covenant. As if he had said, They have been false to Christ, they have dishonored Him, and transgressed His covenant. And withal they learn to be idle. Thus he commands not only men, but women also, to work. For idleness is the teacher of every sin. And not only are they exposed to this condemnation, but to other sins. If therefore it is unbecoming for a married woman to go from house to house, much more is it for a virgin.   Location: 60,174 John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 5:13-15}
And nothing is so unbecoming to a woman, as to busy herself in the concerns of others, and it is no less unbecoming to a man. This is a great sign of impudence and forwardness. I will therefore, he says, (since they themselves wish it,) that the younger widows marry, bear children, guide the house. This course is at least preferable to the other. They ought indeed to be concerned for the things of God, they ought to preserve their faith. But since they do not this, it is better to avoid a worse course. God is not dishonored by their marrying again, and they do not fall into those practices, which have been censured. From such a widowhood, no good could arise, but good may come out of this marriage.   Location: 60,188 John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on First Timothy

Ver. 17, 18. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward. The honor of which he here speaks is attention to them, and the supply of their necessities, as is shown by his adding, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain [Deuteronomy 25:4]; and, The laborer is worthy of his reward. [Luke 10:7] So when he says, Honor widows, he means, support them in all that is necessary.   Location: 60,203 John Chrysostom, Homily 15 on First Timothy

{1 Tim 5:17-18}
The laborer, he says, is worthy of his reward. So that if any one lives in sloth and luxury, he is unworthy of it. Unless he is as the ox treading out the grain, and bearing the yoke, in spite of heat and thorns, and ceases not till he has carried the grain into the granary, he is not worthy. Therefore to teachers should be granted a supply of their necessities without grudging, that they may not faint nor be discouraged, nor by attention to inferior things deprive themselves of greater; that they may labor for spiritual things, paying no regard to worldly things.

Not upon a first, nor a second, nor a third trial, but after frequent and strict examination and circumspection. For it is an affair of no common peril. For you will be responsible for the sins committed by him, as well his past as his future sins, because you have delegated to him this power.

But why did not Paul restore strength to his stomach? Not because he could not- for he whose garment had raised the dead was clearly able to do this too-but because he had a design of importance in withholding such aid. What then was his purpose? That even now, if we see great and virtuous men afflicted with infirmities, we may not be offended, for this was a profitable visitation. If indeed to Paul himself a messenger of Satan was sent that he should not be exalted above measure [2 Corinthians 12:11], much more might it be so with Timothy. For the miracles he wrought were enough to have rendered him arrogant. For this reason he is left to be subject to the rules of medicine, that he may be humbled, and others may not be offended,   Location: 60,356  John Chrysostom, Homily 16 on First Timothy

"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their masters worthy of all honor, that the Name of God and His doctrine be not blasphemed." Let them count them worthy of all honor, he says; for do not suppose, because you are a believer, that you are therefore a free man: since your freedom is to serve the more faithfully. For if the unbeliever sees slaves conducting themselves insolently on account of their faith, he will blaspheme, as if the Doctrine produced insubordination. But when he sees them obedient, he will be more inclined to believe, and will the rather attend to our words.   Location: 60,373  John Chrysostom, Homily 16 on First Timothy

But the masters he recommends to forbear the use of terror. Forbearing threatening [Ephesians 6:9], he says. And why does he thus command? In the case of unbelievers, naturally, because it would have been unreasonable to address those who would pay no heed to him; but where believers were concerned, what was his reason? Because masters contribute greater benefits to their servants, than servants to their masters. For the former furnish the money to purchase for them sufficient food and clothing; and bestow much care upon them in other respects, so that the masters pay them the larger service, which is here intimated, when he says, they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. They suffer much toil and trouble for your repose, ought they not in return to receive much honor from their servants?   Location: 60,383 John Chrysostom, Homily 16 on First Timothy

But what is the expression, "severally?" "So far at least as appertaineth to you; and so far as naturally a part should be built up from you." For because he had said, "the body," whereas the whole body was not the Corinthian Church, but the Church in every part of the world, therefore he said, "severally:" i.e., the Church amongst you is a part of the Church existing every where and of the body which is made up of all the Churches: so that not only with yourselves alone, but also with the whole Church throughout the world, ye ought to be at peace,    location 398120

"Thirdly, teachers." For he that prophesies speaks all things from the Spirit; but he that teaches sometimes discourses also out of his own mind. Wherefore also he said, "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and in teaching:" (1 Tim. v. 17.) whereas he that speaks all things by the Spirit doth not labor.

For neither did he say, "a gift," but "a way," that he might the more extol that which he intends to mention.

Yea, rather consider how great a blessing it is of itself to exercise love; what cheerfulness it produces, in how great grace it establishes the soul.

For this cause therefore, as it were from one head, he bound together the whole body of the human race.

For, "therefore," saith He, "shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be for one flesh." (Gen. ii. 24) And he said not, "the woman," but, "the man," because the desire too is stronger in him.

Further, in order that the one might be subject, and the other rule; (for equality is wont oftentimes to bring in strife;) he suffered it not to be a democracy, but a monarchy; and as in an army, this order one may see in every family. In the rank of monarch, for instance, there is the husband; but in the rank of lieutenant and general, the wife; and the children too are allotted a third station in command. Then after these a fourth order, that of the servant. For these also bear rule over their inferiors, and some one of them is oftentimes set over the whole, keeping ever the post of the master, but still as a servant.

And accordingly that we might easily keep up intercourse with distant countries, He spread the level of the sea between us, and gave us the swiftness of winds, thereby making our voyages easy. And at the beginning He even gathered all men together in one spot, and did not disperse them until they who first received the gift abused their concord unto sin.

And from the beginning He made one sovereignty only, setting the man over the woman. But after that our race ran headlong into extreme disorder, He appointed other sovereignties also, those of masters, and those of governors, and this too for love's sake. That is, since vice was a thing apt to dissolve and subvert our race, He set those who administer justice in the midst of our cities as a kind of physicians, that driving away vice, as it were a plague to love, they might gather together all in one. And that not only in cities, but also in each family there might be great unanimity, He honored the man with rule and superiority; the woman on the other hand He armed with desire. And the gift also of procreation of children, He committed in common to both. ... He furnished also other things apt to conciliate love: neither entrusting all to the man, nor all to the woman; but "dividing these things also severally to each;" to her entrusting the house, and to him the market; to him the work of feeding, for he tills the ground; to her that of clothing, for loom and distaff are the woman's.

How then did this Patriarch overcome and subdue this monster, when he had a dispute with his nephew?

{Gen 18:1-8; Gen 24:2-4}
Again, Abraham entertained strangers, yet did he not here act vain-gloriously, but himself both ran to them and bowed down to them, not as though he were giving, but receiving a benefit, and he calleth them lords, without knowing who they are who are come to him, and presents his wife in the place of a handmaiden. ... And when he sent to betroth a wife for his son, he gave no command to speak in high and dignified terms of him, (Gen. xxiv.) but merely to bring the bride.    location 399122

{2 Cor 10:10; 2 Cor 13:7}
Consider, I pray, this same Apostle who speaks these things, how he ever ascribes the whole to God, how of his sins he makes mention continually, but of his good deeds never, unless perchance it should be needful to correct the disciples; and even if he be compelled to do this, he calls the matter folly, and yields the first place to Peter, and is not ashamed to labor with Priscilla and Aquila, and everywhere he is eager to show himself lowly. ... Wherefore also he said, "but his bodily presence is weak." (2 Cor. x. 10.) i.e., easy to be despised, and not at all accompanied with display. And again, "I pray that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved."    location 399128

{Phil 4:11-12; 1 Tim 6:9-10}
Knowing therefore these things, let us not shun poverty, let us not admire riches: but prepare our soul to be sufficient for all estates. ... For whom doth not the rich man fear? Are there not robbers, potentates, enviers, informers?  ... Now the accursed hands of the tomb-breakers do not even abstain from these, [the corpse of a rich man] but move and turn it about, and with much cruelty insult it. For after it hath been committed to the ground, having stripped it both of its covering of earth and of that which its grave-clothes constitute, they leave it thus to be cast out. ... So wealth even after death exacts a most bitter punishment, exposing them naked and unburied, a dreadful and pitiable spectacle: since even those who suffer this after sentence and by the anger of their judges, do not suffer so grievously as these. For they [criminals] indeed remain unburied the first and second day, and thereafter are committed to the ground; but these, when they have been committed to the ground, are then stripped naked and insulted.  ... Such is our enjoyment of wealth; to be insulted even after death, and deprived of sepulture which even the most desperate criminals obtain.    location 399185

{1 Jn 3:16-19; Jas 2:15-16}
when wealth is shut up and preserved, then it destroys its possessors and hoarders. But let us make this beast tame. And it will be tame, if we do not shut it up, but give it into the hands of all who are in need. So shall we reap from this quarter the greatest blessings,   location 399196
