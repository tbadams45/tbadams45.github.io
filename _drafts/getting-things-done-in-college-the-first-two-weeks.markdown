title: Getting Things Done in College - The First Two Weeks

The beginning of the semester is a fun time. It's relatively easy to walk around with a spring in their step; classes have only just started and dreams of how the semester will go often feel stronger than the reality of how last semester actually went.  

The tendency many freshman have (hey, college students in gneeral) is to ignore the rapidly approaching rush of homework, tests, projects, and papers, preferring instead to pretend that every day is as easy as the first day. This is not a good idea. Each semester is like a snowball rolling down the hill, and whether or not the direction it's going is the one you want depends on how you start the first two weeks.
