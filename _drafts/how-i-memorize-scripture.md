In my previous post, I wrote about [the reasons I memorize scripture]({% post_url 2020-11-08-why-memorize-scripture %}). Most people have had some experience with memorization, but it is often a frustrating process. I'd like to share a method with you that I've found produces much more effective results to help you memorize more in less time and with less frustration.

## What most people get wrong

What most people do when they try to memorize something is that they read it over and over again. They figure that if they read it enough then eventually they'll have it memorized. The problem with this is that reading something is quite a different activity from recalling it from memory. Reading and recalling are like two different muscle groups in your body. If you only worked out your arms for a month, you wouldn't expect to have strong legs. In the same way, if you only read a scripture when you're trying to memorize it, you'll find that your ability to recall it later from memory is only marginally improved. 

The solution to this is to employ a method that helps you practice recall from the very beginning. Whether you want to memorize one verse or an entire book of the Bible, the method is basically the same.

## The method

In just a few steps, the method is:

1. *Write* the first letter of every word on a piece of paper. Include punctuation and, ideally, any line breaks that are in the text. Let's call this document your "cheat sheet". When you're done, your cheat sheet will look something like this.

2. *Recall*: looking at your cheat sheet, try to recite 2-3 sentences of the scripture from memory. You won't be able to - that is OK! You are practicing recall. Allow yourself to get stuck and give yourself a few seconds to try to remember. When you know you won't remember, then go back to the passage and check where you had trouble. Repeat this process until you can confidently recite the scripture using only your cheat sheet and without checking the actual passage.
3. *Medidate*: Using your cheat sheet, meditate on the scripture. In this case, meditating means thinking deeply about the scripture. You can think about the meaning of the passage, about its structure, and on how the different parts of the passage build upon each other and work together. In 
4. Read the passage a dozen or so times, using just the first letters as your reference. Meditate on the meaning of the passage, on its structure, and on how the pieces play into the whole. The more you think about what it means the easier it will be to remember.
5. Take a break. Sleep on it.
6. Start trying to recite the passage from memory, without any prompts. It will be hard. That's ok. The method is to do as much as you can, and then once you get stuck to quickly review your first letters to see where you went wrong. This is the most important part though, because practicing recall is a very different thing than just reading, so you really want to try to not use your notes.
7. Once you've memorized it fully, use a tool like Anki to make spaced-based repetition flash cards so you never forget (optional step but very powerful)
