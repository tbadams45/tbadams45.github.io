It's been a long time since this newsletter has shown up in your inbox, so kudos to you for opening it! I'm hoping to get back into writing a bit more consistently, as there's been a lot going through my mind over the past couple of years. To make the writing and distribution process a bit easier, I'm moving to a new newsletter platform and website. You can find it here: [https://making-room.beehiiv.com/subscribe](https://making-room.beehiiv.com/subscribe). 

This particular newsletter will get shut down after this message, so if you want to keep on getting messages from me whenever I do end up posting, subscribe at the new site!
