A blog post on: what are you spending your time on? What are you pursuing?

> "How we spend our days is how we spend our lives." *Annie Dillard*

Some of the thoughts below might be segmented to a separate blog post.


# Elizabeth's thoughts

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
	People had lives for thousands before facebook. You can too!
	A sixth of the world is on Facebook. But the rest of them are doing fine. And probably have more fulfilled inner lives than you.
	Don't do drugs. Don't do facebook.
	Don't do internet drugs.
	You have 168 hours a week. If you work a 60 hour work week and sleep 7 hours a night (which no one does), you still have 60 hours a week to do whatever you want with your life.
	Don't say you don't have enough time. You do have enough time.
	If you spend your whole life on instagram, snapchat, etc. you'll have wasted your whole life.
	On your dying day: "I wish I had spent more time on Instagram" - said no one ever


Do you know how you're spending your days?

Tomorrow is not given to you. It's not promised. You have only today.

# A lesson on diligence and working for the Lord - stewards of God's grace

As christians, our lives should be spent 

1 Tim 4
2 Cor 5:9 ambition to please God
1 Peter 4 stewards of God's gifts/grace
Titus 3 on slaves, Col 3 on slaevs

Where can I have the most impact for the Kingdom?

# Life as stewardship

Love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength
Love your neighbor as yourself

Do everything as if working for the lord

Parable of the talents

God gave you the ability to make wealth (Deut 8)
