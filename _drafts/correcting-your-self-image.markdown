(see the "love your neighbor as" post, since that one includes some of this stuff)

> Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. *Leviticus 19:18*


> Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this quetsion: 'Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?' 
> Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your head and with all your soul and with all your mind. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.' *Matthew 22:34-40*

A friend of mine recently asked me if there were any scriptures that they could use to love themself. Referencing Jesus' command to "love your neighbor as yourself", they thought that the root of most of their harmful behavior to God, others, and themselves (read: sin) stemmed from their self-hatred/self-loathing. 

Thinking about self-image, self-hate, self-harm. 

The key point: **The correct self-image is the one that imitates the way God sees us.** Or, to put another way, we need to let the Bible influence the way we see ourselves.

Some thoughts:
1. Love your neighbor as yourself: not the epitome, but the baseline. The epitome, and the example to turn to if you don't feel like you love yourself, is the other command: as I have loved you, so you must love one another.
2. There are a number of examples of Godly men in the past who were initially hindered from being used by God because they let their own weaknesses dominate their thinking (e.g. Moses, Gideon). They needed to believe that God would use them as he said, and that he would be with them as he said he would.  (God being with them was the source of their strength, both times)
3. The people of Israel were reminded to remember God and the nature of their relationship to him lest they become prideful and fall into sin (cf. Deueteronomy) Most often, this is the problem - we have too high a view of ourselves. This can rise from false comparisons (cf. 2 Corinthians).
4. God describes who his people are, and how he cares for them (cf. Isaiah 40:11, 1 Peter 2, etc.). That description takes priority.
