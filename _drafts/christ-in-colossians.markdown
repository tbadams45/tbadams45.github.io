## Jesus in himself
God is the father of Jesus Christ
The kingdom of light that we're brought into is *his* kingdom.
He is the image of the invisible God
The firstborn over all creation
In him all things were created
All things have been created through him and for him
He is before all things
And in him all things hold together
He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
Christ is the mystery of God. 
In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
All the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form (in Christ)
He is the head over every power and authority
The powers and authorities were made a public spectacle, triumphing over them by the cross.
"The reality, however, is found in Christ." [not in what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a new moon celebration or a Sabbath day]
Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
"Christ is all, and is in all."
Pray that Paul "may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains."

## Paul's relationship to Jesus
Paul is an apostle of Christ Jesus
Paul fills up in his flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ' afflictions.
Paul uses the energy "Christ so powerfully works in me."

## Our relationship to Jesus
Jesus Christ is our Lord
Their faith was in Christ Jesus.
Epaphras was a minister of Christ, and a servant of Christ
Through Jesus, we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
He is the head of the body, the church
and through him to reconcile to himself all things
all things were reconciled through his blood, shed on the cross.
Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight -- without blemish and free from accusation, if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel.
The church is Jesus' body.
The mystery: Christ in you, the hope of glory.
Jesus is the one we proclaim.
The goal is to present everyone fully mature in Christ.
Called to "continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him"
Don't depend on human tradition, hollow and deceptive philosophy. Depend on Christ.
In Christ you have been brought to fullness
We were circumcised by Christ when we were "buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead."
We're made alive with Christ.
Our sins were nailed to the cross.
We must be connected to the head [Christ] in order to grow.
We died with Christ [to the elemental spiritual forces of this world]
We have been raised with Christ.
Called to set our minds, hearts on things above, where Christ is.
Our life is now hidden with Christ in God.
"When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory"
	This is *why* we put to death the deeds of the flesh.
Whatever you do, "whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."

## Our union with each other through Jesus
The people in Colossae are "faithful brothers and sisters in Christ"
"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts..."
"Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish..."
Slaves: it is the Lord Christ you are serving.
We will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.
