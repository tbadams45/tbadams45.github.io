Welcome! I'm Tim Adams - a disciple of Jesus Christ. I recenly graduated from UMass Amherst with a B.S. computer systems engineering, and am pursuing a Masters of Engineering in Environmental Engineering Science at MIT. 

This site is a fairly random collection of things I'm interested in, care about, and/or consider worth sharing. As I continue to add to what's here, I intend to include posts that cover most/all areas of my life -- my faith, hobbies, school, work, etc.

If you'd like to contact me to respond to a post or for any other reason, you can reach me at tbadams45@gmail.com. I'd love to chat.
