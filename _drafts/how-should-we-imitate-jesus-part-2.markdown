title: How should we imitate Jesus?
layout: post
---


## In humility and service to others
- John 13:1-15
  - Jesus set us an example: we should wash one another's feet. 
  - Now, there's a thought here: do we take this literally, or not? Do we need to wash each other's feet? I think we... don't. Jesus performed a specific act of service to demonstrate the heart of service that we should have. But we can look into that. 

- Philippians 2:5-8
  - Called to imitate Jesus in his humility and servant heart.
  - P.S.: "Do *nothing* out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves." (!)

## In holiness and righteousness
- 1 Peter 1:15-16
  - "Be holy, as I am holy". Called to exemplify God's holiness. The scripture relates this to "not conforming to the evil desires" we had in our previous lives. 

## In love
- Ephesians 5:1-2
  - Called to "be imitators of God". How? By living a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

- Luke 6:35
  - Mercy. "But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. *Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.*" (See also Matthew 5:48)

- John 13:34-35

## In forgiveness
- Colossians 3:12-14
  - While this scripture calls us to a number of virtues: compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience (and love, later), we are called to "forgive as the Lord forgave you." 

- Ephesians 4:32
  - Forgiveness. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

## In giving
- 2 Corinthians 8:1-9
  - "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich." Called to mimic Jesus in his giving of himself, and mirror this in our giving of material possessions to support our brothers.

## In perseverance
- Hebrews 12:1-4 
  - Called to throw off sin and run with perseverance. To fix our eyes on Jesus. He endured, and we are called to consider him so that we will not grow weary ourself. Therefore, we are called to imitate Jesus' endurance. 


It's not just the specific areas, but the manner in which and the extent to which Jesus lived them out.


Other scriptures that I thought of: 
- 1 Peter 4:1-2
- 1 John 3:16-20

On following:
- Luke 9:23
- **1 John 2:3-6**

Following Paul's example:
- 1 Corinthians 11:1
