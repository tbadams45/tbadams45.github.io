*This post is the first in a series discussed in my [previous post]({% post_url 2019-09-10-what-bible-questions-do-you-want-to-know-how-to-answer %}). If you haven't read it yet, I recommend doing so before you read this post.*

In John 1, Philip gets really excited after having met Jesus and goes and tells Nathanael about him:

> "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wroteâ€”Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." *John 1:45* 

Jesus says something similar to his disciples at the end of the Gospels, after his resurrection:

> "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms." *Luke 24:44*

These scriptures both get to the fact that the Jews were waiting for someone who had been prophesied about long before Jesus came onto the scene. Most Christians have heard of some of the prophecies, particularly those in the prophets (e.g. "The virgin will be with child" in Isaiah 7:14 or the Suffering Servant in Isaiah 53). But both Philip and Jesus mention a specific author: Moses. Moses was understood to be the author of the first five books of the Old Testament. And so our question is... (*drum roll*)

**Where did Moses write about Jesus?**

I was about to write "stay tuned," but that provokes an image of you sitting on your couch and waiting for the commercial to end so you can hear the answer. Perhaps more appropriate is "on your mark... get set... go!" 

(If you'd like a hint, check out Acts 3:17-23 and Acts 7:37.)
