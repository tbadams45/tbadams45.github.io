In my previous post, I wrote about [the reasons I memorize scripture]({% post_url 2020-11-08-why-memorize-scripture %}). Most people have had some experience with memorization, and it is often a frustrating process. I would like to share a method with you that I've found produces much more effective results to help you memorize more in less time and with less frustration.

The key idea behind memorizing is that you want to practice 

## 

1. Write the first letter of every word on a page, with punctuation.
2. While reading your first letter page, listen to the section  trying to memorize a dozen or so times, until you can easily recite the passage using just the first letters.
3. Take a break - sleep on it
4. Read the passage a dozen or so times, using just the first letters as your reference. Meditate on the meaning of the passage, on its structure, and on how the pieces play into the whole. The more you think about what it means the easier it will be to remember.
5. Take a break. Sleep on it.
6. Start trying to recite the passage from memory, without any prompts. It will be hard. That's ok. The method is to do as much as you can, and then once you get stuck to quickly review your first letters to see where you went wrong. This is the most important part though, because practicing recall is a very different thing than just reading, so you really want to try to not use your notes.
7. Once you've memorized it fully, use a tool like Anki to make spaced-based repetition flash cards so you never forget (optional step but very powerful)
