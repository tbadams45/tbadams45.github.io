title: What Bible questions do you want to know how to answer?
layout: post

In order to really understand something, I have to apply it and teach it. Often, just taking in information gives me the illusion of true understanding, but this illusion is shattered the first time I try to apply it in some novel way. Despite this being a more or less universal fact, it's still very easy for us to fall into the trap of substituting the simple consumption of information for the acquisition of true understanding. Learning something well enough to use it/teach it/apply it takes work and practice, but it's well worth it. 

As anyone who has skimmed the posts of this blog will know, I am a Christian, and as such I believe that studying the Word of God is one of the most valuable things we can do with our time. I want to be able to *apply* the scriptures accurately in my life, and *teach* the scriptures to others so that they can know God. If you are a Christian, Dear Reader, I also want you to be able to do this too.

## The Brilliant Idea

I'm toying with an idea of how we can do this together. *In order to learn how to apply and teach God's word, let's practice teaching.* How do we practice teaching? By answering questions. I'd make a post that is centered around some question. This question could be anything, but here a few I came up with quickly (of course, these are only a tiny fraction of the questions you could ask about the Scriptures):

- What is the theme of Jesus' teaching?
- What does it mean to obey Jesus?
- How did the early Christians in Acts respond to persecution?
- What does it mean to have an eternal perspective?
- What does the Bible teach us about how to use our finances?
- How did the early Christians in Acts reach out to Gentiles (specifically, people who didn't know God)?
- Where in the OT was the Messiah's name prophesied to be Jesus?

In this first post, I'd introduce the question and potentially provide some initial viewpoints one could take or scriptures one could look at to answer that question. However, I wouldn't try to actually answer the question. Instead, I'll provide the context to the question so that *you* can be equipped to answer the question. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to go back to your Bible and try to answer that question from the scriptures. Of course, you can use other sources too in your research (I will), but the key thing here is that we're trying to learn how to teach *the Bible*. If you want to teach the Bible to someone, you have to be able to use the Bible to do it, and not rely on some third party. 

Once you've had the time to take your crack at finding the answer (maybe a week later, maybe two, maybe a month, depending on how much I've got my act together), I'll post my best attempt. If you know me personally, we can discuss the question at any point along the way. If not, but you'd still like to interact, you can drop me an email with your thoughts at tbadams45@gmail.com. 

## ... What Do You Think?

I'm curious. If you've got any questions you'd like to tackle, let me know. I think this could be a cool way of studying the Scriptures together. But to do it together, I need you to join me. ðŸ™ƒ
