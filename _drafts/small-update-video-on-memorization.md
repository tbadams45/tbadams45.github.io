As those of you who follow this blog know, my past few posts have been on memorizing scripture: why do it, how to do it, and a guest post from someone who's tried the method I've developed over the past several years.  If you or someone else you know is a more visual/auditory learner, I've recorded a 25 minute workshop that walks through the same content in my first two posts. You can find that video [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11rXrzTxozyXylc-s9odygCkEuvZO8g5m?usp=sharing). If you have tried this method and found it helpful, please consider forwarding these resources on to others!
