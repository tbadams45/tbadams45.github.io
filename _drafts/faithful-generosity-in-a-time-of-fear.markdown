title: Faithful generosity in a time of fear

It is now a (true) cliché to mention how COVID-19 has upended our lives. So rather than repeat a lengthy introduction that reiterates that, I'd like to dive right into some thoughts of how we can faithfully respond in this time of uncertainty and fear. 

This blog is about the Kingdom of God, and how 
In particular, I want to focus on the opportunities we have to love our neighbor in this time.

In just two weeks, the latest coronavirus (COVID-19) has gone from an "out there" issue to a *right here* issue that has upended the daily life of almost everyone I know. Along with the immediate physical and economic effects comes a massive dose of uncertainty about the future. Will I be OK? Will my loved ones be OK? What happens if I lose my job? If my hours get cut? etc. etc. etc. For most of us, this uncertainty about the future is quickly followed by fear. I can feel it in the air--when I was out on a walk, a mother and her daughter stopped 50 feet away so that I could pass without getting near them. I can feel it in the news, in my conversations with people on the phone. I can feel it in myself.
9What do we do with this fear? How do we respond? It is easy to respond by retreating, hiding, and defending ourselves from what we consider to be a threat. When I was on the T two days ago, there was a woman who coughed without covering her mouth. A woman near her recoiled--several others gave dirty looks, watching her constantly until she got off the train. I felt it within myself too; an indignation at this person that was certainly partly justified but was amplified many times over by my fear of getting infected myself. 

There is a good chance that we are going to be in the thick of this for a long time. In Hubei, [the lockdowns are just beginning to ease](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/11/china-new-normal-coronavirus-pandemic-quarantine-ai-fen-propaganda/), more than three months after the outbreak has begun. There's a good chance that things will be worse and last longer in the US due to the difference in the measures that we are taking compared to the Chinese. 

But the point of this post isn't meant to look into the data and try to make predictions about what will or will not happen. Suffice it to say that we will be feeling the effects of COVID-19 for a long period of time, and those effects are going to have a dramatic impact on ourselves and those around us. Although we can want to give into our fear, we cannot, must not. There is a tremendous opportunity at this time to demonstrate the love of Jesus, but we must have the courage to do so.

I'd like to propose three things we can do to demonstrate that love. 

1. Practice contentment with less
	those who are able to give, give
	those who are not used to being in need, learning how to accept help?
2. Keep your eyes open to the needs of others
3. Embody faithful generosity in the face of those needs

Lk 12:32-34
Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Gal 6:9-10
Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 10Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

Pro 19:17
“Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will reward them for what they have done.”

Pro 22:9
“The generous will themselves be blessed, for they share their food with the poor.”

1 John 3:16-18
This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? 18 Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.


Mk 10:41-45
41 When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. 42 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 43 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. 45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

Jn 12:23-28
23 Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24 Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. 25 Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.

27 “Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. 28 Father, glorify your name!”


Matthew 25:34-40
34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’

37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’

40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
