Then, as was natural for people involved in a miserable misfortune, they accused themselves as having brought a heavier affliction on themselves than they need have done. "For why," said they, "did we not expose him at the first moment of his birth?" For people in general do not look upon one who has not lived long enough to partake of salutary food as a human being at all.

When the king heard of this action [Moses killing an Egyptian] he was very indignant, thinking it an intolerable thing, not for one man to be dead, or for another to have killed him, whether justly or unjustly, but for his grandson not to agree with him, and not to look upon his friends or his enemies as his own, but to hate persons whom the king loved, and to love persons whom the king looked upon as outcasts, and to pity those whom he regarded with unchangeable and implacable aversion.  location 17242

Now there were seven damsels, whose father was the priest, and they all came to a certain fountain leading their flocks, and having loosened their vessels and let them down by thongs they succeeded one another in drawing up the water, so as for them all to have an equal share in the work; and in this way they cheerfully and rapidly filled the troughs which were at hand.

But when anyone went out of doors and learnt the misfortunes of others also, he at once felt a double sorrow, grieving for the common calamity, . . . ran weeping to the king's palace, and rent their clothes, and cried out against the sovereign, as the cause of all the terrible evils that had befallen them.

So they [the Israelites], being now driven out of the land and pursued, coming at last to a proper notion of their own nobility and worth, . . . for they carried off abundant booty, which they themselves collected, by means of the hatred in which they were held, and some of it they carried themselves, submitting to heavy burdens, and some they placed upon their beasts of burden, not in order to gratify any love of money, or, as any usurer might say, because they coveted their neighbors' goods. (How should they do so?) But, first of all, because they were thus receiving the necessary wages from those whom they had served for so long a time; and, secondly, because they had a right to afflict those at whose hands they had suffered wrong with afflictions slighter than, and by no means equal to, what they had endured. For how can the deprivation of money and treasures be equivalent to the loss of liberty?  . . . on behalf of which those who are in possession of their senses dare not only to cast away all their property, but even to venture their lives?   location 17588

Such, then, were the afflictions and punishments by which Egypt was corrected; not one of which ever touched the Hebrews, although they were dwelling in the same cities and villages, and even houses, as the Egyptians, and touching the same earth and water, and air and fire, which are all component parts of nature, and which it is impossible to escape from.  location 17594

And of those who now went forth out of Egypt and left their abodes in that country, the men of age to bear arms were more than six hundred thousand men, and the other multitude of elders, and children, and women were so great that it was not easy to calculate it. Moreover, there also went forth with them a mixed multitude of various persons collected from all quarters, and servants, like an illegitimate crowd with a body of genuine citizens. . . . Among these were those who had been born to Hebrew fathers by Egyptian women, and who were enrolled as members of their father's race. And, also, all those who had admired the decent piety of the men, and therefore joined them; and some, also, who had come over to them, having learned the right way, by reason of the magnitude and multitude of the incessant punishments which had been inflicted on their own countrymen.  location 17614

Therefore, when the chief of a nation begins to indulge in luxury and to turn aside to a delicate and effeminate life, then the whole of his subjects, or very nearly the whole, carry their desire for indulging the appetites of the belly and the parts below the belly beyond all reasonable bounds. . . . If, on the other hand, the chief of a people adopts a more austere and dignified course of life, then even those of his subjects, who are inclined to be very incontinent, change and become temperate, hastening, either out of fear or out of shame, to give him an idea that they are devoted to the same pursuits and inclinations that he is; and, in fact, the lower orders will never, no, nor will mad men even, reject the customs and habits of their superiors:  location 17665

Then he led them forward, not by the shortest road, partly because he was afraid lest the inhabitants should come out to meet and to resist him in his march, from fear of being overthrown and enslaved by such a multitude, and so, if a war arose, they might be again driven back into Egypt,   location 17672

For the nation itself was divided into twelve tribes, each of which, if pious and religious, would be looked upon in the light of a fountain, since piety is continually pouring forth everlasting and unceasing springs of virtuous actions.

(con't) For some persons say, and not without some reason and propriety, that this is the only way by which cities can be expected to advance in improvement, if either the kings cultivate philosophy, or if philosophers exercise the kingly power. But Moses will be seen not only to have displayed all these powers--I mean the genius of the philosopher and of the king--in an extraordinary degree at the same time, but three other powers likewise, one of which is conversant about legislation, the second about the way of discharging the duties of high priest, and the last about the prophetic office;  location 18302

And first of all we must speak of the matters which relate to his [Moses'] character and conduct as a lawgiver. . . . in fact Moses appears to have been the only person who has ever done, having given a very clear description of the aforesaid virtues in the commandments which he established.

of all the cities in Greece and in the territory of the barbarians, if one may so say, speaking generally, there is not one single city which pays any respect to the laws of another state. In fact, a city scarcely adheres to its own laws with any constancy forever, but continually modifies them, and adapts them to the changes of times and circumstances. The Athenians rejected the customs and laws of the Lacedaemonians, and so did the Lacedaemonians repudiate the laws of the Athenians. . . .

V. And that beauty and dignity of the legislation of Moses is honored not among the Jews only, but also by all other nations, is plain, both from what has been already said and from what I am about to state. In olden time the laws were written in the Chaldean language, and for a long time they remained in the same condition as at first, not changing their language as long as their beauty had not made them known to other nations; but when, from the daily and uninterrupted respect shown to them by those to whom they had been given, and from their ceaseless observance of their ordinances, other nations also obtained an understanding of them, their reputation spread over all lands; for what was really good, even though it may through envy be overshadowed for a short time, still in time shines again through the intrinsic excellence of its nature.  location 18380

Some persons, thinking it a scandalous thing that these laws should only be known among one half portion of the human race, namely, among the barbarians, and that the Greek nation should be wholly and entirely ignorant of them, turned their attention to their translation. And since this undertaking was an important one, tending to the general advantage, not only of private persons, but also of rulers, of whom the number was not great, it was entrusted to kings and to the most illustrious of all kings. Ptolemy, surnamed Philadelphus, was the third in succession after Alexander, the monarch who subdued Egypt;  location 18386

And he [Ptolemy Philadelphus] was, in all virtues which can be displayed in government, the most excellent sovereign, not only of all those of his time, but of all that ever lived; so that even now, after the lapse of so many generations, his fame is still celebrated, as having left many instances and monuments of his magnanimity in the cities and districts of his kingdom, so that even now it is come to be a sort of proverbial expression to call excessive magnificence, and zeal, for honor and splendor in preparation, Philadelphian, from his name;  location 18391   
Philo, On the Life of Moses, Book II, ch.5

{Septuagint}
and, in a word, the whole family of the Ptolemies was exceedingly eminent and conspicuous above all other royal families, and among the Ptolemies, Philadelphus was the most illustrious; for all the rest put together scarcely did as many glorious and praiseworthy actions as this one king did by himself, being, as it were, the leader of the herd, and in a manner the head of all the kings.  location 18394

VI. He, then, being a sovereign of this character, and having conceived a great admiration for and love of the legislation of Moses, conceived the idea of having our laws translated into the Greek language; and immediately he sent out ambassadors to the high-priest and king of Judea, for they were the same person. And having explained his wishes, and having requested him to pick him out a number of men, of perfect fitness for the task, who should translate the Law, Mosaic high-priest, as was natural, being greatly pleased, and thinking that the king had only felt the inclination to undertake a work of such a character from having been influenced by the providence of God, considered, and with great care selected the most respectable of the Hebrews whom he had about him, who in addition to their knowledge of their national scriptures, had also been well instructed in Grecian literature, and cheerfully sent them.  location 18397

And when they arrived at the king's court they were hospitably received by the king; and while they feasted, they in return feasted their entertainer with witty and virtuous conversation; for he made experiment of the wisdom of each individual among them, putting to them a succession of new and extraordinary questions;  location 18403   
Philo, On the Life of Moses, Book II

{Septuagint}
So when they had won his approval, they immediately began to fulfil the objects for which that honorable embassy had been sent; and considering among themselves how important the affair was, to translate laws which had been divinely given by direct inspiration, since they were not able either to take away anything, or to add anything, or to alter anything, but were bound to preserve the original form and character of the whole composition, they looked out for the most completely purified place of all the spots on the outside of the city.  location 18407

The island of Pharos lies in front of Alexandria, the neck of which runs out like a sort of tongue towards the city, being surrounded with water of no great depth, but chiefly with shoals and shallow water, so that the great noise and roaring from the beating of the waves is kept at a considerable distance, and so mitigated. They judged this place to be the most suitable of all the spots in the neighborhood for them to enjoy quiet and tranquility in, so that they might associate with the laws alone in their minds;  location 18412

for the account of the creation of the world is the beginning of the Law they, like men inspired, prophesied, not one saying one thing and another, but everyone of them employed the self-same nouns and verbs, as if some unseen prompter had suggested all their language to them. And yet who is there who does not know that every language, and the Greek language above all others, is rich in a variety of words, and that it is possible to vary a sentence and to paraphrase the same idea, so as to set it forth in a great variety of manners, adapting many different forms of expression to it at different times.  location 18420

But this, they say, did not happen at all in the case of this translation of the law, but that, in every case, exactly corresponding Greek words were employed to translate literally the appropriate Chaldaic words, being adapted with exceeding propriety to the matters which were to be explained;  location 18424   
Philo, On the Life of Moses, Book II

{Septuagint}
And there is a very evident proof of this; for if Chaldaeans were to learn the Greek language, and if Greeks were to learn Chaldaean, and if each were to meet with those scriptures in both languages, namely, the Chaldaic and the translated version, they would admire and reverence them both as sisters, or rather as one and the same both in their facts and in their language;  location 18429

And after the prayers and the giving of thanks some of them pitched their tents on the shore, and some of them lay down without any tents in the open air on the sand of the shore, and feasted with their relations and friends, thinking the shore at that time a more beautiful abode than the furniture of the king's palace.  location 18436

First, that the same Being was the Father and Creator of the world, and likewise the Lawgiver of truth; secondly, that the man who adhered to these laws, and clung closely to a connection with and obedience to nature, would live in a manner corresponding to the arrangement of the universe with a perfect harmony and union,  location 18453

X. At all events if anyone were inclined to examine with accuracy the powers of each individual and particular law, he will find them all aiming at the harmony of the universe, and corresponding to the law of eternal nature: on which account those men who have had unbounded prosperity bestowed upon them, and all things tending to the production of health of body, and riches, and glory, and all other external parts of good fortune, but who have rejected virtue, and have chosen crafty wickedness, and all others kinds of vice, not through compulsion, but of their own spontaneous free will, looking upon that which is the greatest of all evils as the greatest possible advantage, he looks upon as enemies not of mankind only, but of the entire heaven and world, and says that they are awaiting, not any ordinary punishments, but new and extraordinary ones, which that constant assessor of God, justice, who detests wickedness, invents and inflicts terribly upon them, turning against them the most powerful elements of the universe, water and fire, so that at appointed times some are destroyed by deluges, others are burnt with fire, and perish in that manner.  location 18470

And this last thing, indeed, he had despised for a long time, and almost from the first moment that he began to prophesy and to feel a divine inspiration, thinking that it was proper that he should at all times be ready to give his whole attention to the commands of God.  location 18533

Now the under-robe was of a more simple form and character, for it was entirely of hyacinthine colours, except the lowest and exterior portions, and these were ornamented with golden pomegranates, and bells, and wreaths of flowers; (111) but the robe over the shoulders or mantle was a most beautiful and skilful work, and was made with most perfect skill of all the aforesaid kinds of material, of hyacinth colour, and purple, and fine linen, and scarlet, gold thread being entwined and embroidered in it. For the leaves were divided into fine hairs, and woven in with every thread, (112) and on the collar stones were fitted in, two being costly emeralds of exceeding value, on which the names of the patriarchs of the tribes were engraved, six on each, making twelve in all; and on the breast were twelve other precious stones, differing in colour like seals, in four rows of three stones each, and these were fitted in what was called the logeum (113) and the logeum was made square and double, as a sort of foundation, that it mighty bear on it, as an image, two virtues, manifestation and truth; and the whole was fastened to the mantle by fine golden chains, and fastened to it so that it might never get loose; (114) and a golden leaf was wrought like a crown, having four names engraved on it which may only be mentioned or heard by holy men having their ears and their tongues purified by wisdom, and by no one else at all in any place whatever.

XXVI. The high priest, then, being equipped in this way, is properly prepared for the performance of all sacred ceremonies, that, whenever he enters the temple to offer up the prayers and sacrifices in use among his nation, all the world may likewise enter in with him, by means of the imitations of it which he bears about him, the garment reaching to his feet, being the imitation of the air, the pomegranate of the water, the flowery hem of the earth, and the scarlet dye of his robe being the emblem of fire; also, the mantle over his shoulders being a representation of heaven itself; the two hemispheres being further indicated by the round emeralds on the shoulder-blades, on each of which were engraved six characters equivalent to six signs of the zodiac; the twelve stones arranged on the breast in four rows of three stones each, namely the logeum, being also an emblem of that Reason [Logos] which holds together and regulates the universe. (134) For it was indispensable that the man [i. e. the high priest?] who was consecrated to the Father of the world, should have as a Paraclete, His Son, the Being most perfect in all virtue, to procure forgiveness of sins, and a supply of unlimited blessings; (135) perhaps, also, he is thus giving a previous warning to the servant of God, even if he is unable to make himself worthy of the Creator, of the world, at least to labor incessantly to make himself worthy of the world itself; the image of which he is clothed in, in a manner that binds him from the time that he puts it on, to bear about the pattern of it in his mind, so that he shall be in a manner changed from the nature of a man into the nature of the world   location 18748

Having employed on its formation vessels which had been constructed with great care for other purpose; and which the women contributed with all imaginable zeal and eagerness, in rivalry of one another, competing with the men themselves in piety, having determined to enter upon a glorious contest, and to the utmost extent of their power to exert themselves so as not to fall short of their holiness. For though no one enjoined them to do so, they, of their own spontaneous zeal and earnestness, contributed the mirrors with which they had been accustomed to deck and set off their beauty, as the most becoming first fruits of their modesty, and of the purity of their married life, and as one may say of the beauty of their souls. The maker then thought it well to accept these offerings, and to melt them down, and to make nothing except the laver of them in order that the priests who were about to enter the temple might be supplied from it, with water of purification for the purpose of performing the sacred ministrations which were appointed for them; washing their feet most especially, and their hands, as a symbol of their irreproachable life, and of a course of conduct which makes itself pure in all kinds of praiseworthy actions, proceeding not along the rough road of wickedness which one may more properly call no road at all, but keeping straight along the level and direct path of virtue. (139) Let him remember, says he, let him who is about to be sprinkled with the water of purification from this laver, remember that the materials of which this vessel was composed were mirrors, that he himself may look into his own mind as into a mirror;  18763

(141) And when he had been taught the patterns of the sacred tabernacle, and had in turn himself taught those who were gifted with acute comprehension, and well-qualified by nature for the comprehension and execution of those works, which it was indispensably necessary should be made; then, as was natural, when the temple had been built and finished, it was fitting also, that most suitable persons should be appointed as priests, and should be instructed in what manner it was proper for them to offer up their sacrifices, and perform their sacred ministrations. (142) Accordingly, Moses selected his brother, choosing him out of all men, because of his superior virtue, to be high priest, and his sons he appointed priests, not giving precedence to his own family, but to the piety and holiness which he perceived to exist in those men; and what is the clearest proof of this is, that he did not think either of his sons worthy of this honor (and he had two); while he must inevitably have appointed both of them, if he had attached any importance to love for his family;  location 18778

(162) Then, having made a golden calf in imitation of that which appeared to be the most sacred animal in that district, they offered up unholy sacrifices, and instituted blasphemous dances, and sang hymns which differed in no respect from dirges, and, being filled with strong wine, gave themselves up to a twofold intoxication, the intoxication of wine and that of folly, reveling and devoting the night to feasting, and, having no foresight as to the future, they spent their time in pleasant sins, though justice had her eye upon them, who saw them while they would not see, and decided what punishments they deserved. location 18849

(211) For this reason the all-great Moses thought fit that all who were enrolled in his sacred polity should follow the laws of nature and meet in a solemn assembly, passing the time in cheerful joy and relaxation, abstaining from all work, and from all arts which have a tendency to the production of anything; and from all business which is connected with the seeking of the means of living, and that they should keep a complete truce, abstaining from all laborious and fatiguing thought and care, and devoting their leisure, not as some persons scoffingly assert, to sports, or exhibitions of actors and dancers, for the sake of which those who run madly after theatrical amusements suffer disasters and even encounter miserable deaths, and for the sake of these the most dominant and influential of the outward senses, sight and hearing, make the soul, which should be the heavenly nature, the slave of these senses.

On which account Moses, in many places, forbids anyone to handle a fire on the sabbath day, inasmuch as that is the most primary and efficient source of things and the most ancient and important work; and if that is reduced to a state of tranquility, he thought that it would be probable that all particular works would be at a stand-still likewise.

* Rosh Hashanah ?, literally meaning the "beginning (also head) [of] the year") is the Jewish New Year. The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah ( ?), literally "day [of] shouting/blasting", sometimes translated as the Feast of Trumpets. It is the first of the Jewish High Holy Days (? Yamim Nora'im, lit. "Days [of] Awe") specified by Leviticus 23:23–32, which usually occur in the early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere.

The earliest origins of the Hebrew New Year are connected to the beginning of the economic year in the agricultural societies of the ancient Near East. The New Year was the beginning of the cycle of sowing, growth, and harvest, the latter marked by its own set of major agricultural festivals. The Semites in general set the beginning of the new year in autumn, while other ancient civilizations such as the Persians or Greeks chose spring for that purpose, in both cases the primary reason being agricultural – the time of sowing the seed and of bringing in the harvest.(  Isidore Singer, J. F. McLaughlin, Wilhelm Bacher, Judah David Eisenstein(1901–1906). "New-Year". Jewish Encyclopedia. New York: Funk and Wagnalls. Retrieved 2015-09-13.) 
* It is very interesting that Persians/Afghanis still put down the beginning of the vernal equinox as the first month of the year called "Nowruz".(source)

XLI. Moses puts down the beginning of the vernal equinox as the first month of the year, attributing the chief honor, not as some persons do to the periodical revolutions of the year in regard of time, but rather to the graces and beauties of nature which it has caused to shine upon men; . . . And the fruit of trees in their prime, which is second in importance only to the necessary crops, is engendered by the same power, and as being second in importance it also ripens late; for we always find in nature that those things which are not very necessary are second to those which are indispensable. Now wheat and barley are among the things which are very necessary; as, likewise, are all the other species of food, without which it is impossible to live. But oil, and wine, and almonds are not among necessaries, since men often live without them to the very extremity of old age,  location 19070

Accordingly, in this month, about the fourteenth day of the month, when the orb of the moon is usually about to become full, the public universal feast of the Passover is celebrated, which in the Chaldaic language is called pascha; . . . the whole nation is consecrated and officiates in offering sacrifice; every separate individual on this occasion bringing forward and offering up with his own hands the sacrifice due on his own behalf.  location 19074

it seemed proper for men to divide the inheritances among themselves, that so they might receive the due reward of their military services and of the wars which they had gone through. But nature, which has given to woman protection from all such contests, does likewise by so doing plainly deprive them of their right to a share in what is put forward as a reward for encountering them.  location 19119

But Moses, having praised the conversation of the maidens, did not either leave them without their due honor and reward, nor yet, on the other hand, did he raise them to an equal degree of honor with the men on whom the brunt of the war falls; but to the latter he allotted the inheritances as the prizes which belonged to them as a reward for the gallant exploits which they had performed. But the former he thought worthy of grace and kindness, not of reward; as he showed most plainly by the expressions which he used, speaking of "gifts" and "presents," but not of "requital" or "recompense." For the one form of language is suited to those who receive what they have a right to, and the other belongs to those who are treated with gratuitous favor.  location 19138

And, after the daughters, then he invites the brothers to share it in the third place; and, in the fourth place, he assigns the property to the uncles on the father's side, showing under this figure that the fathers might, if alive be the heirs of their sons.  location 19145

XLIV. The law permits the property of parents to be inherited by the children, but does not allow the parents themselves to inherit [from the children], in order that the father and mother might not seem to receive any gain from the inconsolable affliction of the loss of children dying prematurely; but he indirectly intimated their right to be invited to such an inheritance when he conceded it to the uncles, in order that in this way he might attain the best objects of cultivating propriety and of avoiding the improper alienation of the estate.  location 19153

XLVI (cont) For this mercy Moses very naturally honored his Benefactor with hymns of gratitude. For having divided the host into two choruses, one of men and one of women, he himself became the leader of that of the men, and appointed his sister to be the chief of that of the women, that they might sing hymns to their father and Creator, joining in harmonies responsive to one another, by a combination of dispositions and melody, the former being eager to offer the same requital for the mercies which they had received, and the latter consisting of a symphony of the deep male with the high female voices, for the tones of men are deep and those of women are high; and when there is a perfect and harmonious combination of the two a most delightful and thoroughly harmonious melody is effected.

but the deliberate intention of the philosopher is at once displayed from the appellation given to them; for with strict regard to etymology, they are called therapeutae and therapeutrides, (from therapeuoµ, "to heal.") either because they process an art of medicine more excellent than that in general use in cities (for that only heals bodies, but the other heals souls which are under the mastery of terrible and almost incurable diseases, which pleasures and appetites, fears and griefs, and covetousness, and follies, and injustice, and all the rest of the innumerable multitude of other passions and vices, have inflicted upon them), or else because they have been instructed by nature and the sacred laws to serve the living God, who is superior to the good, and more simple than the one, and more ancient than the unit; with whom, however, who is there of those who profess piety that we can possibly compare?   location 26014

What, again, shall we say of the demi-gods? This is a matter which is perfectly ridiculous: for how can the same man be both mortal and immortal, even if we leave out of the question the fact that the origin of the birth of all these beings is liable to reproach, as being full of youthful intemperance, which its authors endeavor with great profanity to impute to blessed and divine natures, as if they, being madly in love with mortal women, had connected themselves with them; while we know gods to be free from all participation in and from all influence of passion, and completely happy.   location 26031

But they who apply themselves to this kind of worship, not because they are influenced to do so by custom, nor by the advice or recommendation of any particular persons, but because they are carried away by a certain heavenly love, give way to enthusiasm, behaving like so many revelers in bacchanalian or corybantian mysteries, until they see the object which they have been earnestly desiring. Then, because of their anxious desire for an immortal and blessed existence, thinking that their mortal life has already come to an end, they leave their possessions to their sons or daughters, or perhaps to other relations, giving them up their inheritance with willing cheerfullness; and those who know no relations give their property to their companions or friends, for it followed of necessity that those who have acquired the wealth which sees, as if ready prepared for them, should be willing to surrender that wealth which is blind to those who themselves also are still blind in their minds.   location 26052

Each description, indeed, has its own pleasures, but the recorded by Xenophon is the one the delights of which are most in accordance with human nature, for female harp-players, and dancers, and conjurors, and jugglers, and men who do ridiculous things, who pride themselves much on their powers of jesting and of amusing others, and many other species of more cheerful relaxation, are brought forward at it. But the entertainment recorded by Plato is almost entirely connected with love; not that of men madly desirous or fond of women, or of women furiously in love with men, for these desires are accomplished in accordance with a law of nature, but with that love which is felt by men for one another, differing only in respect of age; for if there is anything in the account of that banquet elegantly said in praise of genuine love and heavenly Venus, it is introduced merely for the sake of making a neat speech; for the greater part of the book is occupied by common, vulgar, promiscuous love, which takes away from the soul courage, that which is the most serviceable of all virtues both in war and in peace, and which engenders in it instead the female disease, and renders men men-women, though they ought rather to be carefully trained in all the practices likely to give men valor. . . . And having corrupted the age of boys, and having metamorphosed them and removed them into the classification and character of women, it has injured their lovers also in the most important particulars, their bodies, their souls, and their properties; for it follows of necessity that the mind of a lover of boys must be kept on the stretch towards the objects of his affection, and must have no acuteness of vision for any other object, but must be blinded by its desire as to all other objects private or common, and must so be wasted away, more especially if it fails in its objects.   location 26230

I will oppose to them the entertainments of those persons [the therapeutae] who have devoted their whole life and themselves to the knowledge and contemplation of the affairs of nature in accordance with the most sacred admonitions and precepts of the prophet Moses. In the first place, these men assemble at the end of seven weeks, venerating not only the simple week of seven days, but also its multiplied power, for they know it to be pure and always virgin; and it is a prelude and a kind of forefeast of the greatest feast, which is assigned to the number fifty, the most holy and natural of numbers, being compounded of the power of the right-angled triangle, which is the principle of the origination and condition of the whole. Therefore when they come together clothed in white garments, and joyful with the most exceeding gravity, when someone of the ephemereutae (for that is the appellation which they are accustomed to give to those who are employed in such ministrations), before they sit down to meat standing in order in a row, and raising their eyes and their hands to heaven, the one because they have learnt to fix their attention on what is worthy looking at, and the other because they are free from the reproach of all impure gain, being never polluted under any pretence whatever by any description of criminality which can arise from any means taken to procure advantage, they pray to God that the entertainment may be acceptable, and welcome, and pleasing; and after having offered up these prayers the elders sit down to meat, still observing the order in which they were previously arranged, for they do not look on those as elders who are advanced in years and very ancient, but in some cases they esteem those as very young men, if they have attached themselves to this sect only lately, but those whom they call elders are those who from their earliest infancy have grown up and arrived at maturity in the speculative portion of philosophy, which is the most beautiful and most divine part of it.   location 26245

These, then, are the first circumstances of the feast [of the therapeutae]; but after the guests have sat down to the table in the order which I have been describing, and when those who minister to them are all standing around in order, ready to wait upon them,  . . . then someone looks out some passage in the sacred scriptures, or explains some difficulty which is proposed by someone else, without any thoughts of display on his own part,   location 26289

And these explanations of the sacred scriptures are delivered by mystic expressions in allegories, for the whole of the law appears to these men to resemble a living animal . . .

applause arises from them all as of men rejoicing together at what they have seen and heard; and then someone rising up sings a hymn which has been made in honor of God, either such as he has composed himself, or some ancient one of some old poet, . . . And after him then others also arise in their ranks, in becoming order, while everyone else listens in decent silence, except when it is proper for them to take up the burden of the song, and to join in at the end; for then they all, both men and women, join in the hymn.   location 26309

And when each individual has finished his psalm, then the young men bring in the table which was mentioned a little while ago, on which was placed that most holy food, the leavened bread, with a seasoning of salt, with which hyssop is mingled, out of reverence for the sacred table, which lies thus in the holy outer temple; for on this table are placed loaves and salt without seasoning, and the bread is unleavened, and the salt unmixed with anything else,   location 26310

This then is what I have to say of those who are called therapeutae, who have devoted themselves to the contemplation of nature, and who have lived in it and in the soul alone, being citizens of heaven and of the world, and very acceptable to the Father and Creator of the universe because of their virtue, which has procured them his love as their most appropriate reward,   location 26338

{Circumcision; Gen 17:10-14; Acts 15:1; Law, Mosaic}
I. The genera and heads of all special laws, which are called "the ten commandments," have been discussed with accuracy in the former treatise. We must now proceed to consider the particular commands as we read them in the subsequent passages of the holy scriptures; and we will begin with that which is turned into ridicule by people in general. (2) The ordinance of circumcision of the parts of generation is ridiculed, though it is an act which is practiced to no slight degree among other nations also, and most especially by the Egyptians, who appear to me to be the most populous of all nations, and the most abounding in all kinds of wisdom. (3) In consequence of which it would be most fitting for men to discard childish ridicule, and to investigate the real causes of the ordinance with more prudence and dignity, considering the reasons why the custom has prevailed, and not being precipitate, so as without examination to condemn the folly of mighty nations, recollecting that it is not probable that so many myriads should be circumcised in every generation, mutilating the bodies of themselves and of their nearest relations, in a manner which is accompanied with severe pain, without adequate cause; but that there are many reasons which might encourage men to persevere and continue a custom which has been introduced by previous generations, and that these are from reasons of the greatest weight and importance. (4) First of all, that it is a preventive of a painful disease, and of an affliction difficult to be cured, which they call a carbuncle; [Fn. the Greek word is anthrax, which also signifies a coal. The Latin, from which our carbuncle is derived, carbunculus, a diminutive of carbo, which also means a coal.] because, I imagine, when it becomes inflamed it burns; from which fact it has derived that appellation. And this disease is very apt to be engendered among those who have not undergone the rite of circumcision. (5) Secondly, it secures the cleanliness of the whole body in a way that is suited to the people consecrated to God; with which object the Egyptian priests, being extravagant in their case, shave the whole of their bodies; for some of these evils which ought to be got rid of are collected in and lodge under the hair and the prepuce. (6) Thirdly, there is the resemblance of the part that is circumcised to the heart; for both parts are prepared for the sake of generation; for the breath contained within the heart is generative of thoughts, and the generative organ itself is productive of living beings. Therefore, the men of old thought it right to make the evident and visible organ, by which the objects of the outward senses are generated, resemble that invisible and superior part, by means of which ideas are formed. (7) The fourth, and most important, is that which relates to the provision thus made [to enable them to be] prolific; for it is said that the seminal fluid proceeds in its path easily, neither being at all scattered, nor flowing on its passage into what may be called the bags of the prepuce. On which account those nations which practice circumcision are the most prolific and the most populous.

{Circumcision; Gen 17:10-14}
First of all, it is a symbol of the excision of the pleasures which delude the mind; for since, of all the delights which pleasure can afford, the association of man with woman is the most exquisite, it seemed good to the Lawgivers to mutilate the organ which ministers to such connections;  . . . The second thing is, that it is a symbol of a man's knowing himself, and discarding that terrible disease, the vain opinion of the soul;  location 19969

{Gen 1:1; Ps 90:1-2; Heavenly Bodies}
III. Some persons have conceived that the sun, and the moon, and the other stars are independent gods, to whom they have attributed the causes of all things that exist. But Moses was well aware that the world was created, and was like a very large city, having rulers and subjects in it; the rulers being all the bodies which are in heaven, such as planets and fixed stars; and the subjects being all the natures beneath the moon, hovering in the air and adjacent to the earth.  . . . But that the rulers aforesaid are not independent and absolute, but are the viceroys of one supreme Being, the Father of all, in imitation of whom they administer with propriety and success the charge committed to their care, as he also presides over all created things in strict accordance with justice and with law.  . . . We must, therefore, look on all those bodies in the heaven, which the outward sense regards as gods, not as independent rulers, since they are assigned the work of lieutenants, being by their intrinsic nature responsible to a higher power, but by reason of their virtue not actually called to render in an account of their doings. So that, transcending all visible essence by means of our reason, let us press forward to the honor of that everlasting and invisible Being who can be comprehended and appreciated by the mind alone;  location 19998

{Ex 20:23; 1 Tim 6:10}
"You shall not make to yourselves gods of silver and gold;" (Exodus 20:20) . . . And, besides this distinct prohibition, there is another meaning which appears to me to be intended to be figuratively conveyed under these words, which is one of very great influence as contributing to the formation of the moral character, and which convicts in no slight degree those who are covetous of money and who seek to procure silver and gold from all quarters, and when they have acquired it treasure it up, as though it were some divine image, in their inmost shrines, looking upon it as the cause of all good things and of all happiness. And all the poor men that are possessed of that terrible disease, the love of money, but who, from not having any riches of their own which they can think worthy of their attention, fix their admiration on the wealth of their neighbors, and, for the purpose of offering adoration to it, come the first thing in the morning to the houses of those who have abundance, as if they were noble temples at which they were going to offer prayers, and to entreat blessings from their owners as if from the gods.  location 20012

And to these men, Moses says, in another passage, "You shall not follow images, and you shall not make to yourselves molten gods." (Leviticus 19:4.) Teaching them, by figurative language, that it is not right to pay such honors to wealth as one would pay to the gods; for those celebrated materials of wealth, silver and gold, are made to be used, which, however, the multitude follows, looking upon them as the only causes of wealth which is proverbially called blind, and the especial sources of happiness.

{Ps 115:4-7; Isa 44:9-12; Heb 3:4; Rom 1:20}
It has invariably happened that the works which they have made have been, in some degree, the proofs of the character of the workmen; for who is there who, when he looks upon statues or pictures, does not at once form an idea of the statuary or painter himself? And who, when he beholds a garment, or a ship, or a house, does not in a moment conceive a notion of the weaver, or shipbuilder, or architect, who has made them?  . . . And if anyone comes into a well-ordered city, in which all parts of the constitution are exceedingly well arranged and regulated, what other idea will he entertain but that this city is governed by wise and virtuous rulers? He, therefore, who comes into that which is truly the greatest of cities, namely, this world, and who beholds all the land,  . . . And the world is the most artificial and skillfully made of all works, as if it had been put together by someone who was altogether accomplished and most perfect in knowledge.

not only to treat them [Jewish proselytes] with respect, but even with especial friendship and excessive benevolence. And is not this a reasonable recommendation? What he says is this. "Those men, who have left their country, and their friends, and their relations for the sake of virtue and holiness, ought not to be left destitute of some other cities, and houses, and friends, but there ought to be places of refuge always ready for those who come over to religion; for the most effectual allurement and the most indissoluble bond of affectionate good will is the mutual honoring of the one God."  location 20125

Moreover, he also enjoins his people that, after they have given the proselytes an equal share in all their laws, and privileges, and immunities, on their forsaking the pride of their fathers and forefathers, they must not give a license to their jealous language and unbridled tongues, blaspheming those beings whom the other body looks upon as gods, lest the proselytes should be exasperated at such treatment, and in return utter impious language against the true and holy God; for from ignorance of the difference between them, and by reason of their having from their infancy learnt to look upon what was false as if it had been true, and having been bred up with it, they would be likely to err.  location 20129

"All the cloisters were double, and the pillars to them belonging were twenty-five cubits in height, and supported -the cloisters. These pillars were of one entire stone each of them, and that stone was white marble; and the roofs were adorned with cedar, curiously graven. The natural magnificence, and excellent polish, and the harmony of the joints in these cloisters, afforded a prospect that was very remarkable; nor was it on the outside adorned with any work of the painter or engraver. The cloisters -(of the outmost court) were in breadth thirty cubits, while the entire compass of it was by measure six furlongs, including the tower of Antonia; those entire courts that were exposed to the air were laid with stones of all sorts" (Josephus, Jewish War 5. 5. 2).
XIII. Of this temple the outer circuit, being the most extensive both in length and width, was fortified by fortifications adorned in a most costly manner.

Secondly, because it is not proper that those things which conduce to the verdure of trees should be introduced, such as the dung of irrational animals and of men.  . . . And besides these reasons, shady places and dense thickets are places of refuge for evil doers, since by their enveloping them in darkness they give them safety and enable them, as from an ambuscade, suddenly to fall upon any whom they choose to attack. But wide spaces, open and uncovered in every direction, where there is nothing which can hinder the sight, are the most suitable for the distinct sight of all those who enter and remain in the temple.  location 20221

But the temple has for its revenues not only portions of land, but also other possessions of much greater extent and importance, which will never be destroyed or diminished; for as long as the race of mankind shall last, the revenues likewise of the temple will always be preserved, being coeval in their duration with the universal world. For it is commanded that all men shall every year bring their first fruits to the temple, from twenty years old and upwards; and this contribution is called their ransom.  . . . On which account they bring in the first fruits with exceeding cheerfullness, being joyful and delighted, inasmuch as simultaneously with their making the offering they are sure to find either a relaxation from slavery, or a relief from disease, and to receive in all respects a most sure freedom and safety for the future.  . . . XIV. (cont) And since the nation [of Jews] is the most numerous of all peoples, it follows naturally that the first fruits contributed by them must also be most abundant. Accordingly there is in almost every city a storehouse for the sacred things to which it is customary for the people to come and there to deposit their first fruits, and at certain seasons there are sacred ambassadors selected on account of their virtue, who convey the offerings to the temple.  . . . XIV. (cont) And the most eminent men of each tribe are elected to this office [of bringing the first fruits], that they may conduct the hopes of each individual safe to their destination; for in the Lawful offering of the first fruits are the hopes of the pious.  location 20233

And these things are the emblems of earth and of water; the flowers are the emblems of the earth, inasmuch as it is out of it that they all rise and derive strength to bloom. And the pomegranates (the Greek for a pomegranate is rhoia, or rhoiskos, which Philo imagines to be derived from rheoµ, "to flow") as above mentioned are the emblems of water, being so named from the flowing of the stream.

There is also a third symbol contained in this sacred dress, which it is important not to pass over in silence. For the priests of other deities are accustomed to offer up prayers and sacrifices solely for their own relations, and friends, and fellow citizens. But the high priest of the Jews offers them up not only on behalf of the whole race of mankind, but also on behalf of the different parts of nature, of the earth, of water, of air, and of fire; and pours forth his prayers and thanksgivings for them all, looking upon the world (as indeed it really is) as his country, for which, therefore, he is accustomed to implore and propitiate its governor by supplications and prayers, beseeching him to give a portion of his own merciful and humane nature to the things which he has created.  location 20292

in short, therefore, we must look upon the use of wine to be a most unprofitable thing for all the purposes of life, inasmuch as by it the soul is weighed down, the outward senses are dimmed, and the body is enervated. For it does not leave anyone of our faculties free and unembarrassed, but is a hindrance to everyone of them, so as to impede its attaining that object to which it is by nature fitted.  . . . On which account it probably is that it is commanded to the priest to offer up sacrifices without wine, in order to make a difference and distinction between sacred and profane things, and pure and impure things, and lawful and unlawful things.  location 20308

XIX. But since the priest was a man before he was a priest, and since he is of necessity desirous to indulge the appetites which prompt him to seek for the connections of love, he procures for him a marriage with a pure virgin, and one who is born of pure parents, and grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, selected for their excellency with reference both to their virtue and to their noble birth. For God does not allow him even to look upon a harlot, or a profane body or soul,  . . . XIX. (cont) For it would be mere folly that some men should be excluded from the priesthood by reason of the scars which exist on their bodies from ancient wounds, which are the emblem of misfortune indeed, but not of wickedness; but that those persons who, not at all out of necessity but from their own deliberate choice, have made a market of their beauty, when at last they slowly repent, should at once after leaving their lovers become united to priests, and should come from brothels and be admitted into the sacred precinct. . . . XIX. (cont) For the scars and impressions of their old offences remain not the less in the souls of those who repent. On which account it is wisely and truly said in another passage, that "One may not bring the hire of a harlot into the temple" (Deuteronomy 23:18). And yet the money is not in itself liable to any reproach, except by reason of the woman who received it, and the action for which it was given to her. How then could one possibly admit those women to consort with priests whose very money is looked upon as profane and base, even though as to its material and stamp it may be good and lawful money?  location 20317

XX. The regulations, therefore, are laid down with precision in this manner for the high priest, so that he is not allowed either to marry a widow, nor one who is left desolate after the death of the man to whom she has been espoused, nor one who has been divorced from a husband who is still alive, in order that the sacred seed may be sown for the first time in a field which is hitherto untrodden and pure, and that his offspring may have no admixture of the blood of any other house.  . . . XX. (cont) may easily form their dispositions and characters in a virtuous manner. For the minds of virgins are easily attracted and drawn over to virtue, being exceedingly ready to be taught. But the woman who has had experience of another husband is very naturally less inclined to obedience and to instruction, inasmuch as she has not a soul perfectly pure, like thoroughly smooth wax, so as to receive distinctly the doctrines which are to be impressed upon it, but one which is to a certain degree rough from the impressions which have been already stamped upon it, which are difficult to be effaced, and so remain,  . . . XX. (cont) Let the high priest, therefore, take a pure virgin to be his wife; I say a virgin, meaning not only one with whom no other man has even been connected, but one in connection with whom no other man has ever been named in reference to the agreement of marriage, even though her body may be pure.  location 20334

XXI. (108) But besides this, injunctions are given to the particular and inferior priests concerning their marriages, which are the very same in most points, which are given to those who have the supreme priesthood. But they are permitted with impunity to marry not only maidens but widows also; not, indeed, all widows, but those whose husbands are dead. For the Law thinks it fitting to remove all quarrels and disputes from the life of the priests. And if they had husbands living there very likely might be disputes from the jealousy which is caused by the love of men for women. But when the first husband is dead, then with him the hostility which could be felt towards the second husband dies also. (109) And even on other accounts he might have thought that the high priest ought to be of superior purity and holiness, as in other matters so also in the connection of marriage, and on this account it may have been that God only allowed the high priest to marry a virgin. But to the priests of the second rank he remitted something of the rigor of his regulations concerning the connection with women, permitting them to marry women who have made trials of other husbands    location 20343   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.21

{Lev 21:7-10; High Priest, Jewish}
XXII. And besides these commands, he also defined precisely the family of the women who might be married by the high priest, commanding him to marry not merely a woman who was a virgin, but also one who was a priestess, the daughter of a priest, that so both bridegroom and bride might be of one house,  location 20345   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.22

{Lev 21:1-4; High Priest, Jewish; Priests, Jewish}
commanding them not to permit themselves to be defiled in respect of all people whatsoever, who might happen to die, and who might be connected with them through some bond of friendship, or distant relationship: but allowing them to mourn for six classes only, their fathers or their mothers, their sons of their daughters, their brothers or their sisters, provided that these last were virgins; but the high priest he absolutely forbade to mourn in any case whatever;  location 20353   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.22

{Lev 21:1-4; High Priest, Jewish}
but there is no one besides the high priest himself, who is permitted to perform his duties instead of him; for which reason, he must always be kept free from all defilement, never touching any dead body, in order that, being always ready to offer up prayers and sacrifices on behalf of the whole world at suitable seasons, he may continue to fulfil the duties of his office without hindrance. And otherwise too, besides this consideration, the man who has been assigned to God, and who has become the leader of his sacred band of worshippers, ought to be disconnected with, and alienated from, all things of creation, not being so much the slave of the love of either parents, or children, or brothers, as either to omit or to delay anyone of those holy actions, which it is by all means better should be done at once;  location 20358

{Lev 22:10; Priests, Jewish}
XXIV. And let the sojourner in the priest's house, and the hire hand, be prevented from approaching the first fruits; the sojourner, because it is not everyone who is a neighbor who shares a man's hearth and eats at his table; (Leviticus 22:10), for there is reason to fear that some such person may cast away what is hallowed,  . . . XXIV. (cont) For if in merchant vessels the sailors were to receive an equal share with the pilot of the ship, and if in ships of war the rowers and the mariners were to receive an equal share with the captain, and if in military camps the cavalry of the line were to receive an equal share with their officers, the heavy armed infantry with their colonels, and the colonels with the generals; again, if in cities the parties before the court were to be placed on the same footing with the judges, the committeemen with the ministers, and in short private individuals with the magistrates, there would be incessant troubles and seditions, and the equality in words would produce inequality in fact; for it is an unequal measure to give equal honor to persons who are unequal in rank or desert; and inequality is the root of all evil.  . . . XXIV. (cont) On which account one must not give the honors of the priests to sojourners, . . . for the honor does not belong to the house, but to the race.  location 20390

{Lev 22:10-11; Priests, Jewish; 1 Tim 5:18} 
XXV. In like manner, no one must give this sacred honor to a hired hand, as his wages, or as a recompense for his service; for sometimes he who receives it being unholy will employ it for illegitimate purposes, making the honors due to purity of birth common, and profaning all the sacred ceremonies and observances relating to the temple; on which account the Law altogether forbids any foreigner to partake in any degree of the holy things, even if he be a man of the noblest birth among the natives of the land, and irreproachable as respects both men and women, . . . as if it were reasonable that the priests should be worn out with labors and toils, and nightly and daily cares, but that the rewards for such pains should be common and open to those who do nothing.  . . . XXV. (cont) But, he proceeds, let the priest who is his master give to the slave who is born in his house, and to him who has been purchased with money, a share of meat and drink from the first fruits. In the first place, because the master is the only source of supply to the servant, and the inheritance of the master are the sacred offices of humanity, by which the slave must necessarily be supported. In the second place, because it is by all means necessary that they should not do what is to be done unwillingly; and servants, even though we may not like it, since they are always about us and living with us, preparing meat, and drink, and delicacies for their masters beforehand, and standing at their tables, and carrying away the fragments that are left, even though they may not take any openly, will at all events secretly appropriate some of the victuals, being compelled by necessity to steal, so that instead of one injury (if indeed it is an injury to their masters that they should be supported at their expense), they are compelled to add a second to it, namely, theft; in order that, like thieves, they may enjoy what has been consecrated by their masters who live irreproachably themselves; which is the most unreasonable thing possible.  . . . XXV. (cont) Thirdly, one ought to take this also into consideration, that share of the first fruits will not be neglected merely because they are distributed to the servants, through their fear of their masters; for this is sufficient to stop their mouths, preventing the arrogance of such persons from showing itself.  location 20408

XXVI. If, says he, the daughter of a priest, having married a man who is not a priest, becomes a widow by the death of her husband, or if she be left childless while he is still alive, let her return again to her father's house, to receive her share of the first fruits which she enjoyed when she was a virgin; (Leviticus 22:12), for in some degree and in effect she is now also a virgin, since she has neither husband nor children, and has no other refuge but her father; but if she has sons or daughters, then the mother must of necessity be classed with the children; and the sons and daughters, being ranked as of the family of their father, draw their mother also with them into his house.  location 20411

The law did not allot any share of the land to the priests, . . . for the sake of two objects, both that of doing them the highest honor, since they are thus made partners in those things which are offered up by pious men, out of gratitude to God; and also in order that they might have no business about which to trouble themselves except the offices of religion, as they would have had, if they were forced to take care of their inheritance.  location 20419

XXVII. (cont) and it follows of necessity, that the first fruits offered by the most populous of nations must be very plentiful, so that even the very poorest of the priests, must, in respect of his abundance of all necessary food, appear to be very wealthy. . . . XXVII. (cont) In the second place, he commands the nation also to give them the first fruits of their other possessions; a portion of wine out of each winepress; and of wheat and barley from each threshing floor.  . . . XXVII. (cont) And in like manner they were to have a share of oil from all; the olive trees, and of eatable fruit from all the fruit trees, in order that they might not pass a squalid existence, having only barely enough of necessary food to support life, but that they might have sufficient for a certain degree of comfort and luxury, and so live cheerfully on abundant means,  location 20430

(cont) but he orders that money shall be given as a ransom for the young of other animals, such as horses, and asses and camels, and similar beasts, without disparaging their real value;  . . . XXVII. (cont) and the supplies thus afforded them are very great; for the people of this nation breed sheep, and cattle, and flocks of all kinds above all other peoples, separating them with great care into flocks of goats, and herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep, and a vast quantity of other troops of animals of all kinds.  location 20437

XXVII. (cont) And with reference to the dedication of the first-born male children, in order that the parents may not be separated from their children, nor the children from their parents, he values the first fruits of them himself at a fixed price in money ordering everyone both poor and rich to contribute an equal sum, not having any reference to the ability of the contributors, nor to the vigor or beauty of the children who were born; but considering how much even a very poor man might be able to give; for since the birth of children happens equally to the most noble and to the most obscure persons of the race, he thought it just to enact that their contribution should also be equal, . . . particularly to fix a sum which should be in the power of everyone to give.  location 20453

XXVIII. (141) After this he also appointed another source of revenue of no insignificant importance for the priests, bidding them to take the first fruits of everyone of the revenues of the nation namely, the first fruits of the corn, and wine, and oil, and even of the produce of all the cattle, of the flocks of sheep, and herds of oxen, and flocks of goats, and of all other animals of all kinds; and how great an abundance of these animals there must be, anyone may conjecture from the vast populousness of the nation; (142) from all which circumstances it is plain thq at the Law invests the priests with the dignity and honor that belongs to kings; since he commands contributions from every description of possession to be given to them as to rulers; and they are accordingly given to them in a manner quite contrary to that in which cities usually furnish them to their rulers; for cities usually furnish them under compulsion, and with great unwillingness and lamentation, looking upon the collectors of the taxes as common enemies and destroyers, and making all kinds of different excuses at different times, and neglecting all laws and ordinances, and with all this jumbling and evasion do they contribute the taxes and payments which are levied on them.  . . . XXVIII. (cont) But the men of this nation contribute their payments to the priests with joy and cheerfullness, anticipating the collectors, and cutting short the time allowed for making the contributions, and thinking that they are themselves receiving rather than giving; and so with words of blessing and thankfullness, they all, both men and women, bring their offerings at each of the seasons of the year, with a spontaneous cheerfullness, and readiness, and zeal, beyond all description.  location 20463

XXIX. (145) And these things are assigned to the priests from the possessions of each individual, but there are also often especial revenues set apart for them exceedingly suitable for the priests, which are derived from the sacrifices which are offered up; for it is commanded that two portions from two limbs of every victim shall be given to the priests, the arm from the limb on the right side, and the fat from the chest; for the one is a symbol of strength and manly vigour, and of every lawful action in giving, and taking, and acting: and the other is an emblem of human gentleness as far as the angry passions are concerned; . . . XXIX. (cont) But from the victims which are sacrificed away from the altar, in order to be eaten, it is commanded that three portions should be given to the priest,  location 20473

{Lev 7:8; Priests, Jewish} 
XXX. (cont) And beyond all these things he also orders that the priests who minister the offering of the sacrifices, shall receive the skins of the whole burnt offerings (and they amount to an unspeakable number, this being no slight gift, but one of the most exceeding value and importance), from which circumstances it is plain, that although he has not given to the priesthood a portion of land as its inheritance, in the same manner that he has to others, he has yet assigned to them a more honorable and more untroubled share than any other tribe,  location 20488   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.30

{Ex 34:26; Deut 26:10-13}
XXX. (cont) he commands that the first fruits should first of all be carried into the temple, and then orders that the priests shall take them out of the temple; for it was suitable to the nature of God, that those who had received kindness in all the circumstances of life, should bring the first fruits as thank-offering, and then that he, as a being who was in want of nothing, should with all dignity and honor bestow them on the servants and ministers who attend on the service of the temple; for to appear to receive these things not from men, but from the great Benefactor of all men, appears to be receiving a gift which has in it no alloy of sadness.  location 20493

XXXI. Since, then, these honors are put forth for them, if any of the priests are in any difficulty while living virtuously and irreproachably, they are at once accusers of us as disregarding the Law, even though they may not utter a word.  . . . XXXI. (cont) For if we were to obey the commands which we have received, and if we were to take care to give the first fruits as we are commanded, the priests would not only have abundance of all necessary things, but would also be filled with all kinds of supplies calculated for enabling them to live in refinement and luxury.  . . . XXXI. (cont) But the neglect of some persons (for it is not safe to blame everyone) is the cause of poverty to those who have been dedicated to God [i.e., Levites and priests], and, if one must tell the truth, to the men themselves also.  location 20504

Having given all these supplies and revenues to the priests, he did not neglect those either who were in the second rank of the priesthood; and these are the keepers of the temple, of whom some are placed at the doors, at the very entrance of the temple, as door-keepers; and others are within, in the vestibule of the temple, in order that no one who ought not to do so might enter it, either deliberately or by accident.  location 20507

Others, again, had charge of the porticoes and of the courts in the open air, and carried out all the rubbish, taking care of the cleanliness of the temple, and the tenths were assigned as the wages of all these men; for these tenths are the share of the keepers of the temple.  . . . XXXII. (cont) At all events the Law did not permit those who received them to make use of them, until they had again offered up as first fruits other tenths as if from their own private property, and before they had given these to the priests of the superior rank, for then it permitted them to enjoy them,  location 20513

For as it was not consistent with holiness for one who had by any means whatever become the cause of death to any human being to come within the sacred precincts, using the temple as a place of refuge and as an asylum, Moses gave a sort of inferior sanctity to the cities above mentioned, allowing them to give great security, by reason of the privileges and honors conferred upon the inhabitants,  location 20518

XXXIII. (162) Of the creatures which are fit to be offered as sacrifices, some are land animals, and some are such as fly through the air. Passing over, therefore, the infinite varieties of birds, God chose only two classes out of them all, the turtledove and the pigeon; because the pigeon is by nature the most gentle of all those birds which are domesticated and gregarious, and the turtle-dove the most gentle of those which love solitude.  location 20533

XXXIII. (cont) Also, passing over the innumerable troops of land animals, whose very numbers it is not easy to ascertain, he selected these especially as the best--the oxen, and sheep, and goats; for these are the most gentle and the most manageable of all animals. At all events, great herds of oxen, and numerous flocks of goats and sheep, are easily driven by anyone, not merely by any man, but by any little child, when they go forth to pasture,  . . . And of this gentleness, there are many other proofs, and the most evident are these: that they all feed on herbage, and that no one of them is carnivorous, and that they have neither crooked talons, nor any projecting tusks or teeth whatever;  . . . besides these facts, they are of all animals the most useful to man. Rams are the most useful for the necessary covering of the body; oxen, for plowing the ground and preparing the arable land for seed, and for the growth of the crops that shall hereafter come to be threshed out, in order that men may partake of and enjoy food; and the hair and fleeces of goats, where one is woven, or the other sewn together, make movable tents for travelers, and especially for men engaged in military expeditions,  location 20541

XXXIV. So great is the caution used with respect not only to those who offer the sacrifices, but also to the victims which are offered, that the most eminent of the priests are carefully selected to examine whether they have any blemishes or not, and scrutinize them from head to foot, inspecting not only those parts which are easily visible, but all those which are more out of sight, such as the belly and the thighs, lest any slight imperfection should escape notice. And the accuracy and minuteness of the investigation is directed not so much on account of the victims themselves, as in order that those who offer them should be irreproachable;  . . . for God designed to teach the Jews by these figures, whenever they went up to the altars, when there to pray or to give thanks, never to bring with them any weakness or evil passion in their soul, but to endeavor to make it wholly and entirely bright and clean, without any blemish, so that God might not turn away with aversion from the sight of it.  location 20550

XXXVI. After the Lawgiver has given these commands with reference to these subjects, he begins to distinguish between the different kinds of sacrifices, and he divides the victims into three classes. The most important of which he makes a whole burnt offering; the next an offering for preservation; the last, a sin-offering.  location 20585

enjoining that what is offered to the all-perfect and absolute God must be itself entire and perfect, having no taint of mortal selfishness in it. But that sacrifice which is offered for the sake of men, since its appearance admits of distinction, the Law has distinguished also, appointing it to be a sacrifice for the participation in blessings which mankind has enjoined, and calling it a thank-offering for their preservation.  location 20595   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.36

{Lev 4:1-3}
And for the deliverance from evils it has allotted the sacrifice called a sin-offering, so that these are very appropriately their sacrifices for these causes; the whole burnt-offering being sacrificed for God himself alone, who must be honored for his own sake, and not for that of any other being or thing; and the others for our sake; the thank-offering for our preservation, for the safety and amelioration of human affairs; and the sin-offering for the cure of those offences which the soul has committed.  location 20598   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.36

{Lev 1:3; Lev 1:10}
And the words employed are visible symbols of what is invisible and uncertain. Now the victim which is to be sacrificed as a whole burnt offering must be a male, because a male is both more akin to domination than a female and more nearly related to the efficient cause; for the female is imperfect, subject, seen more as the passive than as the active partner. And since the elements of which our soul consists are two in number, the rational and the irrational part, the rational part belongs to the male sex, being the inheritance of intellect and reason; but the irrational part belongs to the sex of woman, which is the lot also of the outward senses. And the mind is in every respect superior to the outward sense, as the man is to the woman; who, when he is without blemish and purified with the proper purifications, namely, the perfect virtues, is himself the most holy sacrifice, being wholly and in all respects pleasing to God.  location 20609

and, in the second place, that his life shall consist of most virtuous actions, so that, in conjunction with the imposition of hands, the man may speak freely out of his clean conscience, and may say, "These hands have never received any gift as a bribe to commit an unjust action, nor any division of what has been obtained by rapine or by covetousness, nor have they shed innocent blood. nor have they wrought mutilation, nor works of insolence, nor acts of violence, nor have they inflicted any wounds; nor, in fact, have they performed any action whatever which is liable to accusation or to reproach, but have been ministers in everything which is honorable and advantageous, and which is honored by wisdom, or by the Laws, or by honorable and virtuous men."  location 20619

And if ever you give thanks for men and their fortunes, do not do so only for the race taken generally, but you shall give thanks also for the species and most important parts of the race, such as men and women, Greeks and barbarians, men on the continent, and those who have their habitation in the islands; and if you are giving thanks for one individual, do not divide your thankfullness in expression into gratitude for minute trifles and inconsiderable matters, but take in your view the most comprehensive circumstances, first of all, his body and his soul, of which he consists, and then his speech, and his mind, and his outward senses; for such gratitude cannot of itself be unworthy of being listened to by God, when uttered, for each of these particulars.  location 20651

{Lev 7:11} LXX
[*What is the sacrifice of "preservation"?? In it you asked what was the "sacrifice of preservation"?  The expression may not appear in the Masoretic text. In the LXX, Lev. 7:11 speaks of the "sacrifice of soterion"  Yonge translates this as the "sacrifice of preservation." The NETS translation calls it the "sacrifice of deliverance."  For some reason, the Orthodox Study Bible follows the NKJV here and translates it as "sacrifice of peace offering."]

We must now proceed in due order to consider that offering which is called the sacrifice for preservation;  location 20657

{Lev 3:4; Lev 8:16; Lev 9:10; Heb 10:3}  
when it is slain, these three parts are especially selected for the altar, the fat, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys; and all the other parts are left to make a feast for the one making the sacrifice; and we must consider with great accuracy the reason why these portions of the entrails are in this case looked upon as sacred, and not pass this point by carelessly. . . . for it would be folly to suppose that sacrifices were not to procure a forgetfullness of offenses, but were to act as a reminder of them. . . . the fat is brought because it is the richest part, and that which guards the entrails; for it envelops them and makes them to flourish,  . . . And the kidneys are commanded to be selected on account of the adjacent parts and the organs of generation, which they, as they dwell near them, . . . 
for they are channels resembling blood, by which that part of the purification of the superfluities of the body which is moist is separated from the body;  location 20677   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.38

{Lev 3:4; Lev 8:16; Lev 9:10}
And the lobe of the liver is the first fruit of the most important of the entrails, by means of which the food is digested, and being conveyed into the stomach . . . And the liver has a twofold power, a secretive one, and also a power of making blood. Now the secretive power secretes everything which is hard and difficult to be digested,  location 20684

{Lev 1:8-9; Lev 2:2; Rom 12:1}
XL. (cont) for the sacrifice when once placed on the altar, is no longer the property of the person who has offered it, but belongs to that Being to whom the victim is sacrificed, who, being a beneficent and bounteous God, makes the whole company of those who offer the sacrifice, . . . admonishing them not to look upon it as their own feast, for they are but stewards of the feast, and not the entertainers;  location 20701   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.40

{Lev 7:11; 1 Thess 5:23}
XL. (cont) Lastly, this command was given because it so happens that the sacrifice for preservation is offered up for two things, the soul and the body, . . . so that in the first day we should, together with our eating of the food, receive a recollection of the salvation of our souls; and on the second day be reminded of the sound health of our bodies.  location 20706

{Isa 1:11; Mal 1:6-8; Isa 66:3; Ps 50:8-10}
XL. (cont) and he declares that the man who has merely tasted of it is blamable, saying to him, "Though thinking that you were sacrificing, O foolish man, you have not sacrificed; I have not accepted the unholy, unconsecrated, profane, unclean meats which you have roasted, O gluttonous man; never, even in a dream, having a proper idea of sacrifice."  location 20710   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.40

{Lev 7:12; Heb 13:15; Lev 19:1}
XLI. To this species of sacrifice for preservation that other sacrifice also belongs, which is called the sacrifice of praise, and which rests on the following principle (Leviticus 19:1). The man who has never fallen into any unexpected disaster whatever, neither as to his body nor as to his external circumstances, but who has passed a tranquil and peaceful life, living in happiness and prosperity, being free from all calamity and all mishap, steering through the long voyage of life in calmness and serenity of circumstances, good fortune always blowing upon the stern of his vessel, is, of necessity, bound to requite God, who has been the pilot of his voyage, who has bestowed upon him untroubled salvation and unalloyed benefits, and, in short, all sorts of blessings unmingled with any evil, with hymns, and songs, an prayers, and also with sacrifices, and all other imaginable tokens of gratitude in a holy manner; all which things taken together have received the one comprehensive name of praise.  location 20712   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.41

{Lev 4:1-3; Lev 5:1-4}
XLII. We must now proceed, in due order, to consider the third sacrifice, which is called the sin-offering.  . . . XLII. (cont) The sins therefore of the high priest, and of the whole nation, are atoned for by animals of equal value, for the priest is commanded to offer up a calf for each. The sins of the ruler are atoned for by an inferior animal, but still a male, for a kid is the appointed victim. The sins of the private individual by a victim of an inferior species, for it is a female, not a male, a she-goat, that is sacrificed; (229) for it was fitting that a ruler should be ranked above a private individual, even in his performance of sacred ceremonies also: but the nation is superior to the ruler, since the whole must, at all times, be superior to the part. But the high priest is accounted worthy of the same honor as the whole nation, in respect of purification and of entreating a forgiveness of his sins from the merciful power of God. And he receives an equality of honor, not so much as it appears for his own sake, as because he is a servant of the nation, offering up a common thank-offering for them all in his most sacred prayers and most holy sacrifices.   location 20727   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.42

{Lev 4:1-2; 1 Pet 1:15-16; Heb 7:26; Heb 9:7}
XLII. (cont) And the commandment given respecting these matters is one of great dignity and admirable solemnity. "If," says the Law, "the high priest have sinned unintentionally," and then it adds, "so that the people has sinned too," all but affirming in express words that the true high priest, not the one incorrectly called so, has no participation in sin; and if ever he stumble, this will happen to him, not for his own sake, but for the common errors of the nation,  location 20734   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.42

{Lev 5:15-16; Heb 9:7}
XLIII. (234) But since, of offenses some are committed against men, and some against holy and sacred things; he has hitherto been speaking with reference to those which are unintentionally committed against men; but for the purification of such as have been committed against sacred things he commands a ram to be offered up, after the offender has first paid the value of the thing to which the offense related, adding one fifth to the exact value. 
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.43

{Lev 7:1-3; Lev 6:9-11}
XLIII. (cont) And we must take notice that the parts of the victim slain as a sin-offering which are placed upon the altar, are the same as those which are taken from the sacrifice for preservation, namely the lobe of the liver, and the fat, and the kidneys; for in a manner we may speak also of the man who repents as being preserved, since he is cured of a disease of the soul, which is worse than the diseases of the body; (240) but the other parts of the animal are assigned to be eaten in a different manner; and the difference consists in three things; in the place, and time, and in those who receive it. (Leviticus 6:9). . . . Now the place is the temple; the time is one day instead of two; and the persons who partake of it are the priests, and the male servants of the priests, but not the men who offer the sacrifice.  location 20770   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.43

{Lev 6:9; Lev 7:15; Priests, Jewish} 
XLIV. And the Law orders the priests to feast on what is offered in the sacrifice for many reasons; first of all, that by this command it may do honor to him who has offered the sacrifice, for the dignity of those who eat of the feast is an honor to those who furnish it; secondly, that they may believe the more firmly that those men who feel repentance for their sins do really have God propitious to them, for he would never have invited his servants and ministers to a participation in such a banquet, if his forgiveness of those who provided it had not been complete; and thirdly, because it is not lawful for anyone of the priests to bear a part in the sacred ceremonies who is not perfect, for they are rejected for the slightest blemish.  . . . And it is for this reason that the victim sacrificed as a sin-offering is consumed in one day, because men ought to delay to sin, being always slow and reluctant to approach it, but to exert all possible haste and promptness in doing well.  location 20782   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.44

{Num 6:2-4; Nazarites}
XLV. Having given these commandments about every description of sacrifice in its turn, namely, about the burnt offering, and the sacrifice for preservation, and the sin-offering, he adds another kind of offering common to all the three, in order to show that they are friendly and connected with one another; and this combination of them all is called the great vow [i.e. Nazarite]; and why it received this appellation we must now proceed to say.  location 20792   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.45

{Num 6:2-4; Rom 12:1; Nazarites}
XLV. (cont) and when they have no longer any materials left in which they can display their piety, they then consecrate and offer up themselves, displaying an unspeakable holiness, and a most superabundant excess of a God-loving disposition, on which account such a dedication is fitly called the great vow; forevery man is his own greatest and most valuable possession, and this even he now gives up and abandons.  location 20797   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.45

{Num 6:2-4; Lev 10:9; Nazarites}
XLV. (cont) And when a man has vowed this vow the Law gives him the following command; first of all, to touch no unmixed wine, nor any wine that is made of the grape, nor to drink any other strong drink whatever, to the destruction of his reason, considering that during this period his reason also is dedicated to God; for all which could tend to drunkenness is forbidden to those of the priests who are employed in the sacred ministrations, they being commanded to quench their thirst with water; in the second place they are commanded not to show their heads, giving thus a visible sign to all who see them that they are not debasing the pure coinage of their vow; thirdly, they are commanded to keep their body pure and undefiled, so as not even to approach their parents if they are dead, nor their brothers;  location 20800   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.45

{Num 6:13-15; Rom 3:23; Nazarites}
XLVI. But when the appointed time for their being released (Numbers 6:14), from this vow has arrived, the Law then commands the man who has dedicated himself to bring three animals to procure his release from his vow, a male lamb, and a female lamb, and a ram; the one for a burnt offering, the second for a sin-offering, and the ram as a sacrifice for preservation; for in some sense the man who has made such a vow resembles all these things.  . . . He resembles the sacrifice of the entire burnt offering, because he is dedicating to his preserver not only a portion of the first fruits of other things, but also of his own self. And he resembles the sin-offering, inasmuch as he is a man; for there is no one born, however perfect he may be, who can wholly avoid the commission of sin. He resembles also the offering for preservation, inasmuch as he has recorded that God the Savior is the cause of his preservation, and does not ascribe it to any physician or to any power of his;  location 20810   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.46

{Medicine, Ancient}
XLVI. (cont) Medicine does not benefit all persons, nor does it always benefit the same persons; but there are times even when it does them great injury, since its power depends on different things, both on the thing itself and also on those persons who use it.  location 20815   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.46

{Num 6:18}
XLVI. (cont) But since the man has begun to offer himself as his first fruits, and since it is not lawful for the sacred altar to be polluted with human blood, but yet it was by all means necessary that a portion should be consecrated, he has taken care to take a portion, which, being taken, should cause neither pain nor defilement; for he has cut off (Numbers 6:18), the hair of the head, the superfluities of the natural body, as if they were the superfluous branches of a tree, and he has committed them to the fire on which the meat of the sacrifice offered for preservation will be suitably prepared, (Leviticus 6:13) in order that some portion of the man who has made the vow, which it is not lawful to place upon the altar, may still at all events be combined with the sacrifice, burning the fuel of the sacred flame.  location 20821   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.46

{Lev 6:20-21; Heb 7:27}
XLVII. (255) These sacred fires are common to all the rest of the people. But it was fitting that the priests also should offer up something on the altar as first fruits, not thinking that the services and sacred ministrations to which they have been appointed have secured them an exemption from such duties. And the first fruits suitable for the priests to offer do not come from anything containing blood, but from the purest portion of human food; for the fine wheat flour is their continual offering; a tenth part of a sacred measure every day; one half of which is offered up in the morning, and one half in the evening, having been soaked in oil, so that no portion of it can be left for food;  location 20827   
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.47

XLVIII. (257) The law chooses that a person who brings a sacrifice shall be pure, both in body and soul; --pure in soul from all passions, and diseases, and vices, which can be displayed either in word or deed; and pure in body from all such things as a body is usually defiled by. (258) . . . What, then, is the mode of purifying the soul? "Look," says the Law, "take care that the victim which you bringt to the altar is perfect, wholly without participation in any kind of blemish, selected from many on account of its excellence

{Num 19:1-3; Mt 3:11}
XLIX. (262) We must consider what great prudence and philosophical wisdom is displayed in this law; for nearly all other persons are besprinkled with pure water, generally in the sea, some in rivers, and others again in vessels of water which they draw from fountains. But Moses, having previously prepared ashes which had been left from the sacred fire (and in what manner shall be explained hereafter), appointed that it should be right to take some of them and to put them in a vessel, and then to pour water upon them, and then, dipping some branches of hyssop in the mixture of ashes and water, to sprinkle it over those who were to be purified. (263) And the cause of this proceeding may very probably be said to be this:--The lawgiver's intention is that those who approach the service of the living God should first of all know themselves and their own essence. For how can the man who does not know himself ever comprehend the supreme and all-excelling power of God? (264) Therefore, our bodily essence is earth and water, of which he reminds us by this purification, conceiving that this result--namely, to know one's self, and to know also of what one is composed, of what utterly valueless substances mere ashes and water are--is of itself the most beneficial purification. (265) For when a man is aware of this he will at once reject all vain and treacherous conceit, and, discarding haughtiness and pride, he will seek to become pleasing to God
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.49

{Num 19:1-3}
L. (267) But now it is necessary to fulfil our promise and to explain the peculiar propriety involved in this use of ashes. For they are not merely the ashes of wood which has been consumed by fire, but also of an animal particularly suited for this kind of purification. For the Law orders that a red heifer, which has never been brought under the yoke, shall be sacrificed outside of the city, and that the high priest, taking some of the blood, shall seven times sprinkle with it all the things in front of the temple, and then shall burn the whole animal, with its hide and flesh, and with the belly full of all the entrails. And when the flame begins to pour down, then it commands that these three things shall be thrown into the middle of it, a stick of cedar, a stick of hyssop, and a bunch of saffron; and then, when the fire is wholly extinguished, it commands that some man who is clean shall collect the ashes, and shall again place them outside of the city in some open place. (269) And what figurative meanings he conceals under these orders as symbols, we have accurately explained in another treatise,
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.50

{Ex 25:8-10; Ex 27:1-3}
LI. (273) And that this statement is true, and not mine but that of nature, is testified to a certain degree by the evident nature of the thing itself, which affords a manifest proof which none can deny who do not cleave to credulity out of a contentious disposition. It is testified also by the Law which commands two altars to be prepared, differing both as to the materials of which they are made, as to the places in which they are erected, and as to the purposes to which they are applied; (274) for one is made of stones, carefully selected so to fit one another, and unhewn, and it is erected in the open air, near the steps of the temple, and it is for the purpose of sacrificing victims which contain blood in them. And the other is made of gold, and is erected in the inner part of the temple, within the first veil, and may not be seen by any other human being except those of the priests who keep themselves pure, and it is for the purpose of offering incense upon; (275) from which it is plain that God looks upon even the smallest offering of frankincense by a holy man as more valuable than ten thousand beasts which may be sacrificed by one who is not thoroughly virtuous.
Philo, The Special Laws I, ch.51

{Deut 23:18; 1 Cor 6:9-10}
LI. (cont)  This injunction also is very admirably and properly set down in the sacred tablets of the Law, that the wages of a harlot are not to be received into the temple, and inasmuch as she has earned them by selling her beauty, having chosen a most infamous life for the sake of shameful gain; (281) but if the gifts which proceed from a woman who has lived as a concubine are unholy, how can those be different which proceed from a soul which is defiled in the same manner, which has voluntarily abandoned itself to shame and to the lowest infamy, to drunkenness and gluttony, and covetousness and ambition, and love of pleasure, and to innumerable other kinds of passions, and diseases, and wickednesses? For what time can be long enough to efface those defilements, I indeed do not know. (282) location 21161

{Deut 23:18; Mt 21:31}
LI. (cont) Very often in truth time has put an end to the occupation of a harlot, since, when women have outlived their beauty, no one any longer approaches them, their prime having withered away like that of some flowers;  . . . and what length of time can ever transform the harlotry of the soul which from its youth has been trained in early and habitual incontinence, so as to bring it over to good order? No time could do this, but God alone, to whom all things are possible, even those which among us are impossible.  location 21167

{Ps 51:16-17; 2 Pet 3:14}
LI. (cont)  Accordingly, the man who is about to offer a sacrifice ought to examine and see, not whether the victim is without blemish, but whether his mind is sound, and entire, and perfect. Let him likewise investigate the causes for which he is about to offer the sacrifice; for it must be as an expression of thankfullness for kindnesses which have been shown to him, or else of supplication for the permanence of his present blessings, or for the acquisition of some future good, or else to avert some evil either present or expected;  . . . LI. (cont)  for if he is giving thanks for benefits conferred upon him, he must take care not to behave like an ungrateful man, becoming wicked, for the benefits are conferred on a virtuous man;  . . . or if he is asking to escape from evils, let him not commit actions deserving of correction and punishment.  location 21176

And the first of these other commandments is not to take the name of God in vain; for the word of the virtuous man, says the law, shall be his oath, firm, unchangeable, which cannot lie, founded steadfastly on truth.

And these men also deserve to be praised who, when they are compelled to swear, by their slowness, and delay, and evasion, cause fear not only to those who see them, but to those also who invite them to take an oath; for when they do pronounce the oath they are accustomed to say only thus much, "By the--;" or, "No, by the--;" without any further addition, giving an emphasis to these words by the mutilation of the usual form, but without uttering the express oath.  . . . However, if a man must swear and is so inclined, let him add, if he pleases, not indeed the highest name of all, and the most important cause of all things, but the earth, the sun, the stars, the heaven, the universal world; for these things are all most worthy of being named, and are more ancient than our own birth, and, moreover, they never grow old, lasting forever and ever, in accordance with the will of their Creator.  location 21280

{Mt 5:33-37; Lev 19:12; Oaths; Ex 20:7; Jas 5:12}
And some men display such easiness and indifference on the subject [of oaths], that, passing over all created things, they dare in their ordinary conversation to rise up to the Creator and Father of the universe, without stopping to consider the place in which they are, whether it be profane or sacred; or the time, whether it be suitable; or themselves, whether they are pure in body and soul; or the business, whether it be important; or the occasion, whether it is necessary;  . . . But now, out of their excessive impiety, they use the most awful names in speaking of the most unimportant matters, and heaping one appellation upon another in a perfect crowd they feel no shame, thinking that by the frequency and number of their uninterrupted oaths they will attain to the object which they desire, being very foolish to think so;  . . . for a great number of oaths is no proof of credibility, but rather of a man's not deserving to be believed in the opinion of men of sense and wisdom.  location 21292   
Philo, The Special Laws II, ch. 2

{Mt 5:33-37; Lev 19:12; Oaths; Ex 20:7; Jas 5:12}
But if anyone being compelled to swear, swears by anything whatever in a manner which the law does not forbid, let him exert himself with all his strength and by every means in his power to give effect to his oath, interposing no hindrance to prevent the accomplishment of the matter thus ratified, especially if neither implacable anger or frenzied love, or unrestrained appetites agitate the mind, so that it does not know what is said or done,  . . . For an oath is nothing else but the testimony of God invoked in a matter which is a subject of doubt, and to invoke God to witness a statement which is not true is the most impious of all things.  . . . For a man who does this, is all but saying in plain words (even though he hold his peace), "I am using you as a veil for my iniquity; do you co-operate with me, who am ashamed to appear openly to be behaving unjustly. For though I am doing wrong, I am anxious not to be accounted wicked, but you canst be indifferent to your reputation with the multitude, having no regard to being well spoken of."  location 21299

A man, therefore, as I have said, must be sure and give effect to all oaths which are taken for honorable  . . . And in this description of oaths those most lawful vows are included which are offered up in consequence of an abundance of blessings, either present or expected; but if any vows are made for contrary objects, it is not holy to ratify them, for there are some men who swear, if chance so prompts them, to commit theft, or sacrilege, or adultery, or rape, or to inflict wounds or slaughter, or any similar acts of wickedness, and who perform them without any delay, making an excuse that they must keep their oaths, as if it were not better and more acceptable to God to do no iniquity, than to perform such a vow and oath as that.  location 21306

But there are some men who, out of the excess of their wicked hatred of their species, being naturally unsociable and inhuman, or else being constrained by anger as by a hard mistress, think to confirm the savageness of their natural disposition by an oath, Oaths that they will not admit this man or that man to sit at the same table with them, or to come under the same roof; or, again, that they will not give any assistance to such a person, or that they will not receive any from him as long as he lives.  location 21318

And yet many men who have before now been placed in situations of great authority, and even many who now are so, though they have most abundant resources of all kinds, and enormous riches, wealth continually and uninterruptedly flowing upon them as if from some unceasing spring, do nevertheless at times turn to the same things which we poor men use, to earthenware cups, and small cheap loaves, and olives, or cheese, or vegetables, for a seasoning to their dinners; and in the summer put on a girdle and a linen garment, and in winter any whole and stout cloak, and for sleep use a bed made on the ground, discarding gladly couches made of ivory or wrought in tortoiseshell and gold, and coverlets of various embroidery, and rich clothes and purple dyes, and the luxury of sweet and elaborate confectionery, and costly viands; and the reason of this conduct is not merely that they have a virtuous and abstemious disposition by nature, but also that they have enjoyed a good education from their earliest youth, which has taught them to honor what belongs to man rather than what belongs to authority,  . . . Therefore such men fill their cities with vigor and abundance, and with good laws and peace, depriving them of no good thing whatever, but providing them with all requisite blessings in the most unlimited and unsparing manner; for this conduct and actions of this sort are the achievements of men of real nobility, and of men who may truly be called governors.  location 21346

{Num 30:3-4; Num 30:8}
But the law takes away from virgins and from married women the power of making vows independently, pronouncing the parents of the one class, and the husbands of the other, their lords; and with reference to any confirmation or disavowal of their oaths, declaring that that power belongs in the one case to the father, and in the other to the husband.  . . . And very reasonably, for the one class by reason of their youth are not aware of the importance of oaths, so that they stand in need of the advice of others to judge for them; while the other class do often out of easiness of disposition take oaths which are not for the interest of their husbands, on which account the law invests the husbands and fathers with authority either to ratify their oaths or to declare them void.  location 21356

{Lev 27:2-8}
But in the case of those persons who have vowed not merely their own property or some part of it, but also their own selves, the law has affixed a price to their vows, not having a regard to their beauty, or their importance, or to anything of that kind, but with reference to the number of the individuals separating the men from the women, and the infants from those who are full grown. For the law ordains (Leviticus 27:3), that from twenty years of age to sixty the price of a man shall be two hundred drachmas of solid silver money, and of a woman a hundred and twenty drachmas. And from five years of age to twenty, the price of a male child is eighty, and of a female child forty drachmas. And from infancy to five years old, the price of a male is twenty; of a female child, twelve drachmas (Leviticus 10:3). And in the case of men who have lived beyond sixty years of age, the ransom of the old men is sixty, and of the old women forty drachmas.  . . . And the law has regulated this ransom with reference to the same age both in men and women on account of three most important considerations. First of all, because the importance of their vow is equal and similar, whether it be made by a person of great or of little importance. Secondly, because it is fitting that those who have made a vow should not be exposed to the treatment of slaves; for they are valued at a high or at a low price, according to the good condition and beauty of their bodies, or the contrary. Thirdly, which, indeed, is the most important consideration of all, because inequality is valued among men, but equality is honored by God.  location 21390

But those who may chance to buy it shall not pay an equal ransom for it; but if the man who has vowed it chooses to ransom it, he shall pay its price and a fifth besides, punishing his own rashness and impetuous desire for his two faults, his rashness for making the vow, and his impetuous desire for wishing for things back again which he had before abandoned.  location 21404

For instance, there is the release of those men who by nature were free, but who, through some unforeseen necessity of the times, have become slaves, which release takes place every seventh year. Again, there is the humanity of creditors towards their debtors, as they forgive their countrymen their debts every seventh year. Also there is the rest given to the fertile ground, whether it be in the champaign or in the mountainous country, which also takes place every seventh year.

(41) Now there are ten festivals in number, as the law sets them down.
The first is that which anyone will perhaps be astonished to hear called a festival. This festival is every day. The second festival is the seventh day, which the Hebrews in their native language call the sabbath. The third is that which comes after the conjunction, which happens on the day of the new moon in each month. The fourth is that of the Passover which is called the Passover. The fifth is the first fruits of the corn--the sacred sheaf.
The sixth is the feast of unleavened bread, after which that festival is celebrated, which is really The seventh day of seventh days. The eighth is the festival of the sacred moon, or the feast of trumpets. The ninth is the fast. The tenth is the feast of tabernacles, which is the last of all the annual festivals, ending so as to make the perfect number of ten. We must now begin with the first festival.

These men, however, are therefore but a small number, kindling in their different cities a sort of spark of wisdom, in order that virtue may not become utterly extinguished, and so be entirely extirpated from our race. But if men everywhere agreed with this small number, and became, as nature originally designed that they should, all blameless and irreproachable, lovers of wisdom, delighting in all that is virtuous and honorable, and thinking that and that alone good, and looking on everything else as subordinate and slaves, as if they themselves were the masters of them, then all the cities would be full of happiness, being wholly free from all the things which are the causes of pain or fear,  . . . the whole circle of the year would be one festival.  location 21467

And the second reason is this, "Be not," says the lawgiver," wholly devoted to gain, but even willingly submit to some loss," that so you may bear with the more indifference involuntary calamity if it should ever fall upon you, and not grieve and despond, as if at some new and strange occurrence; for there are some rich men so unfortunate in their dispositions, as, when want comes upon them, to groan and despond no less than they might do if they were deprived of all their substance.  location 21602

And before now I have heard of some persons who, in their ferocity and unequalled fury, have not spared even the dead; but have been so brutal as even to venture to beat the dead corpses with goads; and when someone blamed their brutality, in that not even death, that relief and real end of all miseries, could prevent their victims from being insulted by them, but that, instead of a grave and the customary funeral rites, they were exposed to continued insult, they made a defense worse even than the accusation brought against them, saying that they were insulting the dead, not for the sake of abusing the dumb and senseless dust, for there was no advantage in that, but for the sake of making those who through ties of blood or of friendship were nearly connected with them feel compassion for them, and so inducing them to pay a ransom for their bodies, thus doing them the last service in their power. . . .

In the first place he gives this commandment. He thinks it fitting that all property that has been alienated should now be restored to its original masters in order that the inheritances originally apportioned to the different tribes may be preserved, and that no one who originally received an allotment may be wholly deprived of his possessions.  . . . for the sale effected ought not to be a sale of the lands owned, but a sale of the crops, for two most weighty reasons; one, that the whole country is called the possession of God, and it is impious for anyone else to be recorded as the masters of the possessions of God; and secondly, because a separate allotment has been assigned to each land-owner,  . . . giving him back his former property with the exception of any fields which have been consecrated by a vow, and are so placed in the class of offerings to God. . . . And it is contrary to divine law that anything which has been offered to God should ever by lapse of time become profane.

(116) These are the commandments which are given with respect to the divisions of the land and the inheritances so portioned out. There are others also enacted with respect to houses.
(Leviticus 25:31), for the houses are a portion of the man's possessions. But those which are within walls shall be liable to be redeemed by those who have sold them for a full year; (Leviticus 25:19.) but if they be not redeemed within that year, then after that year they shall be confirmed to those who had bought them, the jubilee of the fiftieth year not injuring the claim of the purchasers.  . . . And the reason of these enactments is that God wills to give even to strangers an opportunity of becoming firmly established in the land. For since they have no participation in the land, inasmuch as they are not numbered among those to whom the inheritances have been apportioned, the law has allotted to them a property in houses, being desirous that they who have come as suppliants to the laws, and who have taken refuge under their protection, should not be homeless wanderers in the land.  . . . For the cities, when the land was originally portioned out in inheritances, were not divided among the tribes, nor indeed were they originally built together in streets, but the inhabitants of the land preferred to make their abode in their open houses in the fields. But afterwards they quitted these houses and came together, the feeling of a love of fellowship and communication, as was natural, becoming stronger after a lapse of time, and so they built houses in the same place, and cities, of which they allowed a share also to the strangers, that they might not be destitute of everything both in the country and in the cities.  location 21699

But the presiding power must take care to watch over those who are left behind and of their growth and of the expenses for sustenance and the training that is appropriate for girls, and, whenever the time should come, for appropriate marriage, husbands approved in all things having been selected by merit.

But there are some men who after getting married and having children have at length unlearned prudence and drifted into incontinence. Lusting after other women, these men have wronged their first wives and behaved toward their children from them no longer as fathers but as uncles, imitating the impious behavior of stepmothers toward previously born children. They have given themselves and their property over entirely to their new wives and to their sons, having been overcome by pleasure, the most shameful passion. The law would not have hesitated to bridle these lusts somehow if it had been possible, lest they kick up their heels even more; (136) but since it was difficult, or rather impossible, to cure this wild frenzy, the law abandoned the man as being in the grip of an incurable disease. It did not, however, overlook the son of the woman wronged on account of the new love but commanded that he should receive a double share of the distribution left for the brothers. (137) There are many reasons for this. For in the first place it punishes the guilty man by compelling him to do something good for the son whom he has chosen to treat badly; and it makes clear the invalidity of his inconsiderate judgment in that it profits the one who was in danger of suffering loss at his hands by putting itself in the role of the parent--the role abandoned by the natural father with regard to the firstborn son. (138) Secondly, it shows mercy and compassion on those who have been treated unjustly, whose burden of distress it lightens by giving them a share in grace and gift; for the double portion of the inheriting son was no less likely to please the mother, who will be encouraged by the kindness of the law, which did not permit her and her offspring to be totally overcome by their enemies. (139) In the third place, being a good referee of justice, it considered in itself that the father had freely lavished provisions upon the sons of the beloved wife due to his affection for her, while he considered the sons of the hated wife to deserve nothing due to his hatred for their mother. Thus the former had inherited more than their equal share during his lifetime, while the latter were in danger even upon his death of being deprived of the whole patrimony. So then, in order to equalize the distribution to the sons of both wives, it set aside a double portion as the rightful inheritance of the eldest, the son of the wife who had been put away.

THE THIRD FESTIVAL. Following the order which we have adopted, we proceed to speak of the third festival, that of the new moon. First of all, because it is the beginning of the month, and the beginning, whether of number or of time, is honorable. Secondly, because at this time there is nothing in the whole of heaven destitute of light. (141) Thirdly, because at that period the more powerful and important body gives a portion of necessary assistance to the less important and weaker body; for, at the time of the new moon, the sun begins to illuminate the moon with a light which is visible to the outward senses, and then she displays her own beauty to the beholders. And this is, as it seems, an evident lesson of kindness and humanity to men, to teach them that they should never grudge to impart their own good things to others, but, imitating the heavenly bodies, should drive envy away and banish it from the soul.  . . . The fourth reason [for the festival of the new moon] is that of all the bodies in the heaven, the moon traverses the zodiac in the least appointed time: it accomplishes its orbit in a monthly interval. For this reason the law has honored the end of its orbit, the point when the moon has finished at the beginning point from which it began to travel, by having called that day a feast so that it might again teach us an excellent lesson that in the affairs of life we should make the ends harmonious with the beginnings.

THE FOURTH FESTIVAL. And after the feast of the new moon comes the fourth festival, that of the Passover, which the Hebrews call pascha, on which the whole people offer sacrifice, beginning at noonday and continuing till evening. . . . And those who are to share in the feast come together not as they do to other entertainments, to gratify their bellies with wine and meat, but to fulfil their hereditary custom with prayer and songs of praise. (149) And this universal sacrifice of the whole people is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the month, which consists of two periods of seven, in order that nothing which is accounted worthy of honor may be separated from the number seven.  location 21728

THE FIFTH FESTIVAL. And there is another festival combined with the feast of the Passover, having a use of food different from the usual one, and not customary; the use, namely, of unleavened bread, from which it derives its name. And there are two accounts given of this festival, the one peculiar to the nation, on account of the migration already described; the other a common one, in accordance with conformity to nature and with the harmony of the whole world.  location 21744

{Ex 12:2-3; Easter}
Accordingly, every year, God reminds men of the creation of the world, and with this view puts forward the spring, in which season all plants flourish and bloom; for which reason this is very correctly set down in the law as the first month, since, in a manner, it may be said to be an impression of the first beginning of all, being stamped by it as by an archetypal seal. . . . Although the month in which the autumnal equinox occurs is first in sequence according to solar orbits, it is not considered first in the law. . . . Therefore he [Moses] thought that to apply the name "first" to the month in which the hill country and the plain become barren and infertile, was incongruous and unfitting.  location 21755

[Feast of Unleavened Bread] The interpreters of the holy scriptures do also say that the unleavened food is a gift of nature, but that leavened bread is a work of art. Since, therefore, the vernal festival is a commemoration of the creation of the world, and since that it was inevitable that the most ancient persons, those formed out of the earth, must have used the gifts of the world without alteration, pleasure not having as yet obtained the dominion, the lawgiver ordained that food which was the most suitable to the occasion,  . . . [Feast of Unleavened Bread] And this feast is begun on the fifteenth day of the month, in the middle of the month, on the day on which the moon is full of light, in consequence of the providence of God taking care that there shall be no darkness on that day. (156) And, again, the feast is celebrated for seven days, on account of the honor due to that number, in order that nothing which tends to cheerfullness and to the giving of thanks to God may be separated from the holy number seven. (157) And of the seven days, Moses pronounces two, the first and the last, holy; giving, as is natural, a preeminence to the beginning and to the end; and wishing, as if in the case of a musical instrument, to unite the two extremities in harmony. (158) And the unleavened bread is ordained because their ancestors took unleavened bread with them when they went forth out of Egypt, under the guidance of the Deity; or else, because at that time (I mean at the spring season, during which this festival is celebrated) the crop of wheat is not yet ripe, the plains being still loaded with the corn, and it not being as yet the harvest time, and therefore lawgiver has ordained the use of unleavened food with a view to assimilating it to the state of the crops. For unleavened food is also imperfect or unripe, as a memorial of the good hope which is entertained; since nature is by this time preparing her annual gifts for the race of mankind. location 21775

THE SIXTH FESTIVAL.  (162) There is also a festival on the day of the paschal feast, which succeeds the first day, and this is named the sheaf [plural: sheaves], from what takes place on it; for the sheaf is brought to the altar as a first fruit both of the country which the nation has received for its own, and also of the whole land; . . . and the sheaf of the first fruits is barley, calculated for the innocent and blameless use of the inferior animals;  . . . 
it is also not consistent with holiness to enjoy and partake of anything which is given for food, without first giving thanks to that being to whom it is becoming and pious to offer them.  location 21785

{Lev 21:6; 1 Pet 2:9}
A priest has the same relation to a city that the nation of the Jews has to the entire inhabited world. For it serves as a priest. . . . the legislation is in a certain way teaching about the priesthood and that the one who lives by the laws is at once considered a priest, or rather a high priest, in the judgment of truth.
Philo, The Special Laws II, ch.29

{Jer 10:1-3; 1 Cor 8:5-6}
The following point is also remarkable. The multitude of gods, both male and female, honored in individual cities happens to be undetermined and indefinite. The poetic clan and the great company of humans have spoken fabulously about them, people for whom the search for truth is impractical and beyond their capability of investigation. Yet all do not reverence and honor the same gods, but different people different gods. The reason is that they do not consider as gods those belonging to another land but make the acceptance of them the occasion for laughter and a joke. They charge those who honor them with great foolishness since they completely violate sound sense. (165) But if he is, whom all Greeks together with all barbarians acknowledge with one judgment, the highest Father of both gods and humans and the Maker of the entire cosmos, whose nature--although it is invisible and unfathomable not only to sight but also to perception--all who spend their time with mathematics and other philosophy long to discover, leaving aside none of the things which contribute to the discovery and service of him, then it was necessary for all people to cling to him and not as if through some mechanical device to introduce other gods into participation of equal honors. (166) Since they slipped in the most essential matter, the nation of the Jews--to speak most accurately--set aright the false step of others by having looked beyond everything which has come into existence through creation since it is generate and corruptible in nature, and chose only the service of the Ungenerated and Eternal.
Philo, The Special Laws II, ch.29

{Josh 21:43-45; Gen 15:18-21}
They [the Jews] give thanks for themselves for many things. The first is that they are not perpetually wandering here and there among islands and continents and like foreigners and those without a permanent abode who have settled the lands of others and occupy others' wealth are reproached . . ., but have acquired a land and cities and for a long time have been in possession of their own inheritance, for which reason it has been a sacred duty for them to offer the first fruits. (169) The second is that they did not receive a worthless and common land, but a good and fertile land both for the breeding of domestic animals and the abundance of unspeakably great crops. For there is no poor soil in it, and even the parts that seem to be stony and hardened are broken up with soft and especially deep veins which because of their richness are good for crop production. (170) In addition to these things, they did not receive a desolate land, but one in which there was a populous nation and great cities abounding in men. Yet the cities were emptied of their inhabitants and the entire race disappeared except for a small part: some as a result of wars and others as a result of divinely sent attacks because of their new and strange practices of wrongs and all of the impieties they used to commit through their great efforts to demolish the laws of nature.

[The festival of sheaves is a] most just recompense to the real Cause of the fruitfullness. (172) For the things which occur as a result of agricultural skill are few or none at all: to build up furrows, to dig and spade all around a plant, to deepen a trench, to cut off excessive growths, or to perform any similar task. But the things which come from nature are all essential and useful: the most fertile ground, a land well-watered by springs and both spring-fed and seasonal rivers and sprinkled with annual rains, mild temperatures of air moved by breezes which are most conducive for life, countless types of crops and plants. For which of these has a human either discovered or engendered? . . .  [Festival of Sheaves] That portion of the food which was honored with the second place, namely, barley, was ordered by the law to be offered as first fruits; for the first honors were assigned to wheat, of which it has deferred the offering of the first fruits, as being more honorable, to a more suitable season.  location 21780

THE SEVENTH FESTIVAL. The fiftieth day is reckoned, making up the sacred number of seven sevens, with the addition of a unit as a seal to the whole;  . . . [Pentecost]  The feast which takes place on the basis of the number fifty has received the name "the feast of the first produce" since during the feast it is customary to offer up two leavened loaves made of wheat, as a first fruit of the best kind of food made of grain; either because, before the fruit of the year is converted to the use of man, the first produce of the new crop, the first gathered grain that appears is offered as a first fruit, in order that by an insignificant emblem the people may display their grateful disposition; or else because the fruit of wheat is most especially the first and most excellent of all productions.  location 21793   
Philo, The Special Laws II, ch.30

{Lev 2:11; Lev 23:17; Ex 23:18}
[Pentecost] And the bread is leavened because the law forbids anyone to offer unleavened bread upon the altar; not in order that there should be any contradiction in the injunctions given, but that in a manner the giving and receiving may be of one sort; . . . For those for whom it is lawful and permissible will use what has once been consecrated; and it is lawful for those who are consecrated to the priesthood, who have received the right given by the humaneness of the law to share in the things offered on the altar which are not consumed by the unquenchable fire, either as a wage for their services or as a prize for contests in which they compete on behalf of piety or as a sacred allotment in view of the fact that with regard to the land they have not acquired their appropriate part in the same way as the other tribes. (184) And it is permitted to the priests; and the leaven is also an emblem of two others things; first of all of that most perfect and entire food, than which one cannot, among all the things of daily use, find any which is better and more advantageous; and the fruit of wheat is the best of all the things that are sown; so that it is fitting, that that should be offered as the most excellent of first fruits, for the most excellent gift. (185) The second is a more figurative meaning, implying that everything which is leavened is apt to inflate and elate; and joy is an irrational elation of the soul. Now man is not by nature disposed to rejoice at anything that exists more than at an abundant and sufficient supply of necessaries; for which it is very proper to give thanks joyfully, making a display of gratitude, for the invisible happiness affecting the mind, which shall be perceptible to the outward senses through the medium of the leavened loaves; (186) and these first fruits are loaves, not corn, because when there is corn there is no longer anything wanting for the enjoyment of food, for it is said that the wheat is the last of all the grains which are sown to ripen and to come to harvest. (187) And there are thus two most excellent acts of thanksgiving having a reference to two distinct times; to the past, in which we have been saved from experiencing the evils of scarcity and hunger while living in happiness and plenty; and to the future, because we have provided ourselves with supplies and abundant preparations for it. location 21805  
[Kinuko, as my trusted word detective, can you see if you can find out what Philo is referring to when he says "the law forbids anyone to offer unleavened bread upon the altar." I wasn't aware of that. The editor thinks it's a corruption in the ms. But I don't think so, for what Philo says afterward would indicate that he meant just what he said. I wonder if the key is in the word translated "loaf" in the LXX. I notice that the showbread is called artos, which normally means leavened bread. Azumos means unleavened bread. (At least, that is my understanding.)

Dear Brother David. Yes, the showbread is artos and unleavened bread is azumos (still today).

THE EIGHTH FESTIVAL [Feast of Trumpets]. Immediately after comes the festival of the sacred moon; in which it is the custom to play the trumpet in the temple at the same moment that the sacrifices are offered.  . . . as being a commemoration of that most marvelous, wonderful, and miraculous event that took place when the holy oracles of the law were given; for then the voice of a trumpet sounded from heaven,  . . . The trumpet is the instrument of war, sounding both when commanding the charge and the retreat.... the law has given this festival the name of a warlike instrument, in order to show the proper gratitude to God as the giver of peace, who has abolished all seditions in cities, and in all parts of the universe, and has produced plenty and prosperity, not allowing a single spark that could tend to the destruction of the crops to be kindled into flame.  location 21826

THE NINTH FESTIVAL. [Day of Atonement] And after the feast of trumpets the solemnity of the fast is celebrated, and this Moses has called the greatest of the festivals, denominating it in his national language the sabbath of sabbaths, or, as the Greeks would style, it the week of weeks, the most holy of all holy times.  . . . [Day of Atonement] The first reason [that the Day of Atonement is a fast] is the temperance which the lawgiver is continually exhorting men to display at all times, both in their language and in their appetites, both in and below the belly. . . . [The second reason that the Day of Atonement is a fast is because] everyone is at this time occupied in prayers and supplications, and since they all devote their entire leisure to nothing else from morning till evening, except to most acceptable prayers by which they endeavor to gain the favor of God, entreating pardon for their sins and hoping for his mercy, not for their own merits but through the compassionate nature of that Being who will have forgiveness rather than punishment.  . . . The third [reason that the Day of Atonement is a fast] is an account of the time at which this fast is fixed to take place; for by this season all the fruits which the earth has produced during the whole year are gathered in. And therefore to proceed at once to devour what has been produced Moses looked upon as an act of greediness; but to fast, and to abstain from touching food, he considered a mark of perfect piety which teaches the mind not to trust to the food which it may have prepared as the cause of health or life.  location 21839

[Day of Atonement] do almost declare in express words, "We have with joy received, and we shall cheerfully store up the bounteous gifts of nature; but we do not ascribe to any corruptible thing the cause of our own durable existence, but we attribute that to the Savior, to the God who rules in the world, and who is able, either by means of these things or without them, to nourish and to preserve us."  . . . [Day of Atonement] And this day of the fast is celebrated in the tenth month, because the number ten is a perfect number. Therefore God has ordained that abstinence from food should take place in accordance with the perfect number,  . . . [Day of Atonement] preserve a commemoration of their previous scarcity [in the wilderness] by abstinence from food, and should offer up prayers, in order that they might never come to a real experience of a want of necessary food.  location 21853

THE TENTH FESTIVAL. The last of all the annual festivals is that which is called the feast of tabernacles, which is fixed for the season of the autumnal equinox.  . . . [Feast of Tabernacles] And, indeed, the people are commanded to pass the whole period of the feast under tents, either because there is no longer any necessity for remaining in the open air laboring at the cultivation of the land, since there is nothing left in the land, but all ... is stored up in the barns, on account of the injuries which otherwise might be likely to visit it from the burning of the sun or the violence of the rains. (207) For when the crops which provide nourishment are in the fields, you act as a manager and guard of those necessities not by having cooped yourself up like a woman who belongs at home, but by having gone out to the fields. If severe cold or summer heat befalls you as you live in the open air, the overgrowths of the trees are handy shelters. If you get under their protection, you will be able to escape easily the harm from each. But when all the crops are in, go in with them to look for a more substantial abode for rest in place of the toils which you endured as you worked the land. Or again, it may be a reminder of the long journey of our ancestors which they made through a wide desert, living in tents for many years at each station. (208) And it is proper in the time of riches to remember one's poverty, and in an hour of glory to recollect the days of one's disgrace, and at a season of peace to think upon the dangers that are past. . . . For people who have had prosperity and adversity before their eyes and have pushed the latter away and are enjoying the free use of the better, of necessity become thankful in disposition and are being urged on to piety by fear of a change of state to the contrary condition. As a result they honor God in songs and words for their present wealth and persistently entreat and conciliate him with supplications that they will no longer be tested with calamities. (210) Again, the beginning of this festival is appointed for the fifteenth day of the month, on account of the reason which has already been mentioned respecting the spring season, also that the world may be full, not by day only but also by night, of the most beautiful light, the sun and moon on their rising opposite to one another with uninterrupted light, without any darkness interposing itself between so as to divide them.   location 21868

Note:I could not find out the exact reference concerning the festival called castallus in the Bible. Sorry!
 (215) There is, besides all these, another Festival sacred to God, and a solemn assembly on the day of the festival which they call castallus, [castallus is translated "a basket with a pointed bottom." from the event that takes place in it, as we shall show presently. Now that this festival is not in the same rank, nor of the same importance with the other festivals, is plain from many considerations. For, first of all, it is not one to be observed by the whole population of the nation as each of the others is. Secondly, none of the things that are brought or offered are laid upon the altar as holy, or committed to the unextinguishable and holy fire. Thirdly, the very number of days which are to be observed in the festival are not expressly stated.  . . . (216) Nevertheless, anyone may easily see that it has about it some of the characteristics of a sacred festival, and that it comes very near to having the privileges of a solemn assembly. Foreveryone of those men who had lands and possessions, having filled vessels with every different species of fruit borne by fruit-bearing trees; which vessels, as I have said before, are called castalli, brings with great joy the first fruits of his abundant crop into the temple, and standing in front of the altar gives the basket to the priest, uttering at the same time the very beautiful and admirable hymn prescribed for the occasion;  . . . the hymn [sung at the festival of the castalli and other times] is as follows:--"The leaders of our nation renounced Syria, and migrated to Egypt. Being but few in number, they increased till they became a populous nation. Their descendants being oppressed in innumerable ways by the natives of the land, when no assistance did any longer appear to be expected from men, became the supplicants of God, having fled for refuge to entreat his assistance. Therefore he, who is merciful to all who are unjustly treated, having received their supplication, smote those who oppressed them with signs and wonders, and prodigies, and with all the marvelous works which he wrought at that time. And he delivered those who were being insulted and enduring every kind of perfidious oppression, not only leading them forth to freedom, but even giving them in addition a most fertile land; for it is from the fruits of this land, O bounteous God! that we now bring you the first fruits; if indeed it is a proper expression to say that he who receives them from you brings them to you. For, O Master! they are all your favors and your gifts, of which you have thought us worthy, and so enabled us to live comfortably and to rejoice in unexpected blessings which you have given to us, who did not expect them." . . . This hymn [described in the festival of the castalli] is sung from the beginning of summer to the end of autumn, by two choruses replying to one another uninterruptedly, on two separate occasions, each at the end of one complete half of ten years;  location 21899

{Ex 20:12; Law, Mosaic; Eph 6:2; Deut 5:16}
I shall now proceed in regular order to consider the commandment which comes next, which is entitled the one about the Honor due to Parents. . . . Having already spoken of four commandments which, both as to the order in which they are placed and as to their importance, are truly the first; namely, the commandment about the lenity of that sovereign authority by which the world is governed, and that which commands that man should not look upon any representation or figure of anything as God, and that which forbids the Oaths falsely, or indeed the Oaths carelessly and vainly at all, and that concerning the sacred seventh day--all which commandments tend to piety and holiness.  . . . For parents themselves are something between divine and human nature, partaking of both; of human nature, inasmuch as it is plain that they have been born and that they will die; and of divine nature, because they have engendered other beings, and have brought what did not exist into existence: for, in my opinion, what God is to the world, that parents are to their children; since, just as God gave existence to that which had no existence, they also, in imitation of his power, as far at least as they were able, make the race of mankind everlasting.  . . . And this is not the only reason why a man's father and mother are deserving of honor, but here are also several other reasons. For among all those nations who have any regard for virtue, the older men are esteemed above the younger, and teachers above their pupils, and benefactors above those who have received kindnesses from them, and rulers above their subjects, and masters above their slaves.  . . . parents are placed in the higher and superior class; for they are the elders, and the teachers, and the benefactors, and the rulers, and the masters. And sons and daughters are placed in the inferior class; for they are the younger, and the pupils, and the persons who have received kindnesses, and subjects, and slaves.  location 21925

I affirm, therefore, that that which produces is always older than that which is produced, and that that which causes anything is older than that of which it is the cause; but those who beget or bring forth a child are in some sense the causes and producers of the child which is begotten or brought forth, and they stand in the light of teachers, inasmuch as all that they know themselves they teach to their children from their earliest infancy,  . . . For who can be more completely the benefactors of their children than parents, who have not only caused them to exist, but have afterwards thought them worthy of food, and after that again of education both in body and soul, and have enabled them not only to live, but also to live well;  . . . And in addition to the benefits which they heap upon them, they have likewise authority over the children of whom they are the parents, not as is the case in cities, in consequence of some drawing of lots or election, so that anyone can find fault with his governor as having become so either by some blunder of fortune and not by reason, or it may be by the impetuosity of the multitude, the most inconsiderate and foolish of all things, but being established in this post by the most excellent and perfect wisdom of the sublime nature, which regulates all divine and human affairs in accordance with justice.  location 21940

For these reasons it is allowable for parents even to accuse their children, and to reprove them with considerable severity, and even, if they do not submit to the threats which are uttered to them by word of mouth, to beat them, and inflict personal punishment on them, and to imprison them; and if they behave with obstinacy and resist this treatment, becoming stiff-necked through the greatness of their incurable wickedness, the law permits them to chastise them even to the extent of putting them to Death.(Deuteronomy 21:18.)  . . .. But still this permission is not given to either the father by himself, or to the mother by herself, by reason of the greatness of the punishment, which it is not fitting should be determined by one, but by both together, for it is not probable that both the parents will agree about putting their child to death unless his iniquities are very grievous, and weigh down by a certain undoubted preponderance.    . . . But parents have received not only the power of a ruler and governor over their children, but also that of a master, according to both the very highest characteristics of the possession of servants, namely, possessing them as born in the house, and also as purchased with money, for they expend a price many times greater than their real value on their children and for the sake of their children, in wages to nurses, and instructors, and teachers, besides all the expenses which they incur for their dress and their food, and their other care of them when well and when sick, from their earliest infancy till the time that they are full grown.  . . . And not only are those looked upon as servants born in the house who have actually been brought forth within the walls, but those also are so regarded who by the laws of nature receive from the masters of the house a sufficient support to maintain them in life after they are born.  location 21956

{Ex 20:12; Prov 20:20; Eph 6:1-4}
(234) Since this, then, is the case, those who do honor their parents are not doing anything worthy of praise, since even any single one of the commandments already mentioned is sufficient to invite them to regard their parents with reverence. But are not those men worthy of blame, and accusation, and the very extremity of punishment, who neither respect them as older than themselves, nor listen to them as their teachers, nor think them worthy of any requital as their benefactors, nor obey them as their rulers, nor fear them as their masters? (235) Therefore the law says, "Honor your father and your mother next after God;" assigning to them the second place in honor, on the same principle as nature herself has ranked them in her decision of their proper place and duties. And you will not honor them more by any line of conduct than by endeavoring and appearing to be virtuous persons. As the being such is a seeking of virtue without pride and without guile, and appearing such aims at virtue in connection with a good reputation and praise from one's associates; (236) for parents, thinking but little of their own advantage, think the virtue and excellence of their children the perfection of their own happiness, for which reason it is that they are anxious that they should obey the injunctions which are laid upon them, and that they should be obedient to all just and beneficial commands; for a father will never teach his child anything which is inconsistent with virtue or with truth.

{Lev 19:32; Prov 20:29; 1 Tim 5:1}
And anyone may conjecture that pious respect is due to parents, not only from what has been said above, but also from the manner in which persons behave to those who are of the same age with their parents; for the man who shows respect to an old man, or to an old woman, who is no relation to him, must appear in some degree to be remembering his own father and mother, and, out of this consideration, to be looking upon them as the images of his parents, who are the real models.  . . . it is not only commanded that young men should rise up and give the best seats to their elders, but also that they should rise up before them when they pass by; (Leviticus 19:32) showing honor to the grey hairs of old age,  . . . And this commandment also seems to me to have been enacted with exceeding beauty and propriety; for the law says, "Let each man fear his father and his mother,"(Leviticus 19:3) enjoining fear rather than affection, not as being more advantageous and profitable with reference to the present occasion,  . . . But the second feeling, namely, affection towards their parents, it is not fitting should be inculcated on children by the injunctions of a lawgiver, for nature requires that that should be spontaneous. For it has implanted it so deeply from very infancy in the souls of those who are so completely united by blood, and by the services done by the parents to the children, that it is always self-taught and spontaneous, and has no need of commandments to enforce it.  location 21978

still some persons do not receive their affection as if it aimed solely at their good, being full of luxury and arrogance; and coveting a luxurious life, and becoming effeminate both in body and soul,  . . . But we must also urge on the parents of such persons that they employ more weighty and severe admonitions in order to cure this impetuous obstinacy of their children, and we must warn the children to reverence their parents, fearing them as their rulers and natural masters;  location 21987

{Ex 21:15-17}
XLIV. (242) I have now then gone through all the five heads of laws in the first table, and have noticed also all the particular points which had any reference to any individual. I must also now point out the punishments affixed to the transgression of these laws. (243) Now there is one common penalty affixed to them all, namely, death, through which all such offences have a kind of relationship to one another. But the causes of this sentence being pronounced in such cases are different, and we must begin with the last, the one that relates to parents, since it is in reference to this one that the words are still ringing in our ears, "If anyone shall beat his father or his mother, let him be Stoned." (45) [#ex 21:15.] And very justly, for it is not fit that that man should live who insults those who are the causes of his living; (244) but some of the men of high rank, and some of the lawgivers, looking rather at the vain opinions of men than at the truth, have softened this commandment, and instituted as a penalty, for those who beat their fathers, that their hands should be cut off; and for the sake of bearing a good reputation in the eyes of hasty and inconsiderate persons, they profess to them that it is becoming, that the parts with which such men have struck their parents should be cut off; (245) but it is a piece of folly to be angry with the servants rather than with those who are the causes of such folly;   . . . And even if he has not laid hands upon his parents, but has only spoken ill of those whom he was bound to praise and bless, or if he has in any other manner done anything which can tend to bring his parents into disrepute, still let him die (Exodus 21:16).  location 22012

As therefore, in my opinion, it was not permitted to kindle a fire on the seventh day for the reason which I have already mentioned, so likewise it was not lawful to collect any fuel for a fire.  location 22027

(252) Against those who call God as a witness in favor of assertions which are not true, the punishment of death is ordained in the Law (de 19:19.) and very properly, for even a man of moderate respectability will never endure to be cited as a witness, and to have his name registered in support of a lie. But it seems to me that he would look upon anyone who proposed such a thing to him as a thoroughly faithless enemy; (253) on which account we must say this, that him, who swears rashly and falsely, calling God to witness an unjust oath, God, although he is merciful by nature, will yet never release, inasmuch as he is thoroughly defiled and infamous from guilt, even though he may escape punishment at the hands of men. And such a man will never entirely escape, for there are innumerable beings looking on, zealots for and keepers of the national laws, of rigid justice, prompt to stone such a criminal,   . . . since surely it is a greater iniquity than even to speak disparagingly or to insult one's parents, to show a contempt for the sacred name of God by means of perjury. And if even he who swears in an unbecoming manner is guilty and blamable, of what punishment is that man worthy who denies the one only true and living God   location 22039

But Jubal, who was born of the same mother with him, exercised himself in music; and invented the psaltery and the harp.

And that their inventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, upon Adam's prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the force of fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of water, they made two pillars, 10 the one of brick, the other of stone: they inscribed their discoveries on them both, that in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might remain, and exhibit those discoveries to mankind; and also inform them that there was another pillar of brick erected by them.

For those ancients were beloved of God and made by God himself [i.e., Adam and Eve]. And because their food was then fitter for the prolongation of life. . . . And besides [in the case of the descendants of Seth], God afforded them a longer time of life on account of their virtue and the good use they made of it in astronomical and geometrical discoveries, which would not have afforded the time of foretelling unless they had lived six hundred years. For the Great Year is completed in that interval. Now I have witnesses for what I have said. . . .

1.  Now the sons of Noah were three,--Shem, Japhet, and Ham, born one hundred years before the Deluge. These first of all descended from the mountains into the plains, and fixed their habitation there; and persuaded others who were greatly afraid of the lower grounds on account of the flood, and so were very loath to come down from the higher places, to venture to follow their examples. Now the plain in which they first dwelt was called Shinar. God also commanded them to send colonies abroad, for the thorough peopling of the earth, that they might not raise seditions among themselves, but might cultivate a great part of the earth, and enjoy its fruits after a plentiful manner. But they were so ill instructed that they did not obey God; for which reason they fell into calamities. . . . But they, imagining the prosperity they enjoyed was not derived from the favor of God, but supposing that their own power was the proper cause of the plentiful condition they were in, did not obey him.    location 706

He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as if it was through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into tyranny. . . . He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a mind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high for the waters to be able to reach, and that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers!    location 712

3. Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God. And they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than anyone could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them various languages.     location 717
Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, bk. 1, ch. 4, par.3.

{Gen 11:7-9}
The place where they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before. For the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, "confusion." The Sibyl also makes mention of this tower, and of the confusion of the language, when she says thus: "When all men were of one language, some of them built a high tower, as if they would thereby ascend up to heaven, but the gods sent storms of wind and overthrew the tower, and gave everyone his peculiar language; and for this reason it was that the city was called Babylon."    location 722

For when in after-ages they grew powerful, they claimed to themselves the glory of antiquity; giving names to the nations that sounded well [in Greek] that they might be better understood among themselves; and setting agreeable forms of government over them, as if they were a people derived from themselves.    location 730

Some indeed of its names are utterly vanished away; others of them being changed, and another sound given them, are hardly to be discovered. Yet a few there are which have kept their denominations entire. For of the four sons of Ham, time has not at all hurt the name of Chus [Cush]; for the Ethiopians, over whom he reigned, are even at this day, both by themselves and by all men in Asia, called Chusites.

When his youngest son saw this, he came laughing, and showed him to his brethren; but they covered their father's nakedness. And when Noah was made sensible of what had been done, he prayed for prosperity to his other sons. As for Ham, he did not curse him because of his nearness in blood, but cursed his descendants. And when the rest of them escaped that curse, God inflicted it on the children of Canaan.   location 779

He [Abram] was a person of great sagacity, both for understanding all things and persuading his hearers, and not mistaken in his opinions; for which reason he began to have higher notions of virtue than others had, and he determined to renew and to change the opinion all men happened then to have concerning God; for he was the first that ventured to publish this notion that there was but one God, the Creator of the universe; and that, as to other [gods], if they contributed anything to the happiness of men, that each of them afforded it only according to his appointment, and not by their own power. . . . For which doctrines, when the Chaldeans, and other people of Mesopotamia, raised a tumult against him, he thought fit to leave that country; and at the command and by the assistance of God, he came and lived in the land of Canaan.    location 814

2. Berosus mentions our father Abram without naming him, when he says thus: "In the tenth generation after the Flood, there was among the Chaldeans a man righteous and great, and skillful in the celestial science." But Hecatseus does more than barely mention him; for he composed, and left behind him, a book concerning him. And Nicolaus of Damascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: "Abram reigned at Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans. But, after a long time, he got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of Judea, and this when his posterity were become a multitude; as to which posterity of his, we relate their history in another work.    location 816

1. Now, seeing he was to take Sarai with him, and was afraid of the madness of the Egyptians with regard to women, lest the king should kill him on occasion of his wife's great beauty, he contrived this device:--he pretended to be her brother, and directed her in a dissembling way to pretend the same, for he said it would be for their benefit. Now, as soon as he came into Egypt, it happened to Abram as he supposed it would; for the fame of his wife's beauty was greatly talked of; for which reason Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, would not be satisfied. . . . but God put a stop to his unjust inclinations, by sending upon him a distemper, and a sedition against his government. And when he inquired of the priests how he might be freed from these calamities, they told him that this his miserable condition was derived from the wrath of God, upon account of his inclinations to abuse the stranger's wife. He then, out of fear, asked Sarai who she was, and who it was that she brought along with her. And when he had found out the truth, he excused himself to Abram, that supposing the woman to be his sister, and not his wife, he set his affections on her. . . . He also made him a large present in money, and gave him leave to enter into conversation with the most learned among the Egyptians; from which conversation his virtue and his reputation became more conspicuous than they had been before.    location 837

2. For whereas the Egyptians were formerly addicted to different customs, and despised one another's sacred and accustomed rites, and were very angry one with another on that account, Abram conferred with each of them, and, confuting the reasonings they made use of, everyone for their own practices, demonstrated that such reasonings were vain and void of truth. Whereupon Abraham was admired by them in those conferences as a very wise man, and one of great sagacity, when he discoursed on any subject he undertook; and this not only in understanding it, but in persuading other men also to assent to him. He communicated to them arithmetic, and delivered to them the science of astronomy; for before Abram came into Egypt they were unacquainted with those parts of learning; for that science came from the Chaldeans into Egypt, and from thence to the Greeks also.    location 841

There were five kings that managed the affairs of this county: Ballas, Barsas, Senabar, and Sumobor, with the king of Bela; and each king led on his own troops: and the Assyrians made war upon them; and, dividing their army into four parts, fought against them [and imposed tribute].    location 850

But on the thirteenth year the [kings of Sodom] rebelled, and then the army of the Assyrians came upon them, under their commanders.

Now the king of Sodom met him at a certain place, which they called The King's Dale, where Melchisedec, king of the city Salem, received him. That name signifies, the righteous king: and such he was, without dispute, insomuch that, on this account, he was made the priest of God. However, they afterward called Salem, Jerusalem. Now this Melchisedec supplied Abram's army in an hospitable manner, and gave them provisions in abundance; and as they were feasting, he began to praise him, and to bless God for subduing his enemies under him. And when Abram gave him the tenth part of his prey, he accepted of the gift:    location 870

3. The manner of Abram's sacrifice was this:--He took an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram in like manner of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon and as he was enjoined, he divided the three former, but the birds he did not divide. After which, before he built his altar, where the birds of prey flew about, as desirous of blood, a Divine voice came to him, declaring that their neighbors would be grievous to his posterity, when they should be in Egypt, for four hundred years; during which time they should be afflicted, but afterwards should overcome their enemies, should conquer the Canaanites in war, and possess themselves of their land, and of their cities. 
[Editor's footnote: It is worth noting here, that God required no other sacrifices under the law of Moses than what were taken from these five kinds of animals, which he here required of Abram. Nor did the Jews feed upon any other domestic animals than the three here named.]

4. Now Abram dwelt near the oak called Ogyges,--the place belongs to Canaan, not far from the city of Hebron. But being uneasy at his wife's barrenness, he entreated God to grant that he might have male issue; and God required of him to be of good courage, and said that he would add to all the rest of the benefits that he had bestowed upon him, ever since he led him out of Mesopotamia, the gift of children. Accordingly Sarai, at God's command, brought to his bed one of her handmaidens, a woman of Egyptian descent, in order to obtain children by her. And when this handmaid was with child, she triumphed, and ventured to affront Sarai, as if the dominion were to come to a son to be born of her.    location 887

Now a Divine Angel met Hagar, as she was going forward in the wilderness, and bid her return to her master and mistress, for if she would submit to that wise advice, she would live better hereafter; for that the reason of her being in such a miserable case was this, that she had been ungrateful and arrogant towards her mistress. He also told her, that if she disobeyed God, and went on still in her way, she should perish; but if she would return back, she should become the mother of a son who should reign over that country. These admonitions she obeyed, and returned to her master and mistress, and obtained forgiveness.    … A little while afterwards, she bare Ismael; which may be interpreted Heard of God, because God had heard his mother's prayer.    location 897

Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer anythingimmodest to the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither thus were they made ashamed.    location 920

As for Sarah, she at first loved Ismael, who was born of her own handmaid Hagar, with an affection not inferior to that of her own son, for he was brought up in order to succeed in the government; but when she herself had borne Isaac, she was not willing that Ismael should be brought up with him, as being too old for him, and able to do him injuries when their father should be dead; she therefore persuaded Abraham to send him and his mother to some distant country. Now, at the first, he did not agree to what Sarah was so zealous for, and thought it an instance of the greatest barbarity, to send away a young child 26 and a woman unprovided of necessaries; but at length he agreed to it, because God was pleased with what Sarah had determined: so he delivered Ismael to his mother, as not yet able to go by himself; and commanded her to take a bottle of water, and a loaf of bread, and so to depart, and to take Necessity for her guide.    location 964

Flavius Josephus alludes to a place he calls Troglodytis while discussing the account in Genesis, that after the death of Sarah, Abraham married Keturah and fathered six sons who in turn fathered many more. "Now, for all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of Arabia Felix..."[6]
The Troglodytis Josephus refers to here is generally taken to mean both coasts of the Red Sea.[7] However, Josephus goes on to state that the descendants of one of these grandsons, Epher, invaded Libya, and that the name of Africa was thus derived from that of Epher.[8]
Now, for all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of Arabia the Happy, as far as it reaches to the Red Sea.    location 1030

However, the servant came to Haran; and when he was in the suburbs, he met a considerable number of maidens going to the water; he therefore prayed to God that Rebeka might be found among them,    
… and that she might be made known to him by the sign, That while others denied him water to drink, she might give it him.    location 1048

Now Isaac's wife proved with child, after the death of Abraham; 30 and when her belly was greatly burdened, Isaac was very anxious, and inquired of God; who answered, that Rebeka should bear twins; and that two nations should take the names of those sons; and that he who appeared the second should excel the elder.    location 1081

Now when Esau, one of the sons of Isaac, whom the father principally loved, was now come to the age of forty years, he married Adah, the daughter of Helon, and Aholibamah, the daughter of Esebeon; which Helon and Esebeon were great lords among the Canaanites: thereby taking upon himself the authority, and pretending to have dominion over his own marriages, without so much as asking the advice of his father; for had Isaac been the arbitrator, he had not given him leave to marry thus, for he was not pleased with contracting any alliance with the people of that country;    location 1101

[Ed note: The supper of savory meat, as we call it, Genesis 27:4, to be caught by hunting, was intended plainly for a festival or a sacrifice; and upon the prayers that were frequent at sacrifices, Isaac expected, as was then usual in such eminent cases, that a divine impulse would come upon him, in order to the blessing of his son there present, and his foretelling his future behavior and fortune.    location 1449

He called the country by that name from himself, for he was named Adom … on account of the redness of this pottage, he was, in way of jest, by his contemporaries, called Adom, for the Hebrews call what is red Adom; and this was the name given to the country; but the Greeks gave it a more agreeable pronunciation, and named it Idumea.    location 1504

He also exhorted them to look on it as everyone's own possession, and to fall to their husbandry with cheerfulness, and to pay as a tribute to the king, the fifth part of the fruits for the land which the king, when it was his own, restored to them.    … Now this law, that they should pay the fifth part of their fruits as tribute, continued until their later kings.    location 1974

Which thing was so feared by the king, that, according to this man's opinion, he commanded that they should cast every male child, which was born to the Israelites, into the river, and destroy it; that besides this, the Egyptian midwives should watch the labors of the Hebrew women, and observe what is born,    location 2006

And when one time had carried Moses to her father, she showed him to him, and said she thought to make him her successor, if it should please God she should have no legitimate child of her own;    … And she had said this, she put the infant into her father's hands: so he took him, and hugged him to his breast; and on his daughter's account, in a pleasant way, put his diadem upon his head; but Moses threw it down to the ground, and, in a puerile mood, he wreathed it round, and trod upon his feet, which seemed to bring along with evil presage concerning the kingdom of Egypt. But when the sacred scribe saw this, [he was the person who foretold that his nativity would the dominion of that kingdom low,] he made a violent attempt to kill him; and crying out in a frightful manner, he said, "This, O king! this child is he of whom God foretold, that if we kill him we shall be in no danger; he himself affords an attestation to the prediction of the same thing, by his trampling upon your government"   … But Thermuthis prevented him, and snatched the child away. And the king was not hasty to slay him, God himself, whose providence protected Moses, inclining the king to spare him. He was, therefore, educated with great care. So the Hebrews depended on him, and were of good hopes great things would be done by him; but the Egyptians were suspicious of what would follow such his education.    location 2087

{Moses}
  The Ethiopians, who are next neighbors to the Egyptians, made an inroad into their country, which they seized upon, and carried off the effects of the Egyptians, who, in their rage, fought against them, and revenged the affronts they had received from them; but being overcome in battle, some of them were slain, and the rest ran away in a shameful manner, and by that means saved themselves; whereupon the Ethiopians followed after them in the pursuit,    location 2095
  The Egyptians, under this sad oppression, betook themselves to their oracles and prophecies; and when God had given them this counsel, to make use of Moses the Hebrew, and take his assistance, the king commanded his daughter to produce him, that he might be the general 22 of their army.    location 2100
  2. So Moses, at the persuasion both of Thermuthis and the king himself, cheerfully undertook the business: and the sacred scribes of both nations were glad; those of the Egyptians, that they should at once overcome their enemies by his valor, and that by the same piece of management Moses would be slain; but those of the Hebrews, that they should escape from the Egyptians, because Moses was to be their general.    location 2105
  When he had therefore proceeded thus on his journey, he came upon the Ethiopians before they expected him; and, joining battle with them, he beat them, and deprived them of the hopes they had of success against the Egyptians, and went on in overthrowing their cities, and indeed made a great slaughter of these Ethiopians.    location 2119

  she fell deeply in love with him; and upon the prevalancy of that passion, sent to him the most faithful of all her servants to discourse with him about their marriage. He thereupon accepted the offer, on condition she would procure the delivering up of the city; and gave her the assurance of an oath to take her to his wife; and that when he had once taken possession of the city, he would not break his oath to her.    location 2132
  No sooner was the agreement made, but it took effect immediately; and when Moses had cut off the Ethiopians, he gave thanks to God, and consummated his marriage, and led the Egyptians back to their own land.    location 2135

And he took with him Zipporah, the daughter of Raguel, whom he had married, and the children he had by her, Gersom and Eleazer, and made haste into Egypt.  … he came to the king, who had indeed but lately received the government, and told him how much he had done for the good of the Egyptians, when they were despised by the Ethiopians, and their country laid waste by them; and how he had been the commander of their forces, and had labored for them, as if they had been his own people and he informed him in what danger he had been during that expedition, without having any proper returns made him as he had deserved.

And indeed while Moses stretched out his hand towards heaven 7 the Hebrews were too hard for the Amalekites: but Moses not being able to sustain his hands thus stretched out, [for as often as he let down his hands, so often were his own people worsted,] he bade his brother Aaron, and Hur their sister Miriam's husband, to stand on each side of him, and take hold of his hands, and not permit his weariness to prevent it, but to assist him in the extension of his hands. When this was done, the Hebrews conquered the Amalekites by main force; and indeed they had all perished, unless the approach of the night had obliged the Hebrews to desist from killing any more.    … got great and splendid advantages, which they obtained of their enemies by their hard pains in this battle: for when they had taken the enemy's camp, they got ready booty for the public, and for their own private families, whereas till then they had not any sort of plenty, of even necessary food. The forementioned battle, when they had once got it, was also the occasion of their prosperity, not only for the present, but for the future ages also; for they not only made slaves of the bodies of their enemies, but subdued their minds also, and after this battle, became terrible to all that dwelt round about them.    … Moreover, they acquired a vast quantity of riches; for a great deal of silver and gold was left in the enemy's camp; as also brazen vessels, which they made common use of in their families; many utensils also that were embroidered there were of both sorts, that is, of what were weaved, and what were the ornaments of their armor, and other things that served for use in the family, and for the furniture of their rooms; they got also the prey of their cattle, and of whatsoever uses to follow camps, when they remove from one place to another.    location 2694

Now when the fire rushed upon them, and began to burn them, nobody could quench it. Accordingly they died in this manner. And Moses bid their father and their brethren to take up their bodies, to carry them out of the camp, and to bury them magnificently.

Whence it came to pass that those Greeks, who had a veneration for our laws, because they could not possibly contradict this, called that breastplate the Oracle.

One of the priests set the woman at the gates that are turned towards the temple, and took the veil from her head, and wrote the name of God on parchment, and enjoined her to swear that she had not at all injured her husband; and to wish that, if she had violated her chastity, her right thigh might be put out of joint; that her belly might swell; and that she might die thus: but that if her husband, by the violence of his affection, and of the jealousy which arose from it, had been rashly moved to this suspicion, that she might bear a male child in the tenth month.  … and gave it her to drink; whereupon the woman, if she were unjustly accused, conceived with child, and brought it to perfection in her womb: but if she had broken her faith of wedlock to her husband, and had sworn falsely before God, she died in a reproachful manner; her thigh fell off from her, and her belly swelled with a dropsy.    location 3215

{Lev 18:6-14}
1. As for adultery, Moses forbade it entirely, as esteeming it a happy thing that men should be wise in the affairs of wedlock; and that it was profitable both to cities and families that children should be known to be genuine. He also abhorred men's lying with their mothers, as one of the greatest crimes; and the like for lying with the father's wife, and with aunts, and sisters, and sons' wives, as all instances of abominable wickedness. He also forbade a man to lie with his wife when she was defiled by her natural purgation: and not to come near brute beasts; nor to approve of the lying with a male, which was to hunt after unlawful pleasures on account of beauty. To those who were guilty of such insolent behavior, he ordained death for their punishment.    location 3220

{Lev 21:7-15; Priests, Jewish}
2. As for the priests, he prescribed to them a double degree of purity 25 for he restrained them in the instances above, and moreover forbade them to marry harlots. He also forbade them to marry a slave, or a captive, and such as got their living by cheating trades, and by keeping inns; as also a woman parted from her husband, on any account whatsoever. Nay, he did not think it proper for the high priest to marry even the widow of one that was dead, though he allowed that to the priests; but he permitted him only to marry a virgin, and to retain her. Whence it is that the high priest is not to come near to one that is dead, although the rest are not prohibited from coming near to their brethren, or parents, or children, when they are dead;    location 3225

But as to the derivation of the word manna, whether from man, which Josephus says then signified What is it or from mannah, to divide, i.e., a dividend or portion allotted to everyone, it is uncertain: I incline to the latter derivation.

FOOTNOTES:  The use of these golden bells at the bottom of the high priest's long garment, seems to me to have been this: That by shaking his garment at the time of his offering incense in the temple, on the great day of expiation, or at other proper periods of his sacred ministrations there, on the great festivals, the people might have notice of it, and might fall to their own prayers at the time of incense, or other proper periods; and so the whole congregation might at once offer those common prayers jointly with the high priest himself to the Almighty See Luke 1:10; Revelation 8:3, 4. Nor probably is the son of Sirach to be otherwise understood, when he says of Aaron, the first high priest, Ecelus. 45:9, "And God encompassed Aaron with pomegranates, and with many golden bells round about, that as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children of his people."]    location 3413

B. VI. ch. 6. sect. 4; but rather by an audible voice from the mercy- seat between the cherubims. See Prideaux's Connect. at the year 534.

7. So when the Midianites had sent their daughters, as Balaam had exhorted them, the Hebrew men were allured by their beauty, and came with them, and besought them not to grudge them the enjoyment of their beauty, nor to deny them their conversation. These daughters of Midianites received their words gladly, and consented to it, and staid with them; but when they brought them to be enamored of them, and their inclinations to them were grown to ripeness, they began to think of departing from them: then it was that these men became greatly disconsolate at the women's departure, and they were urgent with them not to leave them, but begged they would continue there, and become their wives; and they promised them they should be owned as mistresses all they had. This they said with an oath, and called God for the arbitrator of what they promised; and this with tears in their eyes, and all such marks of concern, as might shew how miserable they thought themselves without them, and so might move their compassion for them. So the women, as soon as they perceived they had made their slaves, and had caught them with their conservation began to speak thus to them:-- 8. "O you illustrious young men! we have of our own at home, and great plenty of good things there, together with the natural, affectionate parents and friends; nor is it out of our want of any such things that we came to discourse with you; nor did we admit of your invitation with design to prostitute the beauty of our bodies for gain; but taking you for brave and worthy men, we agreed to your request, that we might treat you with such honors as hospitality required: and now seeing you say that you have a great affection for us, and are troubled when you think we are departing, we are not averse to your entreaties; and if we may receive such assurance of your good-will as we think can be alone sufficient, we will be glad to lead our lives with you as your wives; but we are afraid that you will in time be weary of our company, and will then abuse us, and send us back to our parents, after an ignominious manner."    location 3862

But the young men professed they would give them any assurance they should desire; nor did they at all contradict what they requested, so great was the passion they had for them. "If then," said they, "this be your resolution, since you make use of such customs and conduct of life as are entirely different from all other men, 12 insomuch that your kinds of food are peculiar to yourselves, and your kinds of drink not common to others, it will be absolutely necessary, if you would have us for your wives, that you do therefore worship our gods. Nor can there be any other demonstration of the kindness which you say you already have, and promise to have hereafter to us, than this, that you worship the same gods that we do. For has anyone reason to complain, that now you are come into this country, you should worship the proper gods of the same country? especially while our gods are common to all men, and yours such as belong to nobody else but yourselves."    location 3877

so they gave themselves up to what they persuaded them, and transgressed their own laws, and supposing there were many gods, and resolving that they would sacrifice to them according to the laws of that country which ordained them, they both were delighted with their strange food, and went on to do every thing that the women would have them do, though in contradiction to their own laws; so far indeed that this transgression was already gone through the whole army of the young men, and they fell into a sedition that was much worse than the former, and into danger of the entire abolition of their own institutions; for when once the youth had tasted of these strange customs, they went with insatiable inclinations into them;    location 3886

And besides that, he said it was not a reasonable thing, when they had lived soberly in the wilderness, to act madly now when they were in prosperity; and that they ought not to lose, now they have abundance, what they had gained when they had little:-- and so did he endeavor, by saying this, to correct the young inert, and to bring them to repentance for what they had done. 11. But Zimri arose up after him, and said, "Yes, indeed, Moses, You are at liberty to make use of such laws as You are so fond of, … but you shall not have me one of your followers in your tyrannical commands, for you do nothing else hitherto, but, under pretense of laws, and of God, wickedly impose on us slavery, and gain dominion to yourself, while you deprivest us of the sweetness of life, which consists in acting according to our own wills, and is the right of free-men, and of those that have no lord over them. Nay, indeed, this man is harder upon the Hebrews then were the Egyptians themselves, as pretending to punish, according to his laws, everyone's acting what is most agreeable to himself; but you yourself better deserve to suffer punishment, who presume to abolish what everyone acknowledges to be what is good for him,  … I have married, as you say rightly, a strange woman, and you hear what I do from myself as from one that is free, for truly I did not intend to conceal myself. I also own that I sacrificed to those gods to whom you do not think it fit to sacrifice; and I think it right to come at truth by inquiring of many people, and not like one that lives under tyranny, to suffer the whole hope of my life to depend upon one man;    location 3910

{Num 25:13-15}
--Phineas, a man in other respects better than the rest of the young men, and also one that surpassed his contemporaries in the dignity of his father, [for he was the son of Eleazar the high priest, and the grandson of [Aaron] Moses's brother,] who was greatly troubled at what was done by Zimri, he resolved in earnest to inflict punishment on him, before his unworthy behavior should grow stronger by impunity, and in order to prevent this transgression from proceeding further, which would happen if the ringleaders were not punished.  … So he came into Zimri's tent, and slew him with his javelin, and with it he slew Cozbi also,  … Accordingly many of those that had transgressed perished by the magnanimous valor of these young men; and the rest all perished by a plague, which distemper God himself inflicted upon them;  …. yet did he do him great honor, by setting down his prophecies in writing. And while it was in his power to claim this glory to himself, and make men believe they were his own predictions, there being no one that could be a witness against him, and accuse him for so doing, he still gave his attestation to him, and did him the honor to make mention of him on this account.    location 3933

5. At this time the chief men of the tribe of Manasseh came to Moses, and informed him that there was an eminent man of their tribe dead, whose name was Zelophehad, who left no male children, but left daughters; and asked him whether these daughters might inherit his land or not. He made this answer, That if they shall marry into their own tribe, they shall carry their estate along with them; but if they dispose of themselves in marriage to men of another tribe, they shall leave their inheritance in their father's tribe. And then it was that Moses ordained, that everyone's inheritance should continue in his own tribe.    location 3977

Whence I would advise you, if you intend to preserve these laws, to leave none of your enemies alive when you have conquered them, but to look upon it as for your advantage to destroy them all, lest, if you permit them to live, you taste of their manners, and thereby corrupt your own proper institutions. I also do further exhort you, to overthrow their altars, and their groves, and whatsoever temples they have among them, and to burn all such, their nation, and their very memory with fire;    location 4022

Moses gave them some consolation; and by calling them off the thought how worthy he was of their weeping for him, he exhorted them to keep to that form of government he had given them; and then the congregation was dissolved at that time.    4.

Let those that live as remote as the bounds of the land which the Hebrews shall possess, come to that city where the temple shall be, and this three times in a year, that they may give thanks to God for his former benefits, and may entreat him for those they shall want hereafter; and let them, by this means, maintain a friendly correspondence with one another by such meetings and feastings together, for it is a good thing for those that are of the same stock, and under the same institution of laws, not to be unacquainted with each other; which acquaintance will be maintained by thus conversing together, and by seeing and talking with one another, and so renewing the memorials of this union; for if they do not thus converse together continually, they will appear like mere strangers to one another.    location 4052

8. Let there be taken out of your fruits a tenth, besides that which you have allotted to give to the priests and Levites. This you may indeed sell in the country, but it is to be used in those feasts and sacrifices that are to be celebrated in the holy city; for it is fit that you should enjoy those fruits of the earth which God gives you to possess, so as may be to the honor of the donor. 9. You are not to offer sacrifices out of the hire of a woman who is a harlot 17 for the Deity is not pleased with anythingthat arises from such abuses of nature; of which sort none can be worse than this prostitution of the body. In like manner no one may take the price of the covering of a bitch, either of one that is used in hunting, or in keeping of sheep, and thence sacrifice to God.    location 4058

But let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of the levity and boldness of their sex 21 Nor let servants be admitted to give testimony, on account of the ignobility of their soul; since it is probable that they may not speak truth, either out of hope of gain, or fear of punishment.

17. Aristocracy, and the way of living under it, is the best constitution: and may you never have any inclination to any other form of government; and may you always love that form, and have the laws for your governors, and govern all your actions according to them; for you need no supreme governor but God. But if you shall desire a king, let him be one of your own nation;    … but let him do nothing without the high priest and the votes of the senators: let him not have a great number of wives, nor pursue after abundance of riches,    location 4108

18. Let it not be esteemed lawful to remove boundaries, neither our own, nor of those with whom we are at peace. Have a care you do not take those landmarks away which are, as it were, a divine and unshaken limitation of rights made by God himself, to last forever; since this going beyond limits, and gaining ground upon others, is the occasion of wars and seditions; for those that remove boundaries are not far off an attempt to subvert the laws.    location 4111

{Deut 22:10}
You are to plough your land with oxen, and not to oblige other animals to come under the same yoke with them; but to till your land with those beasts that are of the same kind with each other. The seeds are also to be pure, and without mixture, and not to be compounded of two or three sorts, since nature does not rejoice in the union of things that are not in their own nature alike; nor are you to permit beasts of different kinds to gender together, for there is reason to fear that this unnatural abuse may extend from beasts of different kinds to men, though it takes its first rise from evil practices about such smaller things.    location 4120

Nor are you to muzzle the mouths of the oxen when they tread the ears of corn in the thrashing-floor; for it is not just to restrain our fellow-laboring animals, and those that work in order to its production, of this fruit of their labors.    location 4132

Nor are you to prohibit those that pass by at the time when your fruits are ripe to touch them, but to give them leave to fill themselves full of what you have; and this whether they be of your own country or strangers,    … but let it not be esteemed lawful for them to carry any away. Nor let those that gather the grapes, and carry them to the wine-presses, restrain those whom they meet from eating of them; for it is unjust, out of envy, to hinder those that desire it, to partake of the good things that come into the world according to God's will, and this while the season is at the height, and is hastening away as it pleases God.    location 4135

  Nay, let them desire men that come from other countries, to partake of these tokens of friendship which God has given in their proper season; for that is not to be deemed as idly spent, which anyone out of kindness communicates to another, since God bestows plenty of good things on men,    location 4140

23. Let the Hebrews marry, at the age fit for it, virgins that are free, and born of good parents. And he that does not marry a virgin, let him not corrupt another man's wife, and marry her, nor grieve her former husband. Nor let free men marry slaves, although their affections should strongly bias any of them so to do; for it is decent, and for the dignity of the persons themselves, to govern those their affections. And further, no one ought to marry a harlot, whose matrimonial oblations, arising from the prostitution of her body, God will not receive; for by these means the dispositions of the children will be liberal and virtuous; I mean, when they are not born of base parents, and of the lustful conjunction of such as marry women that are not free. If anyone has been espoused to a woman as to a virgin, and does not afterward find her so to be, let him bring his action, and accuse her, and let him make use of such indications 24 to prove his accusation as he is furnished therefore;    location 4159

But for him that brings an accusation and calumny against his wife in an impudent and rash manner, let him be punished by receiving forty stripes save one, and let him pay fifty shekels to her father: but if the damsel be convicted, as having been corrupted, and is one of the common people, let her be stoned, because she did not preserve her virginity till she were lawfully married; but if she were the daughter of a priest, let her be burnt alive.    location 4170

Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, bk. 4, ch.8.

{Deut 22:28-29}
Let him that has corrupted a virgin not yet espoused marry her; but if the father of the damsel be not willing that she should be his wife, let him pay fifty shekels as the price of her prostitution. He that desires to be divorced from his wife for any cause 25 whatsoever, [and many such causes happen among men,] let him in writing give assurance that he will never use her as his wife anymore; for by this means she may be at liberty to marry another husband, although before this bill of divorce be given, she is not to be permitted so to do: but if she be misused by him also, or if, when he is dead, her first husband would marry her again, it shall not be lawful for her to return to him.    location 4181

{Deut 25:6-10; Deut 21:10-14}
But if the brother will not marry her, let the woman come before the senate, and protest openly that this brother will not admit her for his wife, but will injure the memory of his deceased brother, while she is willing to continue in the family, and to bear him children.    location 4190
But now, if any man take captive, either a virgin, or one that has been married, 26 and has a mind to marry her, let him not be allowed to bring her to bed to him, or to live with her as his wife, before she has her head shaven, and has put on her mourning habit, and lamented her relations and friends that were slain in the battle, that by this means she may give vent to her sorrow for them, and after that may betake herself to feasting and matrimony; for it is good for him that takes a woman, in order to have children by her, to be complaisant to her inclinations, and not merely to pursue his own pleasure, while he has no regard to what is agreeable to her. But when thirty days are past, as the time of mourning, for so many are sufficient to prudent persons for lamenting the dearest friends, then let them proceed to the marriage; but in case when he has satisfied his lust, he be too proud to retain her for his wife, let him not have it in his power to make her a slave, but let her go away whither she pleases, and have that privilege of a free woman.    location 4195

And say further to him, "That when you were born, we took you up with gladness, and gave God the greatest thanks for you, and brought time up with great care, and spared for nothing that appeared useful for your preservation, and for your instruction in what was most excellent.  … considering that God is displeased with those that are insolent towards their parents, because he is himself the Father of the whole race of mankind, and seems to bear part of that dishonor which falls upon those that have the same name, when they do not meet with dire returns from their children.    location 4211
 let him be stoned; and when he has continued there for one whole day, that all the people may see him, let him be buried in the night.

If anyone find gold or silver on the road, let him inquire after him that lost it, and make proclamation of the place where he found it, and then restore it to him again, as not thinking it right to make his own profit by the loss of another.

but when you are about to go to war, send embassages and heralds to those who are your voluntary enemies, for it is a right thing to make use of words to them before you come to your weapons of war; and assure them thereby, that although you have a numerous army, with horses and weapons, and, above these, a God merciful to you, and ready to assist you, you do however desire them not to compel you to fight against them, nor to take from them what they have, which will indeed be our gain, but what they will have no reason to wish we should take to ourselves.    location 4296

if they transgressed that institution for the worship of God, they should experience the following miseries:--Their land should be full of weapons of war from their enemies, and their cities should be overthrown, and their temple should be burnt that they should be sold for slaves, to such men as would have no pity on them in their afflictions; that they would then repent, when that repentance would no way profit them under their sufferings.

Now as soon as they were come to the mountain called Abarim, [which is a very high mountain, situated over against Jericho, and one that affords, to such as are upon it, a prospect of the greatest part of the excellent land of Canaan,] he dismissed the senate; and as he was going to embrace Eleazar and Joshua, and was still discoursing with them, a cloud stood over him on the sudden, and he disappeared in a certain valley, although he wrote in the holy books that he died, which was done out of fear, lest they should venture to say that, because of his extraordinary virtue, he went to God.    location 4375

He had a very graceful way of speaking and addressing himself to the multitude; and as to his other qualifications, he had such a full command of his passions, as if he hardly had any such in his soul, and only knew them by their names, as rather perceiving them in other men than in himself. He was also such a general of an army as is seldom seen, as well as such a prophet as was never known, and this to such a degree, that whatsoever he pronounced, you would think you heard the voice of God himself. So the people mourned for him    location 4381

That they have been long observed by the Pharisees and Rabbinical Jews is certain; however, the Karaites, who receive not the unwritten traditions of the elders, but keep close to the written law, with Jerome and Grotius, think they were not literally to be understood; as Bernard and Reland here take notice. Nor indeed do I remember that, either in the ancienter books of the Old Testament, or in the books we call Apocrypha, there are any signs of such literal observations appearing among the Jews, though their real or mystical signification, i.e. the constant remembrance and observation of the laws of God by Moses, be frequently inculcated in all the sacred writings.]    location 4470

{2 Pet 1:13-15; 2 Tim 4:6-8; Preface to Romans}
Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labors and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained the reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into captivity, compelled to flee, and stoned. After preaching both in the east and west, he gained the illustrious reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness to the whole world, and come to the extreme limit of the west, and suffered martyrdom under the prefects.    location 1930

{Heb 11:34; Gen 2:23}
Through envy, those women, the Danaids and Dircae, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments, finished the course of their faith with steadfastness, and though weak in body, received a noble reward. Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying of our father Adam, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh."    location 1937

Let us steadfastly contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to His excellent glory.

For Lot's wife, who went forth with him, being of a different mind from himself and not continuing in agreement with him [as to the command which had been given them], was made an example of, so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. . . .

Abraham was specially honored, and was called the friend of God; yet he, earnestly regarding the glory of God, humbly declared, "I am but dust and ashes." Moreover, it is thus written of Job, "Job was a righteous man, and blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from all evil."

Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation of us all. . . .

Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually proves to us that there shall be a future resurrection. ... Day and night declare to us a resurrection.

God had promised, "Thy seed shall be as the stars of heaven." All these, therefore, were highly honored, and made great, not for their own sake, or for their own works, or for the righteousness which they wrought, but through the operation of His will. . . . And we, too, being called by His will in Christ Jesus, are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty God has justified all men; to whom be glory forever and ever.    location 2175

What shall we do, then, brethren? Shall we become slothful in well-doing, and cease from the practice of love? God forbid that any such course should be followed by us! But rather let us hasten with all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work. . . . We see, then, how all righteous men have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord Himself, adorning Himself with His works, rejoiced. Having therefore such an example, let us without delay accede to His will, and let us work the work of righteousness with our whole strength.    location 2188

Let us therefore earnestly strive to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we may share in His promised gifts. But how, beloved, shall this be done? If our understanding be fixed by faith towards God; if we earnestly seek the things which are pleasing and acceptable to Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His blameless will; and if we follow the way of truth, casting away from us all unrighteousness and iniquity, along with all covetousness, strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking, all hatred of God, pride and haughtiness, vainglory and ambition. For they that do such things are hateful to God; and not only they that do them, but also those that take pleasure in them that do them. For the Scripture says, "But to the sinner God said, Wherefore do you declare my statutes, and take my covenant into your mouth, seeing you hate instruction, and cast my words behind you? When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and did make your portion with adulterers. Your mouth has abounded with wickedness, and your tongue contrived deceit. You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son." [Ps 50:17-20]    location 2204

All are not prefects, nor commanders of a thousand, nor of a hundred, nor of fifty, nor the like, but each one in his own rank performs the things commanded by the king and the generals. . . .

For his own peculiar services are assigned to the high priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and their own special ministrations devolve on the Levites. The layman is bound by the laws that pertain to laymen. . . . Let everyoneof you, brethren, give thanks to God in his own order, living in all good conscience, with becoming gravity, and not going beyond the rule of the ministry prescribed to him. Not in every place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they are not offered in any place.    location 2262

Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and there would be strife on account of the office of the episcopate. For this reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those [ministers] already mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, that when these should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their ministry. We are of opinion, therefore, that those appointed by them, or afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of the whole Church, and who have blamelessly served the flock of Christ in a humble, peaceable, and disinterested spirit, and have for a long time possessed the good opinion of all, cannot be justly dismissed from the ministry.    location 2290

For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the episcopate those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its duties.

Why do we divide and tear to pieces the members of Christ, and raise up strife against our own body? . . .

Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul. What did he write to you at the time when the Gospel first began to be preached? Truly, under the inspiration of the Spirit, he wrote to you concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos, because even then parties had been formed among you. But that inclination for one above another entailed less guilt upon you, inasmuch as your partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved.    location 2324

[Probably said with reference to Gnostic teachers:] Do not err, my brethren. Those that corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with anyone who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such a personbecoming defiled [in this way], shall go away into everlasting fire, and so shall everyonethat hearkens unto him.   Ignatius 3116
Ignatius, Letter to the Ephesians, Ch. 16

{Apostles Creed; Deity of Christ; Father and Son; Baptism}
 "Where is the wise man? where the disputer?" Where is the boasting of those who are styled prudent? For our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the appointment of God, conceived in the womb by Mary, of the seed of David, but by the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by His passion He might purify the water.    Ignatius 3137
Ignatius, Letter to the Ephesians, Ch. 18

{Atonement; Deity of Christ; Mt 12:29; Lk 10:17-20; Lk 11:20-22}
And there was agitation felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else [in the heavens]. Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every bond of wickedness disappeared; ignorance was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, God Himself being manifested in human form for the renewal of eternal life.    Ignatius 3149
Ignatius, Letter to the Ephesians, Ch. 19

{Church Government; Heb 13:17}
so that you obey the bishop and the presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine of immortality,    Ignatius 3166

{Communion; Jn 6:51; Jn 6:54}
antidote to prevent us from dying, but [which causes] that we should live forever in Jesus Christ.    Ignatius 3167

{Church Government}
Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most worthy bishop, and through your worthy presbyters Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the deacon Sotio,    Ignatius 3202
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 2

{1 Tim 4:12; 1 Cor 16:11; Heb 13:17}
Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of his youth, . . . but as being themselves prudent in God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all.    Ignatius 3210
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 3

{Mt 7:16-20; Heb 13:17}
It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop, but do all things without him.    Ignatius 3235
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 4

{Martyrdom; Mt 10:38-39}
If we are not in readiness to die into His passion, His life is not in us.    Ignatius 3246
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 5

{Church Government; Mt 24:45; Heb 13:17}
while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons,    Ignatius 3257
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 6

{Church Government; Heb 13:17}
Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters    Ignatius 3268
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 7

{Father and Son; Heb 13:17; Jn 4:34; Jn 5:30; Jn 6:38}
As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do you anything without the bishop and presbyters. . . . One Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.    Ignatius 3272
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 7

{Gal 3:1-12; Gal 5:4}
For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace.    Ignatius 3280
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 8

{Father and Son; 1 Cor 8:5-6; 1 Tim 1:17; Heb 1:3; Jn 1:18}
there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from silence, and who in all things pleased Him who sent Him.    Ignatius 3282
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 8

{Gal 4:9-11; Acts 15:28-29; Rev 1:10}

Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 9

{Rom 2:6; 1 Cor 3:8; Rev 22:12}
Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His disciples, let us learn to live according to the principles of Christianity.    Ignatius 3310
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 10

{Gal 1:6-9; Gal 2:21}
It is absurd to profess Christ Jesus, and to Judaize.    Ignatius 3313
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 10

{Phil 1:9-10}
Study, therefore, to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the apostles, that so all things, whatever you do, may prosper both in the flesh and spirit;    Ignatius 3351
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch.13

{Father and Son; Heb 13:17}
Be you subject to the bishop, and to one another, as Jesus Christ to the Father, according to the flesh, and the apostles to Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit; that so there may be a union both fleshly and spiritual.    Ignatius 3354
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch.13

{Antioch; Eph 6:19-20; Col 4:3; 1 Thess 5:25}
Be mindful of me in your prayers, that I may attain to God; and of the Church which is in Syria, whence I am not worthy to derive my name: for I stand in need of your united prayer in God, and your love,    Ignatius 3361
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch. 14

{Smyrna; Rev 2:1; Rev 2:8}
The Ephesians from Smyrna (from where I also write to you), who are here for the glory of God, as you also are, who have in all things refreshed me, salute you, along with Polycarp, the bishop of the Smyrnaeans.    Ignatius 3368
Ignatius, Letter to the Magnesians, Ch.15

{Asia; Eph 2:14}
to the holy Church which is at Tralles, in Asia, beloved of God, the Father of Jesus Christ, elect, and worthy of God, possessing peace through the flesh, and blood, and passion of Jesus Christ,     Ignatius 3375

{Martyrdom; Smyrna; Acts 5:41}
as Polybius your bishop has shown me, who has come to Smyrna by the will of God and Jesus Christ, and so sympathized in the joy which I, who am bound in Christ Jesus, possess,     Ignatius 3383
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.1

{Heb 13:17; 1 Tim 5:17; Church Government}
It is therefore necessary that, as you indeed do, so without the bishop you should do nothing, but should also be subject to the presbytery,     Ignatius 3393
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.2

{Church Government; Communion; Acts 6:1-4}                                                         
It is fitting also that the deacons, as being [the ministers] of the mysteries of Jesus Christ, should in every respect be pleasing to all. For they are not ministers of food and drink, but servants of the Church of God.     Ignatius 3395
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.2

{Church Government; Heb 13:17; 1 Tim 5:17}
In like manner, let all reverence the deacons as an appointment of Jesus Christ, and the bishop as Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the Father, and the presbyters as the sanhedrin of God and assembly of the apostles. Apart from these, there is no Church. Concerning all this, I am persuaded that you are of the same opinion.     Ignatius 3405
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.3

{Church Government; Acts 2:42; Twelve Apostles}
But shall I, when permitted to write on this point, reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a condemned man, I should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?     Ignatius 3409
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.3

{Heb 10:25; Heb 13:17; 2 Tim 2:2; 1 Cor 11:2; 2 Thess 2:15; Church Government}
continue in intimate union with Jesus Christ our God, and the bishop, and the enactments of the apostles. He that is within the altar is pure, but he that is without is not pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the bishop, and presbytery, and deacons, such a man is not pure in his conscience.     Ignatius 3455
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.7

{Apostles Creed; 2 Tim 2:2; 2 Thess 2:15}
Stop your ears, therefore, when anyone speaks to you at variance with Jesus Christ, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was truly born, and did eat and drink. He was truly persecuted under Pontius Pilate; He was truly crucified, and [truly] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also truly raised from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who believe in Him by Christ Jesus, apart from whom we do not possess the true life.     Ignatius 3485
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.9

{Gnostics; Martyrdom} 
But if, as some that are without God, that is, the unbelieving, say, that He only seemed to suffer (they themselves only seeming to exist), then why am I in bonds? Why do I long to be exposed to the wild beasts? Do I therefore die in vain?     Ignatius 3505
Ignatius, Letter to the Trallians, Ch.10

{Rev 2:8; Smyrna}
I salute you from Smyrna, together with the churches of God which are with me, who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit.     Ignatius 3541

{Ignatius; Jn 14:21; Rom 6:1-2; Preface to Romans}
Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church [in Rome] which has obtained mercy, through the majesty of the Most High Father, and Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son; . . . to those who are united, both according to the flesh and spirit, to everyoneof His commandments; who are filled inseparably with the grace of God, and are purified from every strange taint,    Ignatius 3569
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Preface

{Martyrdom; 2 Tim 4:6-8}
For I am afraid of your love, lest it should do me an injury. For it is easy for you to accomplish what you please; but it is difficult for me to attain to God, if you spare me.    
For if you are silent concerning me, I shall become God's; but if you show your love to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race. Pray, then, do not seek to confer any greater favor upon me than that I be sacrificed to God while the altar is still prepared;    Ignatius 3591
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.2

{Martyrdom; Intermediate State}
It is good to leave from the world unto God, that I may rise again to Him.    Ignatius 3594

{Martyrdom; Phil 2:13; Jas 2:14-16; Jas 1:22-23; 1 Jn 3:18}
Only request in my behalf both inward and outward strength, that I may not only speak, but [truly] will; and that I may not merely be called a Christian, but really be found to be one.    Ignatius 3603
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.3

{Deity of Christ}
For our God, Jesus Christ, now that He is with the Father, is all the more revealed [in His glory.    Ignatius 3606
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.3

{Martyrdom; Mt 10:32-33}
Suffer me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to God. I am the wheat of God, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of Christ.    Ignatius 3617
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.4

{Apostles; Peter; Paul}
I do not, as Peter and Paul, issue commandments unto you. They were apostles; I am but a condemned man:    Ignatius 3621
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.4

{Martyrdom; Mt 10:32-33}
May I enjoy the wild beasts that are prepared for me; and I pray they may be found eager to rush upon me, which also I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as with some, whom, out of fear, they have not touched. But if they be unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so. . . . Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings, breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful torments of the devil come upon me: only let me attain to Jesus Christ.    Ignatius 3638
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.5

{Martyrdom; 1 Jn 2:15-17}
All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth, shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die in behalf of Jesus Christ, than to reign over all the ends of the earth.    Ignatius 3649
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.6

{Martyrdom; Deity of Christ}
Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. If anyone has Him within himself, let him consider what I desire,    Ignatius 3654
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.6

{Martyrdom; Jn 4:13-14}
Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be you persuaded to listen to me, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My love has been crucified, and there is no fire in me desiring to be fed; but there is within me a water that lives and speaks, saying to me inwardly, Come to the Father.    Ignatius 3665
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.7

{Jn 6:54-58}
I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.    Ignatius 3668
Ignatius, Letter to the Romans, Ch.7

{Ignatius; Antioch; Church Government}
Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your love    Ignatius 3690

{Ignatius; Jn 13:34-35; Acts 28:14-15; New Testament Church}

Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Preface

{Church Government; Heb 13:17}
which I salute in the blood of Jesus Christ, who is our eternal and enduring joy, especially if [men] are in unity with the bishop, the presbyters, and the deacons, who have been appointed according to the mind of Jesus Christ, whom He has established in security, after His own will, and by His Holy Spirit.     Ignatius 3710
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Preface

{Mt 7:15; Acts 20:29-31; 2 Pet 2:1-3}
For there are many wolves that appear worthy of credit, who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive those that are running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place.     Ignatius 3732
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.2

{Philadelphia; Rev 3:7; Mt 15:13}
Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop.     Ignatius 3738
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.3

{Gal 5:20}
any man follows Him who makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God.     Ignatius 3741
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.3

{Church Government; Gal 5:20; Communion; Heb 13:17}
Take you heed, then, to have but one Communion. For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup to [show forth ] the unity of His blood; one altar; as there is one bishop, along with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants:     Ignatius 3761

{Prophets, Old Testament; Mt 13:17}
And let us also love the prophets, because they too have proclaimed the Gospel, and placed their hope in Him, and waited for Him; in whom also believing, they were saved, through union to Jesus Christ, being holy men, worthy of love and admiration, having had witness borne to them by Jesus Christ,     Ignatius 3794
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.5

{Acts 15:24; Gal 1:6-8; Gal 5:6; Gal 2:21}
But if anyone preach the Jewish law unto you, listen not to him. For it is better to hearken to Christian doctrine from a man who has been circumcised, than to Judaism from one uncircumcised.     Ignatius 3808

{1 Cor 2:10-11}
For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet the spirit, as being from God, is not deceived. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes, and detects the secrets     Ignatius 3834
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.7

{Gal 5:20; Heb13:17; Father and Son}
But the Spirit proclaimed these words: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your bodies as the temples of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be the followers of Jesus Christ, even as He is of His Father.     Ignatius 3838
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.7

{Gal 5:20; 1 Tim 2:8}
I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to unity. For where there is division and wrath, God does not dwell.     Ignatius 3847
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.8

{Preface to ECSB; New Testament Canon; Jn 5:39; Jn 7:52; Lk 24:27}
When I heard some saying, "If I do not find it in the ancient Scriptures, I will not believe the Gospel." On my saying to them, "It is written," they answered me, "That remains to be proved." But to me Jesus Christ is in the place of all that is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which is by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through your prayers, to be justified.    Ignatius 3849
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.1

{Jn 5:39; Lk 24:27}
For the beloved prophets announced Him, but the Gospel is the perfection of immortality.   Ignatius 3865
Ignatius, Letter to the Philadelphians, Ch.9

{Church Government; Antioch; Ignatius; Philadelphia; New Testament Church}
it is reported to me that the Church which is at Antioch in Syria possesses peace, it will become you, as a church of God, to elect a deacon to act as the ambassador of God [for you] to [the brethren there], that he may rejoice along with them when they are met together, and glorify the name [of God].

being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was truly of the seed of David according to the flesh, and the Son of God according to the will and power of God; that He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by Jn, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit we are by His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard for all ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful [followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church.

{Gnosticism; Communion; Jn 6:51; Mt 26:26; 2 Jn 10-11; Rom 16:17}
They abstain from the Communion and from prayer, because they confess not the Communion to be the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. . . . It is fitting, therefore, that you should keep aloof from such persons, and not to speak of them either in private or in public, but to give heed to the Prophets, and above all, to the Gospel, in which the passion [of Christ] has been revealed to us, and the resurrection has been fully proved. But avoid all divisions, as the beginning of evils.    Ignatius 3996

{Church Government; Communion; Baptism; Love Feast}
Let that be deemed a proper Communion, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God,     Ignatius 4009

{Barnabas}
I then, not as your teacher, but as one of yourselves, will set forth a few things by which in present circumstances you may be rendered the more joyful.    Barnabas 4913

{Isa 1:14; Ps 51:17; New Law}
"Incense is a vain abomination unto Me, and your new moons and sabbaths I cannot endure."  He has therefore abolished these things, that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of necessity, might have a human oblation.   . . . To us, then, He declares, "A sacrifice [pleasing] to God is a broken spirit; a smell of sweet aroma to the Lord is a heart that glorifies Him who made it."    Barnabas 4927
Barnabas, ch. 2

{1 Cor 10:12; Eternal Security}
We ought therefore, brethren, carefully to inquire concerning our salvation, lest the wicked one, having made his entrance by deceit, should hurl us forth from our [true] life.    Barnabas 4928
Barnabas, ch. 2

{Preface to Romans; Preface to Galatians; Acts 15:5}
take heed now to yourselves, and not to be like some, adding largely to your sins, and saying, "The covenant is both theirs and ours."    Barnabas 4952
Barnabas, ch. 4

{Heb 10:25}
Do not, by retiring apart, live a solitary life, as if you were already [fully] justified; but coming together in one place, make common inquiry concerning what tends to your general welfare.    Barnabas 4962
Barnabas, ch. 4

{Mt 20:16; Mt 22:14; Eternal Security}
Let us beware lest we be found [fulfilling that saying], as it is written, "Many are called, but few are chosen."     Barnabas 4969
Barnabas, ch. 4

{Rom 5:9; Eph 1:7; Heb 12:24}
For to this end the Lord endured to deliver up His flesh to corruption, that we might be sanctified through the remission of sins, which is effected by His blood of sprinkling.   Barnabas 4972
Barnabas, ch. 4

{Lk 5:8; Lk 5:27; Mt 9:13}
But when He chose His own apostles who were to preach His Gospel, [He did so from among those] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came "not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."    Barnabas 4984
Barnabas, ch. 5

{Isa 3:10}
For the prophet speaks against Israel, "Woe to their soul, because they have counselled an evil counsel against themselves, saying, Let us bind the just one, because he is displeasing to us." [LXX]   Barnabas 5003

{Ex 33:3; Millennium; Rev 20:4}
What, then, mean "milk and honey"? This, that as the infant is kept alive first by honey, and then by milk, so also we, being quickened and kept alive by the faith of the promise and by the word, shall live ruling over the earth.    Barnabas 5020
Barnabas, ch. 6

{Typology; Gen 22:9}
in order that the type established in Isaac when he was offered upon the altar might be fully accomplished.    Barnabas 5031
Barnabas, ch. 7

{Lev 16:7-10}
[This comes from a different text type:] Take one as a burnt-offering for sins. And what should they do with the other? "Accursed," says He, "is the one." Mark how the type of Jesus now comes out. "And all of you spit upon it, and pierce it, and encircle its head with scarlet wool, and thus let it be driven into the wilderness." 
. . .  And when all this has been done, he who bears the goat brings it into the desert, and takes the wool off from it, and places that upon a shrub which is called Rachia, of which also we are accustomed to eat the fruits when we find them in the field. Of this kind of shrub alone the fruits are sweet. Why then, again, is this? Give good heed. [You see] "one upon the altar, and the other accursed;" and why [do you behold] the one that is accursed crowned?    Barnabas 5036

{Num 19:2-6}
Israel, that men of the greatest wickedness should offer a heifer, and slay and burn it, and, that then boys should take the ashes, and put these into vessels, and bind round a stick purple wool along with hyssop, and that thus the boys should sprinkle the people, one by one, in order that they might be purified from their sins? Consider how He speaks to you with simplicity. The calf is Jesus: the sinful men offering it are those who led Him to the slaughter. But now the men are no longer guilty, are no longer regarded as sinners. And the boys that sprinkle are those that have proclaimed to us the remission of sins and purification of heart.    Barnabas 5050
Barnabas, ch. 8

{Num 19:6}
But why was hyssop joined with the wool? Because in His kingdom the days will be evil and polluted in which we shall be saved, [and] because he who suffers in body is cured through the cleansing efficacy of hyssop.    Barnabas 5057
Barnabas, ch. 8

{2 Cor 3:14}
And on this account the things which stand thus are clear to us, but obscure to them because they did not hear the voice of the Lord.    Barnabas 5058
Barnabas, ch. 8

{Deut 10:16; Circumcision}
But you will say, "Yea, truly the people are circumcised for a seal." But so also is every Syrian and Arab, and all the priests of idols: are these then also within the bond of His covenant? . . . Yea, the Egyptians also practice circumcision.    Barnabas 5072
Barnabas, ch. 9

{Typology; Gen 17:23}
"And Abraham circumcised ten, and eight, and three hundred men of his household." The ten and the eight are thus denoted-Ten by I, and Eight by E. You have [the initials of the, name of] Jesus. And because the cross was to express the grace [of our redemption] by the letter T, he says also, "Three Hundred." He signifies, therefore, Jesus by two letters, and the cross by one.    Barnabas 5075
Barnabas, ch. 9

{Lev 11:7-16; Deut 14:8-15; Unclean Animals}
"You shall not eat the swine, nor the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed of scales?" . . . Is there then not a command of God they should not eat [these things]? There is, but Moses spoke with a spiritual reference. For this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, "You shall not join yourself to men who resemble swine." For when they live in pleasure, they forget their Lord.    Barnabas 5080, 5082
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:13-16; Deut 14:7-15; Unclean Animals}
"The eagle, nor the hawk, nor the kite, nor the raven." . . . "You shall not join yourself," he means, "to such men as know not how to procure food for themselves by labor and sweat, but seize on that of others in their iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder others."    Barnabas 5086
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:9-12; Deut 14:9-10; Unclean Animals}
"And you shall not eat," he says, "the lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttlefish." . . .In like manner as those fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the rest, but make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom.    Barnabas 5090
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:6; Deut 14:7; Unclean Animals}
"You shall not," he says, "eat the hare." . . . Wherefore? "You shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto such." Because the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; . . . Moreover, "You shall not eat the hyena." He means, "You shall not be an adulterer, nor a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such." Wherefore? Because that animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel.    Barnabas 5093
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Lev 11:3; Unclean Animals}
"You shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant." What does he mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food, recognizes Him who nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him, is visibly made glad. . . . meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate upon the word of the Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state [to come]. Behold how well Moses legislated.    Barnabas 5105
Barnabas, ch. 10

{Jer 2:13; Acts 2:38; Baptism}
Concerning the water, indeed, it is written, in reference to the Israelites, that they should not receive that baptism which leads to the remission of sins, but should procure another for themselves. . . . "because this people has committed two great evils: they have forsaken Me, a living fountain, and have hewn out for themselves broken cisterns."    Barnabas 5113
Barnabas, ch. 11

{Isa 33:16-17; Acts 2:38; Baptism}
Furthermore, what says He in reference to the Son? "His water is sure; you shall see the King in His glory, and your soul shall meditate on the fear of the Lord." . . . Mark how He has described at once both the water and the cross. For these words imply, Blessed are they who, placing their trust in the cross, have gone down into the water; for, says He, they shall receive their reward in due time: then He declares, I will recompense them.   Barnabas 5122
Barnabas, ch. 11

{Ezek 47:12; Acts 2:38; 1 Pet 3:21; Baptism}
"And there was a river flowing on the right, and from it arose beautiful trees; and whosoever shall eat of them shall live forever." This means, that we indeed descend into the water full of sins and defilement, but come up, bearing fruit in our heart, having the fear [of God] and trust in Jesus in our spirit.    Barnabas 5126
Barnabas, ch. 11

{Gen 25:23}
"but the elder shall serve the younger: yet he also shall be blessed." . . . But let us see if this people [the Gentiles] is the heir, or the former [the Jews], and if the testament belongs to us or to them. Hear what the Scripture says concerning the people. Isaac prayed for Rebecca his wife because she was barren; and she conceived. Furthermore also, Rebeca went forth to inquire of the Lord; and the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two people in your belly; and the one people shall surpass the other, and the elder shall serve the younger."
Barnabas, ch. 13

{Typology; Gen 48:19}
And in another prophecy Jacob speaks more clearly to his son Joseph, saying, ..."And he brought Manasseh and Ephraim, desiring that Manasseh should be blessed, because he was the elder. With this view Joseph led him to the right hand of his father Jacob. But Jacob saw in spirit the type of the people to arise afterwards. And Jacob saw in spirit the type of the people to arise afterwards. And what says [the Scripture]? And Jacob changed the direction of his hands, and laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, the second and younger, and blessed him. ... You see on whom he laid [his hands], that this people should be first, and heir of the covenant. 
Barnabas, ch. 13

{Gen 15:6; Gen 17:5-6; Rom 4:2-3}
If then, still further, the same thing was intimated through Abraham, we reach the perfection of our knowledge. What, then, says He to Abraham? "Because you have believed, it is imputed to you for righteousness: behold, I have made you the father of those nations who believe in the Lord while in [a state of] uncircumcision."    Barnabas 5165
Barnabas, ch. 13

{Typology; Gen 1:31; Gen 2:1-2; 2 Pet 3:8}
Attend, my children, to the meaning of this expression, "He finished in six days." This implies that the Lord will finish all things in six thousand years, for a day is with Him a thousand years.    Barnabas 5193
Barnabas, ch. 15

{Gen 2:2-3}
He rested on the seventh day." This means: when His Son, coming [again], shall destroy the time of the wicked man, and judge the ungodly, and change the sun, and the moon, and the stars, then shall He truly rest on the seventh day.    Barnabas 5196
Barnabas, ch. 15

{Isa 1:13; Eighth Day; Lk 24:1; Jn 20:1; Acts 20:7; Sabbath; Lord's Day; Rev 1:10}
Your present sabbaths are not acceptable to Me, but that is which I have made, [namely this,] when, giving rest to all things, I shall make a beginning of the eighth day, that is, a beginning of another world. Wherefore, also, we keep the eighth day with joyfullness, the day also on which Jesus rose again from the dead.    Barnabas 5201
Barnabas, ch. 15

{Mt 7:13-14; Angels}
There are two ways of doctrine and authority, the one of light, and the other of darkness.   . . . There is a great difference between these two ways. For over one are stationed the light-bringing angels of God, but over the other the angels of Satan.    Barnabas 5230
Barnabas, ch. 18

{Rom 2:6-16; Jas 2:20-26}
The way of light, then, is as follows. If anyone desires to travel to the appointed place, he must be zealous in his works.    Barnabas 5234
Barnabas, ch. 19

{Ex 21:22-25; Abortion}
"If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman's husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eYou for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. . . . You shall not slay the child by procuring abortion; nor, again, shall you destroy it after it is born.    Barnabas 5243
Barnabas, ch. 19

{Mt 5:42; Heb 10:25; Lk 16:9; Jas 5:20}
"Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away." . . . 
You shall communicate in all things with your neighbor; you shall not call things your own; for if you are partakers in common of things which are incorruptible, how much more [should you be] of those things which are corruptible!  . . . Do not be ready to stretch forth your hands to take, whilst you contract them back to give. . . . You shall love, as the apple of your eye, everyonethat speaks to you the word of the Lord. You shall remember the day of judgment, night and day. You shall seek out every day the faces of the saints, either by word examining them, and going to exhort them, and meditating how to save a soul by the word, or by your hands you shall labor for the redemption of your sins. You shall not hesitate to give, nor murmur when you givest. "Give to everyonethat asks you," and you shall know who is the good Recompenser of the reward. You shall preserve what you have received [in charge], neither adding to it nor taking from it.    Barnabas 5252
Barnabas, ch. 19

{Mt 5:9; Mt 7:13-14}
"Blessed are the peacemakers, For they shall be called sons of God." . . .To the last you shall hate the Wicked [One]. You shall judge righteously. You shall not make a schism, but you shall pacify those that contend by bringing them together. You shall confess your sins. You shall not go to prayer with an evil conscience. This is the way of light.    Barnabas 5257
Barnabas, ch. 19

{Mt 5:42; Jas 5:1-6}
"Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away." . . . who turn away Him who is in want, who oppress the afflicted, who are advocates of the rich, who are unjust judges of the poor, and who are in every respect transgressors.    Barnabas 5267
Barnabas, ch. 20

{Rev 20:12-13; Rom 2:6-11; Jn 5:38-39}
It is well, therefore, that he who has learned the judgments of the Lord, as many as have been written, should walk in them. For he who keeps these shall be glorified in the kingdom of God; but he who chooses other things shall be destroyed with his works. On this account there will be a resurrection, on this account a retribution.    Barnabas 5269
Barnabas, ch. 21

{Isa 54:1; Gal 4:27}
"Rejoice, you barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, you that travailest not; for she that is desolate has many more children than she that has an husband." In that He said, "Rejoice, you barren that bearest not," He referred to us, for our Church was barren before that children were given to her. . . . And in that He said, "For she that is desolate has many more children than she that has an husband," He means that our people seemed to be outcast from God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous than those who are reckoned to possess God.    location 141281
2nd Clement, Ch. 2

{Mt 9:13; Lk 5:32}
And another Scripture saith, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." This means that those who are perishing must be saved. For it is indeed a great and admirable thing to establish, not the things which are standing, but these that are falling.    location 141282

For He Himself declares, "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess before My Father." This, then, is our reward if we shall confess Him by whom we have been saved. But in what way shall we confess Him? By doing what He says, and not transgressing His commandments, and by honoring Him not with our lips only, but with all our heart and all our mind. . . . Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He saith, "Not everyonethat says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that works righteousness." Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by our works, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but being continent, compassionate, and good. . . . For this reason, if we should do such wicked things, the Lord has said, "Even though you were gathered together to me in My very bosom, yet if you were not to keep My commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from Me; I know you not whence you are, you workers of iniquity." location 141298

By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires upon them?

*[A certain presbyter, of whom see Apost. Constitutions, vii. 46, where he is said to have been ordained by St. John, the Evangelist. ref.]
Papias, who is now mentioned by us, affirms that he received the sayings of the apostles from those who accompanied them, and he moreover asserts that he heard in person Aristion and the presbyter John*. Accordingly he mentions them frequently by name, and in his writings gives their traditions. Our notice of these circumstances may not be without its use. It may also be worthwhile to add to the statements of Papias already given, other passages of his in which he relates some miraculous deeds, stating that he acquired the knowledge of them from tradition.

The residence of the Apostle Philip with his daughters in Hierapolis has been mentioned above.

Papias also mentions another miracle relating to Justus, surnamed Barsabas, how he swallowed a deadly poison, and received no harm, on account of the grace of the Lord.
The same person [Papias], moreover, has set down other things as coming to him from unwritten tradition, among these some strange parables and instructions of the Savior, and some other things of a more fabulous nature. Among these he says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection from the dead, when the personal reign of Christ will be established on this earth. He moreover hands down, in his own writing, other narratives given by the previously mentioned Aristion of the Lord's sayings, and the traditions of
the presbyter John. For information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves.

importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words: "And the presbyter said this: Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took special care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark]

So also they erred who believed that the sun is a god.

And to it there belongs by comparison a part in common with the rest of the stars in its course;  . . . and that not according to its own will but rather according to the will of him who rules it.

*This seems to refer to the practice of Jews in fixing the beginning of the day, and consequently of the Sabbath, from the rising of the stars. They used to say, that when three stars of moderate magnitude appeared, it was night; when two, it was twilight; and when only one, that day had not yet departed. It thus came to pass (according to their night-day reckoning), that whosoever engaged in work on the evening of Friday, the beginning of the Sabbath, after three stars of moderate size were visible, was held to have sinned, and had to present a trespass-offering; and so on, according to the fanciful rule described.(from Coptic Reference Site)

For the Christians are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit cities of their own, nor employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life which is marked out by any singularity. . . . But, inhabiting Greek as well as barbarian cities, according as the lot of each of them has determined, and following the customs of the natives in respect to clothing, food, and the rest of their ordinary conduct, they display to us their wonderful and confessedly striking method of life.  . . .

For he who inquires of a false prophet in regard to any action is an idolater, and devoid of the truth, and foolish. For no spirit given by God requires to be asked; but such a spirit having the power of Divinity speaks all things of itself. . . . "I will tell you," says he, "about both the prophets, and then you can try the true and the false prophet according to my directions. Try the man who has the Divine Spirit by his life. First, he who has the Divine Spirit proceeding from above is meek, and peaceable, and humble, and refrains from all iniquity and the vain desire of this world, and contents himself with fewer wants than those of other men, and when asked he makes no reply; nor does he speak privately, nor when man wishes the spirit to speak does the Holy Spirit speak, but it speaks only when God wishes it to speak. When, then, a man having the Divine Spirit comes into an assembly of righteous men who have faith in the Divine Spirit, and this assembly of men offers up prayer to God, then the angel of the prophetic Spirit, who is destined for him, fills the man; and the man being filled with the Holy Spirit, speaks to the multitude as the Lord wishes. Thus, then, will the Spirit of Divinity become manifest. . . . The man who seems to have the Spirit exalts himself, and wishes to have the first seat, and is bold, and impudent, and talkative, and lives in the midst of many luxuries and many other delusions, and takes rewards for his prophecy; and if he does not receive rewards, he does not prophesy. . . .

"Why, sir," I said, "did these stones ascend out of the pit, and be applied to the building of the tower, after having borne these spirits?" "They were obliged," he answered, "to ascend through water in order that they might be made alive; for, unless they laid aside the deadness of their life, they could not in any other way enter into the kingdom of God. Accordingly, those also who fell asleep received the seal of the Son of God. For," he continued, "before a man bears the name of the Son of God, he is dead; but when he receives the seal he lays aside his deadness, and obtains life. The seal, then, is the water: they descend into the water dead, and they arise alive.

Accordingly they descended with them into the water, and again ascended. [But these descended alive and rose up again alive; whereas they who had previously fallen asleep descended dead, but rose up again alive.] By these, then, were they quickened and made to know the name of the Son of God. . . .

{Acts 8:9-10; Simon Magus}
There was a Samaritan, Simon, a native of the village called Gitto, who in the reign of Claudius Caesar, and in your royal city of Rome, did mighty acts of magic, by virtue of the art of the devils operating in him. . . . He was considered a god, and as a god was honored by you with a statue, which statue was erected on the river Tiber, between the two bridges, and bore this inscription, in the language of Rome:-"Simoni Deo Sancto," "To Simon the holy God." And almost all the Samaritans, and a few even of other nations, worship him, and acknowledge him as the first god. . . . Menander, also a Samaritan, of the town Capparetaea, a disciple of Simon, and inspired by devils, we know to have deceived many while he was in Antioch by his magical art. He persuaded those who adhered to Him who they should never die, and even now there are some living who hold this opinion of his.    location 5643

So now we see you rear children only for this shameful use; and for this pollution a multitude of females and hermaphrodites, and those who commit unmentionable iniquities, are found in every nation. . . .

{Messianic Prophecies; Ps 1:1-6; Ps 2:1-12}
And we have thought it right and relevant to mention some other prophetic utterances of David besides these; from which you may learn how the Spirit of prophecy exhorts men to live, and how He foretold the conspiracy which was formed against Christ by Herod the king of the Jews, and the Jews themselves, and Pilate, who was your governor among them, with his soldiers; and how He should be believed on by men of every race; and how God calls Him His Son, and has declared that He will subdue all His enemies under Him; and how the devils, as much as they can, strive to escape the power of God the Father and Lord of all, and the power of Christ Himself; and how God calls all to repentance before the day of judgment comes. These things were uttered thus: "Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful: but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law will he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, which shall give his fruit in his season; and his leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever he does shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous. For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish. Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine new things? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast their yoke from us. He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak to them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I been set by Him a King on Zion His holy hill, declaring the decree of the Lord. The Lord said to Me, you are My Son; this day have I begotten You. Ask of Me, and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth as your possession. You shall herd them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall you dash them in pieces. Be wise now, therefore, O you kings; be instructed, all you judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Embrace instruction, lest at any time the Lord be angry, and you perish from the right way, when His wrath has been suddenly kindled. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him."

{Ps 96:11-13; Messianic Prophecies}
 And again, in another prophecy, the Spirit of prophecy, through the same David, intimated that Christ, after He had been crucified, should reign, and spoke as follows: . . . "Give Glory to the Lord, the Father everlasting. Receive grace, and enter His presence, and worship in His holy courts. Let all the earth fear before His face; let it be established, and not shaken.

{Rom 2:6-11; Deut 30:19-20; Isa 1:16-20; Rev 22:11-12; Free Will}
But lest some suppose, from what has been said by us, that we say that whatever happens, happens by a fatal necessity, because it is foretold as known beforehand, this too we explain. We have learned from the prophets, and we hold it to be true, that punishments, and chastisements, and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of each man's actions. Since if it be not so, but all things happen by fate, neither is anything at all in our own power. . . . For if it be fated that this man, e.g., be good, and this other evil, neither is the former meritorious nor the latter to be blamed. And again, unless the human race have the power of avoiding evil and choosing good by free choice, they are not accountable for their actions, of whatever kind they be. But that it is by free choice they both walk uprightly and stumble, we thus demonstrate. We see the same man making a transition to opposite things. Now, if it had been fated that he were to be either good or bad, he could never have been capable of both the opposites. . . . But this we assert is inevitable fate, that they who choose the good have worthy rewards, and they who choose the opposite have their merited awards. For not like other things, as trees and quadrupeds, which cannot act by choice, did God make man: for neither would he be worthy of reward or praise did he not of himself choose the good, but were created for this end; nor, if he were evil, would he be worthy of punishment, not being evil of himself, but being able to be nothing else than what he was made.  . . . "Wash you, make you clean; put away evils from your souls; learn to do well; judge the orphan, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together, says the Lord: And if your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool; and if they be red like as crimson, I will make them white as snow. And if you be willing and obey Me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you do not obey Me, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it." . . . And so, too, Plato, when he says, "The blame is his who chooses, and God is blameless," [Rep. 10] took this from the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers.       location 5852

{Isa 1:19-20}
And if you be willing and obey Me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you do not obey Me, the sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it."1857 And that expression, "The sword shall devour you," does not mean that the disobedient shall be slain by the sword, but the sword of God is fire, of which they who choose to do wickedly become the fuel. Wherefore He says, "The sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it." And if He had spoken concerning a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have said, shall devour.

{Moses; Acts 17:26-30; Rom 1:19-20}
And so, too, Plato, when he says, "The blame is his who chooses, and God is blameless*," [Rep. x] took this from the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers. . . . They have received such suggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to understand and interpret these things. And hence there seem to be seeds of truth among all men; but they are charged with not accurately understanding [the truth] when they assert contradictories.    location 5860

So that what we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being His decree that the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to the merit of the actions done, always urging the human race to effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for men.    location 5862

These are his words: "The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit you at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool. The Lord shall send to you the rod of power out of Jerusalem; and rule you in the midst of your enemies. With you is the government in the day of your power, in the beauties of your saints: from the womb of morning have I begotten You." That which he says, "He shall send to you the rod of power out of Jerusalem," is predictive of the mighty, word, which His apostles, going forth from Jerusalem, preached everywhere; and though death is decreed against those who teach or at all confess the name of Christ, we everywhere both embrace and teach it.    location 5876

They are these: "Sion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. The house of our sanctuary has become a curse, and the glory which our fathers blessed is burned up with fire, and all its glorious things are laid waste: and you refrain Yourself at these things, and have held your peace, and have humbled us very sore."

And again, how it was said by the same Isaiah, that the Gentile nations who were not looking for Him should worship Him, but the Jews who always expected Him should not recognize Him when He came. And the words are spoken as from the person of Christ; and they are these: "I was manifest to them that asked not for Me; I was found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold Me, to a nation that called not on My name. I spread out My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to those who walked in a way that is not good, but follow after their own sins, a people who provoke me to anger to my face." For the Jews having the prophecies, and being always in expectation of the Christ to come, did not recognize Him; and not only so, but even treated Him shamefully. But the Gentiles, who had never heard anything about Christ, until the apostles set out from Jerusalem and preached concerning Him, and gave them the prophecies, were filled with joy and faith, and cast away their idols, and dedicated themselves to the Unbegotten God through Christ.     location 5909

{Lk 24:44; Messianic Prophecies}
Since, then, we prove that all things which have already happened had been predicted by the prophets before they came to pass, we must necessarily believe also that those things which are in like manner predicted, but are yet to come to pass, shall certainly happen. For the prophets have proclaimed two advents of His: the one, that which is already past, when He came as a dishonored and suffering Man; but the second, when, according to prophecy, He shall come from heaven with glory, accompanied by His angelic host, when also He shall raise the bodies of all men who have lived, and shall clothe those of the worthy with immortality, and shall send those of the wicked, endued with eternal sensibility, into everlasting fire with the wicked devils. And that these things also have been foretold as yet to be, we will prove.    location 5946

And then in Jerusalem there shall be great lamentation, not the lamentation of mouths or of lips, but the lamentation of the heart; and they shall rend not their garments, but their hearts. Tribe by tribe they shall mourn, and then they shall look on Him whom they have pierced; and they shall say, Why, O Lord, have you made us to err from your way?

Yes, seeing ourselves too, and knowing that the Christians from among the Gentiles are both more numerous and more true than those from among the Jews and Samaritans?    
For all the other human races are called Gentiles by the Spirit of prophecy; but the Jewish and Samaritan races are called the tribe of Israel, and the house of Jacob. And the prophecy in which it was predicted that there should be more believers from the Gentiles than from the Jews and Samaritans, we will produce: it ran thus: "Rejoice, O barren, you that do not bear; break forth and shout, you that do not travail, because many more are the children of the desolate than of her that has an husband." For all the Gentiles were "desolate" of the true God, serving the works of their hands; but the Jews and Samaritans, having the word of God delivered to them by the prophets, and always expecting the Christ, did not recognize Him when He came, except some few, of whom the Spirit of prophecy by Isaiah had predicted that they should be saved. He spoke as from their person: "Except the Lord had left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom and Gomorrah."  location 5972

And to show how those from among the Gentiles were foretold as more true and more believing, we will cite what was said by Isaiah the prophet [actually, Jeremeiah]; for he spoke as follows "Israel is uncircumcised in heart, but the Gentiles are uncircumcised in the flesh." So many things therefore, as these, when they are seen with the eye, are enough to produce conviction and belief in those who embrace the truth, and are not bigoted in their opinions, nor are governed by their passions.

{Mythology; Pagan Religion}
But those who hand down the Mythology which the poets have made, adduce no proof to the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvelous tales, like the things which were said by the poets.

{Gen 49:10; Messianic Prophecies; Mt 21:2-5}
The prophet Moses, then, was, as we have already said, older than all writers; and by him, as we have also said before, it was thus predicted: "There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved; and He shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His robe in the blood of the grape." The devils, accordingly, when they heard these prophetic words, said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter, . . . the name of "foal" could mean either the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse.

{Form of the Cross}
But in no instance, not even in any of those called sons of Jupiter, did the demons imitate His being crucified; for it was not understood by them, all the things said of it having been put symbolically. And this, as the prophet foretold, is the greatest symbol of His power and role; as is also proved by the things which fall under our observation. For consider all the things in the world, whether without this form they could be administered or have any community. For the sea is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the ship; and the earth is not ploughed without it: diggers and mechanics do not their work, except with tools which have this shape.    location 6005

Then they are brought by us where there is water, and are regenerated in the same manner in which we were ourselves regenerated.

And the command, too, given by the priests to those who enter and worship in the temples, that they take off their shoes, the devils, learning what happened to the above-mentioned prophet Moses, have given in imitation of these things. For at that juncture, when Moses was ordered to go down into Egypt and lead out the people of the Israelites who were there, and while he was tending the flocks of his maternal uncle [probably confusing this with Jacob] in the land of Arabia, our Christ conversed with him under the appearance of fire from a bush, and said, "Put off your shoes, and draw near and hear." And he, when he had put off his shoes and drawn near, heard that he was to go down into Egypt and lead out the people of the Israelites there; and he received mighty power from Christ, who spoke to him in the appearance of fire.

And all the Jews even now teach that the nameless God spoke to Moses; whence the Spirit of prophecy, accusing them by Isaiah the prophet mentioned above, said "The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel does not know Me, and My people do not understand." And Jesus the Christ, because the Jews knew not what the Father was, and what the Son, in like manner accused them; and Himself said, "No one knows the Father, but the Son; nor the Son, but the Father, and they to whom the Son reveals Him."

Now the Word of God is His Son, as we have before said. And He is called Angel and Apostle; for He declares whatever we ought to know, and is sent forth to declare whatever is revealed; as our Lord Himself says, "He that heareth Me, heareth Him who sent Me." From the writings of Moses also this will be manifest; for thus it is written in them, "And the Angel of God spoke to Moses, in a flame of fire out of the bush, and said, I am that I am, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of your fathers; go down into Egypt, and bring forth My people." And if you wish to learn what follows, you can do so from the same writings; for it is impossible to relate the whole here. But so much is written for the sake of proving that Jesus the Christ is the Son of God and His Apostle, being of old the Word, and appearing sometimes in the form of fire, and sometimes in the likeness of angels; but now, by the will of God, having become man for the human race, He endured all the sufferings which the devils instigated the senseless Jews to inflict upon Him; 
Justin Martyr, First Apology, Ch.63

{Ex 3:4-6; Isa 1:3; Mt 11:27; 1 Jn 2:23; Deity of Christ; Atonement}
[The Jews] who, though they have it expressly affirmed in the writings of Moses, "And the angel of God spoke to Moses in a flame of fire in a bush, and said, I am that I am, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," yet maintain that He who said this was the Father and Creator of the universe. Whence also the Spirit of prophecy rebukes them, and says, "Israel does not know Me, my people have not understood Me." And again, Jesus, as we have already shown, while He was with them, said, "No one knows the Father, but the Son; nor the Son but the Father, and those to whom the Son will reveal Him." The Jews, accordingly, being throughout of opinion that it was the Father of the universe who spoke to Moses, though He who spoke to him was indeed the Son of God, who is called both Angel and Apostle, are justly charged, both by the Spirit of prophecy and by Christ Himself, with knowing neither the Father nor the Son. For they who affirm that the Son is the Father, are proved neither to have become acquainted with the Father, nor to know that the Father of the universe has a Son; who also, being the first-begotten Word of God, is even God. And of old He appeared in the shape of fire and in the likeness of an angel to Moses and to the other prophets; but now in the times of your empire, having, as we before said, become Man by a virgin, according to the counsel of the Father, for the salvation of those who believe on Him, He endured both to be set at nought and to suffer, that by dying and rising again He might conquer death. And that which was said out of the bush to Moses, "I am that I am, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and the God of your fathers," this signified that they, even though dead, are yet in existence, and are men belonging to Christ Himself.

Accordingly, if the inhabitants of your province will so far sustain this petition of theirs as to accuse the Christians in some court of law, I do not prohibit them from doing so. But I will not suffer them to make use of mere entreaties and outcries. For it is far more just, if anyone desires to make an accusation, that you give judgment upon it. If, therefore, anyone makes the accusation, and furnishes proof that the said men do anything contrary to the laws, you shall adjudge punishments in proportion to the offences. And this, by Hercules, you shall give special heed to, that if any man shall, through mere calumny, bring an accusation against any of these persons, you shall award to him more severe punishments in proportion to his wickedness.   location 6174, 6175

Epistle of Antoninus to the common assembly of Asia    location 6179
The Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Adrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Supreme Pontiff,  in the fifteenth year of his tribuneship, Consul for the third time, Father of the fatherland, to the Common Assembly of Asia, greeting: I should have thought that the gods themselves would see to it that such offenders should not escape. For if they had the power, they themselves would much rather punish those who refuse to worship them; but it is you who bring trouble on these persons, and accuse as the opinion of atheists that which they hold, and lay to their charge certain other things which we are unable to prove. But it would be advantageous to them that they should be thought to die for that of which they are accused, and they conquer you by being lavish of their lives rather than yield that obedience which you require of them. And regarding the earthquakes which have already happened and are now occurring, it is not seemly that you remind us of them, losing heart whenever they occur, and thus set your conduct in contrast with that of these men; for they have much greater confidence towards God than you yourselves have. And you, indeed, seem at such 187 times to ignore the gods, and you neglect the temples, and make no recognition of the worship of God. And hence you are jealous of those who do serve Him, and persecute them to the death. Concerning such persons, some others also of the governors of provinces wrote to my most divine father; to whom he replied that they should not at all disturb such persons, unless they were found to be attempting anything against the Roman government. And to myself many have sent intimations regarding such persons, to whom I also replied in pursuance of my father's judgment. But if anyone has a matter to bring against any person of this class, merely as such a person, let the accused be acquitted of the charge, even though he should be found to be such a person; but let the accuser be amenable to justice.

{Persecution; Mt 5:13-14; Rom 8:37; Jn 16:33; 1 Cor 15:57}
Epistle of Marcus Aurelius to the senate, in which he testifies that the Christians were the cause of his victory. . . .  Having then examined my own position, and my host, with respect to the vast mass of barbarians and of the enemy, I quickly betook myself to prayer to the gods of my country. But being disregarded by them, I summoned those who among us go by the name of Christians. And having made inquiry, I discovered a great number and vast host of them, and raged against them, which was by no means becoming; for afterwards I learned their power. Wherefore they began the battle, not by preparing weapons, nor arms, nor bugles; for such preparation is hateful to them, on account of the God they bear about in their conscience. Therefore it is probable that those whom we suppose to be atheists, have God as their ruling power entrenched in their conscience. For having cast themselves on the ground, they prayed not only for me, but also for the whole army as it stood, that they might be delivered from the present thirst and famine. For during five days we had got no water, because there was none; for we were in the heart of Germany, and in the enemy's territory. And simultaneously with their casting themselves on the ground, and praying to God (a God of whom I am ignorant), water poured from heaven, upon us most refreshingly cool, but upon the enemies of Rome a withering hail. And immediately we recognized the presence of God following on the prayer -a God unconquerable and indestructible. Founding upon this, then, let us pardon such as are Christians, lest they pray for and obtain such a weapon against ourselves. And I counsel that no such person be accused on the ground of his being a Christian.

Foreverywhere, whoever is corrected by father, or neighbor, or child, or friend, or brother, or husband, or wife, for a fault, for being hard to move, for loving pleasure and being hard to urge to what is right (except those who have been persuaded that the unjust and intemperate shall be punished in eternal fire, but that the virtuous and those who lived like Christ shall dwell with God in a state that is free from suffering,-we mean, those who have become Christians), . . . incite them, as rulers actuated by evil spirits, to put us to death.  location 6222

{Persecution; 1 Cor 7:10-16; 1 Pet 3:1}
A certain woman lived with an intemperate husband; she herself, too, having formerly been intemperate. But when she came to the knowledge of the teachings of Christ she became sober-minded, and endeavored to persuade her husband likewise to be temperate, citing the teaching of Christ, and assuring Him who there shall be punishment in eternal fire inflicted upon those who do not live temperately and conformably to right reason. But he, continuing in the same excesses, alienated his wife from him by his actions. . . . When she was persuaded by her friends, who advised her still to continue with him, in the idea that some time or other her husband might give hope of amendment, she did violence to her own feeling and remained with him.   location 6234

{1 Cor 7:10-16}
When she [a new Christian] was persuaded by her friends, who advised her still to continue with him [an unbelieving husband], in the idea that some time or other her husband might give hope of amendment, she did violence to her own feeling and remained with him. For she, considering it wicked to live any longer as a wife with a husband who sought in every way means of indulging in pleasure contrary to the law of nature, and in violation of what is right, wished to be divorced from him. And when she was overpersuaded by her friends, who advised her still to continue with him, in the idea that some time or other her husband might give hope of amendment, she did violence to her own feeling and remained with him. But when her husband had gone into Alexandria, and was reported to be conducting himself worse than ever, she-that she might not, by continuing in matrimonial connection with him, and by sharing his table and his bed, become a partaker also in his wickednesses and impieties-gave him what you call a bill of repudiation [Gr. repondion; Latin repudium] and was separated from him. But this noble husband of hers--while he ought to have been rejoicing that those actions which formerly she unhesitatingly committed with the servants and hirelings, when she delighted in drunkenness and every vice, she had now given up, and desired that he too should give up the same,-when she had gone from him without his desire, brought an accusation against her, affirming that she was a Christian. And she presented a paper to you, the Emperor, requesting that first she be permitted to arrange her affairs, and afterwards to make her defense against the accusation, when her affairs were set in order. And this you granted. And her former [quondam] husband, since he was now no longer able to prosecute her, directed his assaults against a man, Ptolemaeus, whom Urbicus punished, and who had been her teacher in the Christian doctrines.   location 6237

[God] committed the care of men and of all things under heaven to angels whom He appointed over them. But the angels transgressed this appointment, and were captivated by love of women, and begot children who are those that are called demons; and besides, they afterwards subdued the human race to themselves, partly by magical writings, and partly by fears and the punishments they occasioned, and partly by teaching them to offer sacrifices, and incense, and libations, of which things they stood in need after they were enslaved by lustful passions; and among men they sowed murders, wars, adulteries, intemperate deeds, and all wickedness.  Whence also the poets and mythologists, not knowing that it was the angels and those demons who had been begotten by them that did these things to men, and women, and cities, and nations, which they related, ascribed them to god himself, and to those who were accounted to be his very offspring, and to the offspring of those who were called his brothers, Neptune and Pluto, and to the children again of these their offspring.

The Stoicism, not observing this, maintained that all things take place according to the necessity of fate. But since God in the beginning made the race of angels and men with free-will, they will justly suffer in eternal fire the punishment of whatever sins they have committed. And this is the nature of all that is made, to be capable of vice and virtue. For neither would any of them be praiseworthy unless there were power to turn to both [virtue and vice].  . . . For if they say that human actions come to pass by fate, they . . . have looked on God Himself as emerging both in part and in whole in every wickedness; or that neither vice nor virtue is anything; which is contrary to every sound idea, reason, and sense. location 6314

And if one object that the laws of men are diverse, and say that with some, one thing is considered good, another evil, while with others what seemed bad to the former is esteemed good, and what seemed good is esteemed bad, let him listen to what we say to this. We know that the wicked angels appointed laws conformable to their own wickedness, in which the men who are like them delight; and the right Reason [Jesus] when He came, proved that not all opinions nor all doctrines are good, but that some are evil, while others are good.

{Greek Philosophy; Mythology; Socrates; Pagan Religion}
And those who by human birth were more ancient than Christ, when they attempted to consider and prove things by reason, were brought before the tribunals as impious persons and busybodies. And Socrates, who was more zealous in this direction than all of them, was accused of the very same crimes as ourselves. For they said that he was introducing new divinities, and did not consider those to be gods whom the state recognized. But he cast out from the state both Homer and the rest of the poets, and taught men to reject the wicked demons and those who did the things which the poets related; and he exhorted them to become acquainted with the God who was to them unknown, by means of the investigation of reason, saying, "That it is neither easy to find the Father and Maker of all, nor, having found Him, is it safe to declare Him to all."   location 6344

{Mt 5:28-29; Rom 2:6-10}
And we judge it right and opportune to tell here . . . what is related by Xenophon. Hercules, says Xenophon, coming to a place where three ways met, found Virtue and Vice, who appeared to him in the form of women: Vice, in a luxurious dress, and with a seductive expression rendered blooming by such ornaments, and her eyes of a quickly melting tenderness, said to Hercules that if he would follow her, she would always enable him to pass his life in pleasure and adorned with the most graceful ornaments, such as were then upon her own person. And Virtue, who was of squalid look and dress, said, "But if you obey me, you shall adorn yourself not with ornament nor beauty that passes away and perishes, but with everlasting and precious graces." And we are persuaded that everyone who flees those things that seem to be good, and follows hard after what are reckoned difficult and strange, enters into blessedness. For Vice, when by imitation of what is incorruptible (for what is really incorruptible she neither has nor can produce) she has thrown around her own actions, as a disguise, the properties of virtue, and qualities which are really excellent, leads captive earthly-minded men, attaching to virtue her own evil properties. But those who understood the excellences which belong to that which is real, are also uncorrupt in virtue.

{Accusations Against Christians, False; Pagan Religion; Father and Son; Persecution}
For I myself, too, when I was delighting in the doctrines of Plato, and heard the Christians slandered, and saw them fearless of death, and of all other-things which are counted fearful, perceived that it was impossible that they could be living in wickedness and pleasure. For what sensual or intemperate man, or who that counts it good to feast on human flesh, could welcome death that he might be deprived of his enjoyments, and would not rather continue always the present life, and attempt to escape the observation of the rulers; and much less would he denounce himself when the consequence would be death? This also the wicked demons have now caused to be done by evil men. For having put some to death on account of the accusations falsely brought against us, they also dragged to the torture our domestics, either children or weak women, and by dreadful torments forced them to admit those fabulous actions which they themselves openly perpetrate; about which we are the less concerned, because none of these actions are really ours, and we have the unbegotten and ineffable God as witness both of our thoughts and deeds. For why did we not even publicly profess that these were the things which we esteemed good, and prove that these are the divine philosophy, saying that the mysteries of Saturn are performed when we slay a man, and that when we drink our fill of blood, as it is said we do, we are doing what you do before that idol you honor, and on which you sprinkle the blood not only of irrational animals, but also of men, making a libation of the blood of the slain by the hand of the most illustrious and noble man among you? And imitating Jupiter and the other gods in sodomy and shameless intercourse with woman, might we not bring as our apology the writings of Epicurus and the poets? But because we persuade men to avoid such instruction, and all who practice them and imitate such examples, as now in this discourse we have striven to persuade you, we are assailed in every kind of way. But we are not concerned, since we know that God is a just observer of all. But would that even now someone would mount a lofty rostrum, and shout with a loud voice; "Be ashamed, be ashamed, you who charge the guiltless with those deeds which yourselves openly could commit, and ascribe things which apply to yourselves and to your gods to those who have not even the slightest sympathy with them.   location 6383

For I myself, when I discovered tile wicked disguise which the evil spirits had thrown around the divine doctrines of the Christians, to turn aside others from joining them, laughed both at those who framed these falsehoods, and at the disguise itself and at popular opinion and I confess that I both boast and with all my strength strive to be found a Christian; not because the teachings of Plato are different from those of Christ, but because they are not in all respects similar, as neither are those of the others, Stoicism, and poets, and historians. For each man spoke well in proportion to the share he had of the spermatic Logos, seeing what was related to it. But they who contradict themselves on the more important points appear not to have possessed the heavenly wisdom, and the knowledge which cannot be spoken against. Whatever things were rightly said among all men, are the property of us Christians. For next to God, we worship and love the Logos who is from the unbegotten and ineffable God, since also He became man for our sakes, that becoming a partaker of our sufferings, He might also bring us healing. For all the writers were able to see realities darkly through the sowing of the implanted Logos that was in them. For the seed and imitation impacted according to capacity is one thing, and quite another is the thing itself, of which there is the participation and imitation according to the grace which is from Him.  location 6390

{Greek Philosophy}
[Justin]: But the most have not taken thought of this whether there be one or more gods, and whether they have a regard for each one of us or no, as if this knowledge contributed nothing to our happiness; nay, they moreover attempt to persuade us that God takes care of the universe with its genera and species, but not of me and you, and each individually, since otherwise we would surely not need to pray to Him night and day. But it is not difficult to understand the upshot of this; for fearlessness and license in speaking result to such as maintain these opinions, doing and saying whatever they choose, neither dreading punishment nor hoping for any benefit from God. For how could they? They affirm that the same things shall always happen; and, further, that I and you shall again live in like manner, having become neither better men nor worse. But there are some others, who, having supposed the soul to be immortal and immaterial, believe that though they have committed evil they will not suffer punishment (for that which is immaterial is insensible), and that the soul, in consequence of its immortality, needs nothing from God." location 6433

But if the world is begotten, souls also are necessarily begotten; and perhaps at one time they were not in existence, for they were made on account of men and other living creatures, if you will say that they have been begotten wholly apart, and not along with their respective bodies.' . . .

{Mt 25:46; Rev 14:11; Soul; Afterlife; Father and Son; Jn 1:18}
[A Christian witnessing to Justin before Justin's conversion:] "'But I do not say, indeed, that all souls die; for that were truly a piece of good fortune to the evil. What then? The souls of the pious remain in a better place, while those of the unjust and wicked are in a worse, waiting for the time of judgment. Thus some which have appeared worthy of God never die; but others are punished so long as God wills them to exist and to be punished.'"
. . .
[Unconverted Justin]: "'Is what you say, then, of a like nature with that which Plato in Timaeus hints about the world, when he says that it is indeed subject to decay, inasmuch as it has been created, but that it will neither be dissolved nor meet with the fate of death on account of the will of God? Does it seem to you the very same can be said of the soul, and generally of all things? For those things which exist after God, or shall at any time exist, these have the nature of decay, and are such as may be blotted out and cease to exist; for God alone is unbegotten and incorruptible, and therefore He is God, but all other things after Him are created and corruptible. For this reason souls both die and are punished: since, if they were unbegotten, they would neither sin, nor be filled with folly, nor be cowardly, and again ferocious; nor would they willingly transform into swine, and serpents, and dogs and it would not indeed be just to compel them, if they be unbegotten. For that which is unbegotten is similar to, equal to, and the same with that which is unbegotten; and neither in power nor in honor should the one be preferred to the other, and hence there are not many things which are unbegotten: for if there were some difference between them, you would not discover the cause of the difference, though you searched for it; but after letting the mind ever wander to infinity, you  would at length, wearied out, take your stand on one Unbegotten, and say that this is the Cause of  all.

[Justin]: "Did such escape the observation of Plato and Pythagoras, those wise men,' I said, 'who have been as a wall and fortress of philosophy to us?' 
Chapter VI. 
[Christian]: "'It makes no matter to me,' said he, 'whether Plato or Pythagoras, or, in short, any other man held such opinions. For the truth is so; and you would perceive it from this. The soul assuredly is or has life. If, then, it is life, it would cause something else, and not itself, to live, even as motion would move something else than itself. Now, that the soul lives, no one would deny. But if it lives, it lives not as being life, but as the partaker of life; but that which partakes of anything, is different from that of which it does partake. Now the soul partakes of life, since God wills it to live. Thus, then, it will not even partake [of life] when God does not will it to live. For to live is not its attribute, as it is God's; but as a man does not live always, and the soul is not forever conjoined with the body, since, whenever this harmony must be broken up, the soul leaves the body, and the man exists no longer; even so, whenever the soul must cease to exist, the spirit of life is removed from it, and there is no more soul, but it goes back to the place from whence it was taken.'

For if you remain in that mode of philosophy, and live blamelessly, a hope of a better destiny were left to you; but when you have forsaken God, and reposed confidence in man, what safety still awaits you? If, then, you are willing to listen to me (for I have already considered you a friend), first be circumcised, then observe what ordinances have been enacted with respect to the Sabbath, and the feasts, and the new moons of God; and, in a word, do all things which have been written in the Law: and then perhaps you shall obtain mercy from God.

{Sabbath; Acts 15:5; Gal 5:2-4; Gal 4:9-11}
[Trypho:] Moreover, I am aware that your precepts in the so-called Gospel are so wonderful and so great, that I suspect no one can keep them; for I have carefully read them. But this is what we are most at a loss about: that you, professing to be pious, and supposing yourselves better than others, are not in any particular separated from them, and do not alter your mode of living from the nations, in that you observe no festivals, or sabbaths, and do not have the rite of circumcision; and further, resting your hopes on a man that was crucified, you yet expect to obtain some good thing from God, while you do not obey His commandments. Have you not read, that that soul shall be cut off from his people who shall not have been circumcised on the eighth day? And this has been ordained for strangers and for slaves equally. But you, despising this covenant rashly, reject the consequent duties, and attempt to persuade yourselves that you know God, when, however, you perform none of those things which they do who fear God    location 6633

Nor do we think that there is one God for us, another for you, but that He alone is God who led your fathers out from Egypt with a strong hand and a high arm. Nor have we trusted in any other (for there is no other), but in Him in whom you also have trusted, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. But we do not trust through Moses or through the Law for then we would do the same as yourselves. But  now-(for I have read that there shall be a final law, and a covenant, the supreme of all, which it is now incumbent on all men to observe, as many as are seeking after the inheritance of God. For the law promulgated on Horeb is now old, and belongs to yourselves alone; but this is for all universally. Now, law placed against law has abrogated that which is before it, and a covenant which comes after in like manner has put an end to the previous one; and an eternal and final law-namely, Christ -has been given to us, and the covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no law, no commandment, no ordinance. Have you not read this which Isaiah says: 'Hearken unto Me, hearken unto Me, my people; and, you kings, give ear unto Me: for a law shall go forth from Me, and My judgment shall be for a light to the nations. My righteousness approaches swiftly, and My salvation shall go forth, and nations shall trust in mine arm?' And by Jeremiah, concerning this same new covenant, He thus speaks: 'Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt). If, therefore, God proclaimed a new covenant which was to be instituted, and this for a light of the nations, we see and are persuaded that men approach God, leaving their idols and other unrighteousness, through the name of Him who was crucified, Jesus Christ, and abide by their confession even unto death, and maintain piety. Moreover, by the works and by the attendant miracles, it is possible for all to understand that He is the new law, and the new covenant, and the expectation of those who out of every people wait for the good things of God. For the true spiritual Israel, and descendants of Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham (who in uncircumcision was approved of and blessed by God on account of his faith, and called the father of many nations), are we who have been led to God through this crucified Christ, as shall be demonstrated while we proceed.

Justin: I also adduced another passage in which Isaiah exclaims: "'Hear My words, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given Him for a witness to the people: nations which know not you shall call on You; peoples who know not you shall escape to you, because of your God, the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified You.'" This same law you have despised, and His new holy covenant you have slighted; and now you neither receive it, nor repent of your evil deeds. 'For your ears are closed, your eyes are blinded, and the heart is hardened,' Jeremiah has cried; yet not even then do you listen.

You have now need of a second circumcision, though you glory greatly in the flesh. The new law requires you to keep perpetual sabbath, and you, because you are idle for one day, suppose you are pious, not discerning why this has been commanded you: and if you eat unleavened bread, you say the will of God has been fulfilled. The Lord our God does not take pleasure in such observances: if there is any perjured person or a thief among you, let him cease to be so; if any adulterer, let him repent; then he has kept the sweet and true sabbaths of God.   location 6669

{Isa 52:10-12; Heb 10:4; Heb 10:14; Baptism; Jer 2:13; Jer 17:13; Acts 2:38}
Justin: "For Isaiah did not send you to a bath, there to wash away murder and other sins, which not even all the water of the sea were sufficient to purge; but, as might have been expected, this was that saving bath of the olden time which followed those who repented, and who no longer were purified by the blood of goats and of sheep, or by the ashes of an heifer, or by the offerings of fine flour, but by faith through the blood of Christ, and through His death, who died for this very reason, as Isaiah himself said, when he spoke thus: 'The Lord shall make bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the nations and the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of God. Depart you, depart you, depart you, go you out from thence, and touch no unclean thing; go you out of the midst of her, be you clean that bear the vessels of the Lord . . .  "By reason, therefore, of this laver of repentance and knowledge of God, which has been ordained on account of the transgression of God's people, as Isaiah cries, we have believed, and testify that that very baptism which he announced is alone able to purify those who have repented; and this is the water of life. But the cisterns which you have dug for yourselves are broken and profitless to you. For what is the use of that baptism which cleanses the flesh and body alone? Baptize the soul from wrath and from covetousness, from envy, and from hatred; and, lo! the body is pure.

For this is the symbolic significance of unleavened bread, that you do not commit the old deeds of wicked leaven. But you have understood all things in a carnal sense, and you suppose it to be piety if you do such things, while your souls are filled with deceit, and, in short, with every wickedness. Accordingly, also, after the seven days of eating unleavened bread, God commanded them to mingle new leaven, that is, the performance of other works, and not the imitation of the old and evil works.  location 6705

"Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart," as the words of God in all these passages demand. [Chap 16.] "And God himself proclaimed by Moses, speaking thus: 'And circumcise the hardness of your hearts, and no longer stiffen the neck. For the Lord your God is both Lord of lords, and a great, mighty, and terrible God, who regards not persons, and taketh not rewards.' And in Leviticus: 'Because they have transgressed against Me, and despised Me, and because they have walked contrary to Me, I also walked contrary to them, and I shall cut them off in the land of their enemies. Then shall their uncircumcised heart be turned." For the circumcision according to the flesh, which is from Abraham, was given for a sign; that you may be separated from other nations, and from us; and that you alone may suffer that which you now justly suffer; and that your land may be desolate, and your cities burned with fire; and that strangers may eat your fruit in your presence, and not one of you may go up to Jerusalem.'

[Justin, speaking to Jews]: and that your land may be desolate, and your cities burned with fire; and that strangers may eat your fruit in your presence, and not one of you may go up to Jerusalem.' For you are not recognized among the rest of men by any other mark than your fleshly circumcision. For none of you, I suppose, will venture to say that God neither did nor does foresee the events, which are future, nor foreordained his deserts for each one. Accordingly, these things have happened to you [Jews] in fairness and justice, for you have slain the Just One, and His prophets before Him; and now you reject those who hope in Him, and in Him who sent Him-God the Almighty and Maker of all things -cursing in your synagogues those that believe on Christ. For you have not the power to lay hands upon us, on account of those who now have the mastery. But as often as you could, you did so. Wherefore God, by Isaiah, calls to you, saying, "Behold how the righteous man perished, and no one regards it. For the righteous man is taken away from before iniquity. His grave shall be in peace, he is taken away from the midst. Draw near hither, you lawless children, seed of the adulterers, and children of the whore. Against whom have you sported yourselves, and against whom have you opened the mouth, and against whom have you loosened the tongue?" [Chap 17] For other nations have not inflicted on us and on Christ this wrong to such an extent as you have, who in very deed are the authors of the wicked prejudice against the Just One, and us who hold by Him. For after that you had crucified Him, the only blameless and righteous Man,- through whose stripes those who approach the Father by Him are healed, -when you knew that He had risen from the dead and ascended to heaven, as the prophets foretold He would, you not only did not repent of the wickedness which you had committed, but at that time you selected and sent out from Jerusalem chosen men through all the land to tell that the godless heresy of the Christians had sprung up, and to publish those things which all they who knew us not speak against us.

Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked! evil shall be rendered to him according to the works of his hands.' And again, in other words: 'Woe unto them that draw their iniquity as with a long cord, and their transgressions as with the harness of a heifer's yoke: who say, Let his speed come near; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it. Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put light for darkness, and darkness for light; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!' Accordingly, you displayed great zeal in publishing throughout all the land bitter and dark and unjust things against the only blameless and righteous Light sent by God. For He appeared distasteful to you when He cried among you, 'It is written, My house is the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves!' He overthrew also the tables of the money-changers in the temple, and exclaimed, 'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you pay tithe of mint and rue, but do not observe the love of God and justice.

Lot, being uncircumcised, was saved from Sodom, the angels themselves and the Lord sending him out. Noah was the beginning of our race; yet, uncircumcised, along with his children he went into the ark. Melchizedek, the priest of the Most High, was uncircumcised; to whom also Abraham the first who received circumcision after the flesh, gave tithes, and he blessed him: after whose order God declared, by the mouth of David, that He would establish the everlasting priest.

Justin: And as Trypho was ready to say, "as the green herbs," I anticipated him: "Why do you not receive this statement, 'as the green herbs,' in the sense in which it was given by God, to wit, that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to man, even so has He given the animals for the diet of flesh? But, you say, a distinction was laid down thereafter to Noah [regarding unclean meats], because we do not eat certain herbs. As you interpret it, the thing is incredible. And first I shall not occupy myself with this, though able to say and to hold that every vegetable is food, and fit to be eaten. But although we discriminate between green herbs, not eating all, we refrain from eating some, not because they are common or unclean, but because they are bitter, or deadly, or thorny. But we lay hands on and take of all herbs which are sweet, very nourishing and good, whether they are marine or land plants. 
[FN] Justin is saying: "As we abstain from some herbs, not because they are forbidden by law, but because they are deadly; so the law of abstinence from improper and violent animals was imposed not on Noah, but on you as a yoke on account of your sins."  location 6808

And that you may learn that it was for the sins of your own nation, and for their idolatries and not because there was any necessity for such sacrifices, that they were likewise enjoined, listen to the manner in which He speaks of these by Amos, one of the twelve, saying: "I hate, I reject your feast days. I do not savor your sacred assemblies. Though you offer me burnt offerings and meat offerings, I will not accept them. . .. O house of Israel, did you offer me sacrifices and offerings those forty years in the wilderness?" And again by Jeremiah: 'Collect your flesh, and sacrifices, and eat: for concerning neither sacrifices nor libations did I command your fathers in the day in which I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt.' And again by David, in the forty-ninth Psalm, He thus said: . . . "I will take no bullocks out of your house, nor he-goats out of your folds: for all the beasts of the field are Mine, the herds and the oxen on the mountains. I know all the fowls of the heavens, and the beauty of the field is Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows unto the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me." But unto the wicked God saith, What have you to do to declare My statutes, and to take My covenant into your mouth? But you have hated instruction, and cast My words behind you. . . . Now consider this, you that forget God, lest He tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. The sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me; and there is the way in which I shall show him My salvation."

Where is your zeal and strength? Where is the multitude of your mercy? for you have sustained us, O Lord. For you are our Father, because Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel has not recognized us.

But the Gentiles, who have believed on Him, and have repented of the sins which they have committed, they shall receive the inheritance along with the patriarchs and the prophets, and the just men who are descended from Jacob, even though they neither keep the Sabbath, nor are circumcised, nor observe the feasts. Assuredly they shall receive the holy inheritance of God. For God speaks by Isaiah thus: "I, the Lord God, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will strengthen You; and I have given you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house."   location 6916, 6919

{Sabbath; Isa 58:13; Isa 3:16; Ps 140:3; Eighth Day}
And Trypho said, "Why do you select and quote whatever you wish from the prophetic writings, but do not refer to those which expressly command the Sabbath to be observed? For Isaiah thus speaks: 'If you shall turn away your foot from the Sabbaths, so as not to do your pleasure on the holy day . . . then you shall trust in the Lord, and He shall cause you to go up to the good things of the land." . . .  And I replied, "I have passed them by, my friends, not because such prophecies were contrary to me, but because you have understood, and do understand, that although God commands you by all the prophets to do the same things which He also commanded by Moses, it was on account of the hardness of your hearts, and your ingratitude towards Him, that He continually proclaims them, in order that, even in this way, if you repented, you might please Him, and neither sacrifice your children to demons, nor be partakers with thieves, nor lovers of gifts, nor hunters after revenge, nor fail in doing judgment for orphans, nor be inattentive to the justice due to the widow nor have your hands full of blood. 'For the daughters of Zion have walked with a high neck, both sporting by winking with their eyes, and sweeping along their dresses. (Isa 3:16) "For they are all gone aside,' He exclaims, 'they are all become useless. There is none that understands, there is not so much as one. With their tongues they have practiced deceit, their throat is an open sepulcher, the poison of asps is under their lips, destruction and misery are in their paths, and the way of peace they have not known.' So that, as in the beginning, these things were enjoined you because of your wickedness, in like manner because of your steadfastness in it, or rather your increased proneness to it, by means of the same precepts He calls you to a remembrance or knowledge of it. But you are a people hard-hearted and without understanding, both blind and lame, children in whom is no faith, as He Himself says, honoring Him only with your lips, far from Him in your hearts, teaching doctrines that are your own and not His. For, tell me, did God wish the priests to sin when they offer the sacrifices on the Sabbaths? or those to sin, who are circumcised and do circumcise on the Sabbaths; since He commands that on the eighth day-even though it happen to be a Sabbath- those who are born shall be always circumcised? or could not the infants be operated upon one day previous or one day subsequent to the Sabbath, if He knew that it is a sinful act upon the Sabbaths? Or why did He not teach those-who are called righteous and pleasing to Him, who lived before Moses and Abraham, who were not circumcised in their foreskin, and observed no Sabbaths-to keep these institutions?"

Do not sow, therefore, among thorns, and in untilled ground, whence you can have no fruit. Know Christ; and behold the fallow ground, good, good and fat, is in your hearts.

For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in their hearts.' Do you see how that God does not mean this circumcision which is given for a sign? For it is of no use to the Egyptians, or the sons of Moab, or the sons of Edom. But though a man be a Scythian or a Persian, if he has the knowledge of God and of His Christ, and keeps the everlasting righteous decrees, he is circumcised with the good and useful circumcision, and is a friend of God, and God rejoices in his gifts and offerings. location 6963

"And," I continued, "I am not ignorant that you venture to expound this psalm as if it referred to king Hezekiah; but that you are mistaken, I shall prove to you from these very words forthwith.

Not even you will venture to object that Hezekiah was either a priest, or is the everlasting priest of God; but that this is spoken of our Jesus, these expressions show. But your ears are shut up, and your hearts are made dull. For by this statement, 'The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: you are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek,' with an oath God has shown Him (on account of your unbelief) to be the High Priest after the order of Melchizedek; i.e., as Melchizedek was described by Moses as the priest of the Most High, and he was a priest of those who were in uncircumcision, and blessed the circumcised Abraham who brought him tithes, so God has shown that His everlasting Priest, called also by the Holy Spirit Lord, would be Priest of those in uncircumcision.

Moreover, that Solomon was a renowned and great king, by whom the temple called that at Jerusalem was built, I know; but that none of those things mentioned in the Psalm happened to him, is evident. For neither did all kings worship him; nor did he reign to the ends of the earth; nor did his enemies, falling before him, lick the dust. Nay, also, I venture to repeat what is written in the book of Kings as committed by him, how through a woman's influence he worshipped the idols of Sidon, which those of the Gentiles who know God, the Maker of all things through Jesus the crucified, do not venture to do, but abide every torture and vengeance even to the extremity of death, rather than worship idols, or eat meat offered to idols.    location 7080

The Psalm of David is this: 'The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein. . . . Lift up your gates, you rulers; and be you lift up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. . . . Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.' Accordingly, it is shown that Solomon is not the Lord of hosts; but when our Christ rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, the rulers in heaven, under appointment of God, are commanded to open the gates of heaven, that He who is King of glory may enter in, and having ascended, may sit on the right hand of the Father until He make the enemies His footstool, as has been made manifest by another Psalm. For when the rulers of heaven saw Him of uncomely and dishonored appearance, and inglorious, not recognizing Him, they inquired, 'Who is this King of glory?' And the Holy Spirit, either from the person of His Father, or from His own person, answers them, 'The Lord of hosts, He is this King of glory.' Foreveryone will confess that not one of those who presided over the gates of the temple at Jerusalem would venture to say concerning Solomon, though he was so glorious a king, or concerning the ark of testimony, 'Who is this King of glory?'

"And the offering of fine flour, sirs," I said, "which was prescribed to be presented on behalf of those purified from leprosy, was a type of the bread of the Communion, the celebration of which our Lord Jesus Christ prescribed, in remembrance of the suffering which He endured on behalf of those who are purified in soul from all iniquity, in order that we may at the same time thank God for having created the world, with all things therein, for the sake of man, and for delivering us from the evil in which we were, and for utterly overthrowing principalities and powers by Him who suffered according to His will. Hence God speaks by the mouth of Malachi, one of the twelve [prophets], as I said before, about the sacrifices at that time presented by you: 'I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord; and I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands: for, from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, My name has been glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to My name, and a pure offering: for My name is great among the Gentiles, says the Lord: but you profane it.' [So] He then speaks of those Gentiles, namely us, who in every place offer sacrifices to Him, i.e., the bread of the Communion, and also the cup of the Communion, affirming both that we glorify His name, and that you profane [it].

{Lev 12:3; Eighth Day; Typology}
The command of circumcision, again, bidding [them] always circumcise the children on the eighth day, was a type of the true circumcision, by which we are circumcised from deceit and iniquity through Him who rose from the dead on the first day after the Sabbath, [namely through] our Lord Jesus Christ. For the first day after the Sabbath, remaining the first2061 of all the days, is called, however, the eighth, according to the number of all the days of the cycle, and [yet] remains the first.   location 7210, 7211

{Ex 28:28-29; Ps 19:4; Typology; Messianic Prophecies}
Moreover, the prescription that twelve bells be attached to the [robe] of the high priest, which hung down to the feet, was a symbol of the twelve apostles, who depend on the power of Christ, the eternal Priest; and through their voice it is that all the earth has been filled with the glory and grace of God and of His Christ. Wherefore David also says: 'Their sound has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.'  
[FN: Ex. 28 gives no definite number of bells. Otto presumes Justin to have confounded the bells and gems, which were twelve in number.]

{Isa 53:1-2; Typology; Messianic Prophecies}
And Isaiah speaks as if he were personating the apostles, when they say to Christ that they believe not in their own report, but in the power of Him who sent them. And so he says: "Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have preached before Him as if [He were] a child, as if a root in a dry ground."" But when the passage speaks as from the lips of many, 'We have preached before Him,' and adds, 'as if a child,' it signifies that the [formerly] wicked shall become subject to Him, and shall obey His command, and that all shall become as one child. Such a thing as you may witness in the body: although the members are enumerated as many, all are called one, and are a body. For, indeed, a commonwealth and a church, though  many individuals in number, are in fact as one, called and addressed by one appellation. "And in short, sirs," said I,
"by enumerating all the other appointments of Moses I can demonstrate that they were types, and symbols, and declarations of those things which would happen to Christ, of those who it was foreknown were to believe in Him, and of those things which would also be done by Christ Himself."

{Gen 17:9-14; Ex 20:8; Ex 20:24; Mt 5:17; Rom 10:4}
As, then, circumcision began with Abraham, and the Sabbath and sacrifices and offerings and feasts with Moses, and it has been proved they were enjoined on account of the hardness of your people's heart, so it was necessary, in accordance with the Father's will, that they should have an end in Him who was born of a virgin, of the family of Abraham and tribe of Judah, and of David; in Christ the Son of God, who was proclaimed as about to come to all the world, to be the everlasting Law and the everlasting Testament, even as the aforementioned prophecies show.   location 7232

{Isa 53:8}
But since the mystery of His birth now demands our attention I shall speak of it. Isaiah then asserted in regard to the generation of Christ, that it could not be declared by man, in words already quoted, "Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth: for the transgressions of my people was He led to death." The Spirit of prophecy thus affirmed that the generation of Him who was to die, that we sinful men might be healed by His stripes, was such as could not be declared.
Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, Ch.43

{Isa 7:14; Jews; Septuagint}
Furthermore, that the men who believe in Him may possess the knowledge of the manner in which He came into the world, the Spirit of prophecy by the same Isaiah foretold how it would happen thus: 'And the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying, Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your God, in the depth, or in the height. . . . Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and his name shall be called Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows or prefers the evil, and chooses out the good" . . .  Now it is evident to all, that in the race of Abraham according to the flesh no one has been born of a virgin, or is said to have been born [of a virgin], save this our Christ. But since you and your teachers venture to affirm that in the prophecy of Isaiah it is not said, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive,' but, 'Behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son;' and [since] you explain the prophecy as if [it referred] to Hezekiah, who was your king, I shall endeavor to discuss shortly this point in opposition to you, and to show that reference is made to Him who is acknowledged by us as Christ. location 7251

Justin: And you deceive yourselves while you fancy that, because you are the seed of Abraham after the flesh, therefore you shall fully inherit the good things announced to be bestowed by God through Christ. For no one, not even of them, has anything to look for, but only those who in mind are assimilated to the faith of Abraham, and who have recognized all the mysteries. . . . So that it becomes you to eradicate this hope from your souls, and hasten to know in what way forgiveness of sins, and a hope of inheriting the promised good things, shall be yours.

{Ezek 14:12-20; Rom 7:6-7; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 4:9; Circumcision; Jews; Salvation} 
Then Trypho [a Jew] said, "Tell me, then, shall those who lived according to the Law given by Moses, live in the same manner with Jacob, Enoch, and Noah, in the resurrection of the dead, or not?"   
I [Justin] replied to him, "When I quoted, sir, the words spoken by Ezekiel, that even if Noah and Daniel and Jacob were to beg sons and daughters, the request would not be granted them," but that each one, that is to say, shall be saved by his own righteousness, I said also, that those who regulated their lives by the law of Moses would in like manner be saved. For what in the Law of Moses is naturally good, and pious, and righteous, and has been prescribed to be done by those who obey it; and what was appointed to be performed by reason of the hardness of the people's hearts; was similarly recorded, and done also by those who were under the law. Since those who did that which is universally, naturally, and eternally good are pleasing to God, they shall be saved through this Christ in the resurrection equally with those righteous men who were before them, namely Noah, and Enoch, and Jacob, and whoever else there be, along with those who have known this Christ, Son of God.  location 7279

This Christ, Son of God, who was before the morning star and the moon, and submitted to become incarnate, and be born of this virgin of the family of David, in order that, by this dispensation, the serpent that sinned from the beginning, and the angels like him, may be destroyed, and that death may be contemned, and forever quit, at the second coming of the Christ Himself, those who believe in Him and live acceptably,-and be no more: when some are sent to be punished unceasingly into judgment and condemnation of fire; but others shall exist in freedom from suffering, from corruption, and from grief, and in immortality.

{Acts 21:20-21; Jews}
[Trypho:] But if some, even now, wish to live in the observance of the institutions given by Moses, and yet believe in this Jesus who was crucified, recognizing Him to be the Christ of God, and that it is given to Him to be absolute Judge of all, and that His is the everlasting kingdom, can they also be saved?" he inquired of me. And I replied, "Let us consider that also together, whether one may now observe all the Mosaic institutions." And he answered,
"No. For we know that, as you said, it is not possible either anywhere to sacrifice the lamb of the Passover, or to offer the goats ordered for the fast; or, in short, [to present] all the other offerings." And I said, "Tell [me] then yourself, I pray, some things which can be observed; for you will be persuaded that, though a man does not keep or has not performed the eternal decrees, he may assuredly be saved." Then he replied, "To keep the Sabbath, to be circumcised, to observe months, and to be washed if you touch anything prohibited by Moses, or after sexual intercourse.". . . And I said, "Do you think that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, and Job, and all the rest before or after them equally righteous, also Sarah the wife of Abraham, Rebekah the wife of Isaac, Rachel the wife of Jacob, and Leah, and all the rest of them, until the mother of Moses the faithful servant, who observed none of these [statutes], will be saved?"   location 7295, 7297

{Num 15:38-40; Deut.6:6}
Then I returned answer, "You perceive that God by Moses laid all such ordinances upon you on account of the hardness of your people's hearts, in order that, by the large number of them, you might keep God continually, and in every action, before your eyes, and never begin to act unjustly or impiously. For He enjoined you to place around you [a fringe] of purple dye, in order that you might not forget God; and He commanded you to wear a phylactery, certain characters, which indeed we consider holy, being engraved on very thin parchment; and by these means stirring you up to retain a constant remembrance of God:   location 7305

And Trypho again inquired, "But if someone, knowing that this is so, after he recognizes that this man is Christ, and has believed in and obeys Him, wishes, however, to observe these [institutions], will he be saved?" . . . I said, "In my opinion, Trypho, such a one will be saved, if he does not strive in every way to persuade other men,-I mean those Gentiles who have been circumcised from error by Christ, to observe the same things as himself, telling them that they will not be saved unless they do so. This you did yourself at the commencement of the discourse, when you declared that I would not be saved unless I observe these institutions. . . . Then Trypho replied, ""Why then have you said, 'In my opinion, such a person will be saved,' --unless [that means] there are some who affirm that such will not be saved?"
"There are such people, Trypho," I answered; "And these do not venture to have any intercourse with or to extend hospitality to such [Jewish] persons; but I do not agree with them. But if some [converted Jews], through weak-mindedness, wish to observe such institutions as were given by Moses, from which they expect some virtue, but which we believe were appointed by reason of the hardness of the people's hearts, along with their hope in this Christ, and [wish to perform] the eternal and natural acts of righteousness and piety, yet choose to live with the Christians and the faithful, as I said before, not inducing them either to be circumcised like themselves, or to keep the Sabbath, or to observe any other such ceremonies, then I hold that we ought to join ourselves to such, and associate with them in all things as kinsmen and brethren.

For the goodness and the loving-kindness of God, and His boundless riches, hold righteous and sinless the man who, as Ezekiel tells, repents of sins; and reckons sinful, unrighteous, and impious the man who falls away from piety and righteousness to unrighteousness and ungodliness. Wherefore also our Lord Jesus Christ said, 'In whatsoever things I shall take you, in these I shall judge you.'

{Jn 1:1; Deity of Christ}
[Trypho:] when you say that this Christ existed as God before the ages, then that He submitted to be born and become man, yet that He is not man of man, this [assertion] appears to me to be not merely paradoxical, but also foolish." . . .

And Trypho said, "Those [Ebionites] who affirm him to have been a man, and to have been anointed by election, and then to have become Christ, appear to me to speak more plausibly than you who hold those opinions which you express. For we all expect that Christ will be a man [born] of men, and that Elijah when he comes will anoint him. But if this man appear to be Christ, he must be known as man [born] of men; but from the circumstance that Elijah has not yet come, I infer that this man is not He [the Christ]."

{Mal 4:5; Rev 11:3-6}
Then I inquired of him, "Does not Scripture, in the book of Zechariah [Malachi], say that Elijah shall come before the great and terrible day of the Lord?" And Trypho answered,
"Certainly." "If therefore Scripture compels you to admit that two advents of Christ were predicted to take place,-one in which He would appear suffering, and dishonored, and without comeliness; but the other in which He would come glorious and Judge of all, . . . shall we not suppose that the word of God has proclaimed that Elijah shall be the precursor of the great and terrible day, that is, of His second advent?"   location 7361, 7363
Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, Ch.49

{Mal 4:5; Mt 17:10-12; Num 11:17; Deut 34:9}
Our Lord in His teaching," I continued, "proclaimed that this very thing would take place, saying that Elijah would also come. And we know that this shall take place when our Lord Jesus Christ shall come in glory from heaven; whose first manifestation the Spirit of God who was in Elijah preceded as herald in [the person of] John, a prophet among your nation; after whom no other prophet appeared among you. He cried, as he sat by the river Jordan: 'I baptize you with water to repentance; but He that is stronger than I shall come, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire . . .  Wherefore also our Christ said, [when He was] on earth, to those who were affirming that Elijah must come before Christ: 'Elijah shall come, and restore all things; but I say unto you, that Elijah has already come, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatsoever they chose.' And it is written, 'Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist.'
"And Trypho said, "This statement also seems to me paradoxical; namely, that the prophetic Spirit of God, who was in Elijah, was also in John." To this I replied,
"Do you not think that the same thing happened in the case of Joshua the son of Nave (Nun), who succeeded to the command of the people after Moses, when Moses was 
 commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, 'I will take of the spirit which is in you, and put it on him?' . . . "As therefore," I say, "while Moses was still among men, God took of the spirit which was in Moses and put it on Joshua, even so God was able to cause [the spirit] of Elijah to come upon John; in order that, as Christ at His first coming appeared inglorious, even so the first coming of the spirit, which remained always pure in Elijah like that of Christ, might be perceived to be inglorious. 
Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, Ch.49
{1 Pet 3:15}
And Trypho said [to Justin], "You seem to me to have come out of a great conflict with many persons about all the points we have been searching into, and therefore quite ready to return answers to all questions put to you."

{Isa 40:3-6; Mt 11:13-14; Jews; Messianic Prophecies; Prophecies of Jesus}
Isaiah thus foretold John's forerunning: . . . "Encourage the people; you priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and encourage her, because her humiliation is accomplished. Her sin is annulled; for she has received of the Lord's hand double for her sins. A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the ways of the Lord; make straight the paths of our God. . . .
And when I ceased, Trypho said, "All the words of the prophecy you repeat, sir, are ambiguous, and have no force in proving what you wish to prove." Then I answered,
"If the prophets had not ceased, so that there were no more in your nation, Trypho, after this John, it is evident that what I say in reference to Jesus Christ might be regarded perhaps as ambiguous. But if John came first calling on men to repent, and Christ, while [John] still sat by the river Jordan, having come, put an end to his prophesying and baptizing, and preached also Himself, saying that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, . . . Moreover, He referred to the fact that there would be no longer in your nation any prophet, and to the fact that men recognized how that the New Testament, which God formerly announced [His intention of] promulgating, was then present, i.e., Christ Himself; and in the following terms: 'The law and the prophets were until John the Baptist; from that time the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. And if you can receive it, he is Elijah, who was to come."    location 7418

{Jews; Apocrypha; Mt 23:38; Mt 11:13; Lk 16:16; Gen 49:8-10; Lk 21:20-24; Messianic Prophecies}
And it was prophesied by Jacob the patriarch that there would be two advents of Christ, and that in the first He would suffer, and that after He came there would be neither prophet nor king in your nation (I proceeded), and that the nations who believed in the suffering Christ would look for His future appearance. And for this reason the Holy Spirit had uttered these truths in a parable, and obscurely: for, I added, it is said, "Judah, your brethren have praised you: your hands [shall be] on the neck of your enemies; the sons of your father shall worship you. . . . A ruler shall not depart from Judah, or a leader from his thighs, until that which is laid up in store for him shall come; and he shall be the desire of nations. . ." Moreover, that in your nation there never failed either prophet or ruler, from the time when they began until the time when this Jesus Christ appeared and suffered, you will not venture shamelessly to assert, nor can you prove it. For though you affirm that Herod, after whose [reign] He suffered, was an Ashkelonite [actually Idumean] nevertheless you admit that there was a high priest in your nation; so that you then had one who presented offerings according to the law of Moses, and observed the other legal ceremonies; also [you had] prophets in succession until John, (even then, too, when your nation was carried captive to Babylon, when your land was ravaged by war, and the sacred vessels carried off); there never failed to be a prophet among you, who was lord, and leader, and ruler of your nation. For the Spirit which was in the prophets anointed your kings, and established them. But after the manifestation and death of our Jesus Christ in your nation, there was and is nowhere any prophet: nay, further, you ceased to exist under your own king, your land was laid waste, and forsaken like a lodge in a vineyard; and the statement of Scripture, in the mouth of Jacob, 'And He shall be the desire of nations,' meant symbolically His two advents, and that the nations would believe in Him; which facts you may now at length discern location 7436

{Gen 49:11; Messianic Prophecies}
"And that expression, 'binding his foal to the vine, and the ass's foal to the vine tendril,' was a declaring beforehand both of the works wrought by Him at His first advent, and also of that belief in Him which the nations would repose. For they were like an unharnessed foal, which was not bearing a yoke on its neck, until this Christ came, and sent His disciples to instruct them; and they bore the yoke of His word, and yielded the neck to endure all [hardships], for the sake of the good things promised by Himself, and expected by them. location 7454
Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, Ch.53

{Zech 9:9; Mt 21:1-6; Gen 49:11; Messianic Prophecies}
And truly our Lord Jesus Christ, when He intended to go into Jerusalem, requested His disciples to bring Him a certain ass, along with its foal, which was bound in an entrance of a village called Bethphage; and having seated Himself on it, He entered into Jerusalem. And as this was done by Him in the manner in which it was prophesied in precise terms that it would be done by the Christ, and as the fulfilment was recognized, it became a clear proof that He was the Christ. And though all this happened and is proved from Scripture, you are still hard-hearted. Nay, it was prophesied by Zechariah, one of the twelve [prophets], that such would take place, in the following words: 'Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, and declare, daughter of Jerusalem; behold, your King shall come to you, righteous, bringing salvation, meek, and lowly, riding on an ass, and the foal of an ass." Now, that the Spirit of prophecy, as well as the patriarch Jacob [Gen 49:11], mentioned both an ass and its foal, which would be used by Him; and, further, that He, as I previously said, requested His disciples to bring both beasts; [this fact] was a prediction that you of the synagogue, along with the Gentiles, would believe in Him. For as the unharnessed colt was a symbol of the Gentiles even so the harnessed ass was a symbol of your nation. For you possess the law which was imposed [upon you] by the prophets.

Moreover, the prophet Zechariah foretold that this same Christ would be smitten, and His disciples scattered: which also took place. For after His crucifixion, the disciples that accompanied Him were dispersed, until He rose from the dead, and persuaded them that so it had been prophesied concerning Him, that He would suffer; and being thus persuaded, they went into all the world, and taught these truths. Hence also we are strong in His faith and doctrine, since we have [this our] persuasion both from the prophets, and from those who throughout the world are seen to be worshippers of God in the name of that crucified One. The following is said, too, by Zechariah: 'O sword, rise up against My Shepherd, and against the man of My people, says the Lord of hosts. Smite the Shepherd, and His flock shall be scattered."

{Gen 49:11; Mt 1:18; Lk 1:35; Rev 5:9-10; Preface to Genesis; Messianic Prophecies}
Justin: And that expression which was committed to writing by Moses, and prophesied by the patriarch Jacob, namely, "He shall wash His garments with wine, and His vesture with the blood of the grape," signified that He would wash those that believe in Him with His own blood. (Rev 5:9-10) For the Holy Spirit called those who receive remission of sins through Him, His garments; among whom He is always present in power, but will be manifestly present at His second coming. That the Scripture mentions the blood of the grape has been evidently designed, because Christ derives blood not from the seed of man, but from the power of God. For as God, and not man, has produced the blood of the vine, so also [the Scripture] has predicted that the blood of Christ would be not of the seed of man, but of the power of God.    location 7463

{Deut 4:19; 1 Cor 8:5-6; Jews; Deity of Christ}
[Trypho the Jew:] Show us that the Spirit of prophecy admits another God besides the Maker of all things, taking care not to speak of the sun and moon, which, it is written, God has given to the nations to worship as gods; and oftentimes the prophets, employing this manner of speech, say that "thy God is a God of gods, and a Lord of lords,' adding frequently, 'the great and strong and terrible [God]." For such expressions are used, not as if they really were gods, but because the Scripture is teaching us that the true God, who made all things, is Lord alone of those who are reputed gods and lords.

Justin: I would not bring forward these [invalid] proofs, Trypho, . . . but such [proofs] as no one could find any objection to. They will appear strange to you, although you read them every day; so that even from this fact we understand that, because of your wickedness, God has withheld from you the ability to discern the wisdom of His Scriptures; yet [there are] some exceptions, to whom, according to the grace of His long-suffering, as Isaiah said, "He has left a seed of salvation, lest your race be utterly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrah."  location 7477

Moses, then, the blessed and faithful servant of God, declares that He who appeared to Abraham under the oak in Mamre is God, sent with the two angels in His company to judge Sodom by Another who remains ever in the supercelestial places, invisible to all men, holding personal intercourse with none, whom we believe to be Maker and Father of all things; for he speaks thus: "God appeared to him under the oak in Mamre, as he sat at his tent-door at noontide. And lifting up his eyes, he saw, and behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent; and he bowed himself toward the ground."  location 7484

 "Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord: and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward the adjacent country, and beheld, and, lo, a flame went up from the earth, like the smoke of a furnace." . . . [Justin]: I shall attempt to persuade you [Trypho], since you have understood the Scriptures, [of the truth] of what I say, that there is, and that there is said to be, another God and Lord subject to the Maker of all things; who is also called an Angel, because He announces to men whatsoever the Maker of all things-above whom there is no other God-wishes to announce to them.

{Gen 23:10; Gen 26:9-12; Deity of Christ}
But God appeared to him, before the vision of the three. Then those three whom the Scripture calls men, were angels; two of them sent to destroy Sodom, and one to announce the joyful tidings to Sarah, that she would bear a son; for which cause he was sent, and having accomplished his errand, went away. How then, said I, does the one of the three, who was in the tent, and who said, 'I shall return to you hereafter, and Sarah shall have a son,' appear to have returned when Sarah had begotten a son, and to be there declared, by the prophetic word, God? But that you may clearly discern what I say, listen to the words expressly employed by Moses; they are these: "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian bond-woman, whom she bore to Abraham, sporting with Isaac her son, and said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman and her son; . . . But God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the son, . . .." Have you perceived, then, that He who said under the oak that He would return, since He knew it would be necessary to advise Abraham to do what Sarah wished him, came back as it is written; and is God, as the words declare, when they so speak: 'God said to Abraham."

And when he came [to Sodom], the two angels no longer conversed with Lot, but Himself, as the Scripture makes evident; and He is the Lord who received commission from the Lord who [remains] in the heavens, i.e., the Maker of all things, to inflict upon Sodom and Gomorrah the [judgments] which the Scripture describes in these terms: 'The Lord rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven.'   location 7558

I answered, "It is written that they ate; and if we hear that it is said the three ate, and not the two alone-who were really angels, and are nourished in the heavens, as is evident to us, even though they are not nourished by food similar to that which mortals use-(for, concerning the sustenance of manna which supported your fathers in the desert, Scripture speaks thus, that they ate angels' food) [Ps 78:25 LXX] Then I would say that the Scripture which affirms they ate bears the same meaning as when we would say about fire that it has devoured all things; yet it is not certainly understood that they ate, masticating with teeth and jaws.

The word of God, therefore, [recorded] by Moses, when referring to Jacob the grandson of Abraham, speaks thus: 'And it came to pass, when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun color.

I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who wrestled in human form with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are as follows: 'And Jacob went out from the well of the oath, and went toward Charran. And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place, and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it.

For the Scripture says thus: 'The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the bush. . . . The Scripture, in announcing that the Angel of the Lord appeared to Moses, and in afterwards declaring him to be Lord and God, speaks of the same One, whom it declares by the many testimonies already quoted to be minister to God, who is above the world, above whom there is no other [God].         location 7641

{Prov 8:22-25; Jn 1:1; Son, Begetting of; Jn 1:14; Josh 5:13-15}
God begot before all creatures a Beginning, [who was] a certain rational power [proceeding] from Himself, who is called by the Holy Spirit, now the Glory of the Lord, now the Son, again Wisdom, again an Angel, then God, and then Lord and Logos; and on another occasion He calls Himself Captain, when He appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave (Nun). For He can be called by all those names, since He ministers to the Father's will, and since He was begotten of the Father by an act of will; just as we see happening among ourselves: for when we give out some word, we beget the word; yet not by abscission, so as to lessen the word [which remains] in us, when we give it out: and just as we see also happening in the case of a fire, which is not lessened when it has kindled [another], but remains the same; and that which has been kindled by it likewise appears to exist by itself, not diminishing that from which it was kindled. The Word of Wisdom, who is Himself this God begotten of the Father of all things, and Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and the Glory of the Begetter, will bear evidence to me, when He speaks by Solomon the following: 'If I shall declare to you what happens daily, I shall call to mind events from everlasting, and review  them. The Lord made me the beginning of His ways for His works. From everlasting He established me in the beginning, before He had made the earth, and before He had made the deeps, before the springs of the waters had issued forth, before the mountains had been established. Before all the hills He begets me." location 7665
[FN: The word, logos, translated "word," means both the thinking power or reason which produces ideas and the expression of these ideas. And Justin passes here from the one meaning to the other. When we utter a thought, the utterance of it does not diminish the power of thought in us, though in one sense the thought has gone away from us.

God speaks in the creation of man with the very same design, in the following words: "Let Us make man after our image and likeness. . . . And God created man: after the image of God did He create him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and have power over it." And that you may not change the [force of the] words just quoted, and repeat what your [Jewish] teachers assert,-either that God said to Himself, 'Let Us make,' just as we, when about to do something, oftentimes say to ourselves, 'Let us make;' or that God spoke to the elements, to wit, the earth and other similar substances of which we believe man was formed, 'Let Us make,'-I shall quote again the words narrated by Moses himself, from which we can indisputably learn that [God] conversed with someone who was numerically distinct from Himself, and also a rational Being. These are the words: "And God said, Behold, Adam has become as one of us, to know good and evil." In saying, therefore, "as one of us," [Moses] has declared that [there is a certain] number of persons associated with one another, and that they are at least two. For I would not say that the dogma of that heresy which is said to be among you [Jews] is true, or that the teachers of it can prove that [God] spoke to angels, or that the human frame was the workmanship of angels. But this Offspring, which was truly brought forth from the Father, was with the Father before all the creatures, and the Father communed with Him; even as the Scripture by Solomon has made clear, that He whom Solomon calls Wisdom, was begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures and as Offspring by God     location 7682

The passage, then, which Isaiah records, "Who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken away from the earth,"-does it not appear to you to refer to One who, not having descent from men, was said to be delivered over to death by God for the transgressions of the people?-of whose blood, Moses (as I mentioned before), when speaking in parable, said, that He would wash His garments in the blood of the grape; since His blood did not spring from the seed of man, but from the will of God. And then, what is said by David, 'In the splendors of your holiness have I begotten you from the womb, before the morning star. The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, you are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek,'-does this not declare to you that [He was] from of old, and that the God and Father of all things intended Him to be begotten by a human womb? And speaking in other words, which also have been already quoted, [he says]: "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: a scepter of rectitude is the scepter of your kingdom. . . . Hearken, O daughter, and behold, and incline your ear, and forget your people and the house of your father; and the King shall desire your beauty: because he is your Lord, and you shall worship Him."

[Justin:] But I shall remind you of what the passage says, in order that you may recognize even from this very [place] that God gives glory to His Christ alone.  . . . "[The words] are these: 'Thus says the Lord, the God that created the heavens, and made2196 them fast, that established the earth, and that which is in it; and gave breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them who walk therein: I the Lord God have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will strengthen You; and I have given you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out them that are bound from the chains, and those who sit in darkness from the prison-house. I am the Lord God; this is my name: my glory will I not give to another, nor my virtues to graven images." . ..

And Trypho answered, "The Scripture has not, 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,' but, 'Behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son,' and so on, as you quoted. But the whole prophecy refers to Hezekiah, and it is proved that it was fulfilled in him, according to the terms of this prophecy. Moreover, in the fables of those who are called Greeks, it is written that Perseus was begotten of Danae, who was a virgin; he who was called among them Zeus having descended on her in the form of a golden shower. And you ought to feel ashamed when you make assertions similar to theirs, and rather [should] say that this Jesus was born man of men. And if you prove from the Scriptures that He is the Christ, and that on account of having led a life conformed to the law, and perfect, He deserved the honor of being elected to be Christ, [it is well]; but do not venture to tell monstrous phenomena, lest you be convicted of talking foolishly like the Greeks."    location 7786

It is thus written: 'Rejoice, thirsty wilderness: let the wilderness be glad, and blossom as the lily. . . For water has broken forth in the wilderness, and a valley in the thirsty land; and the parched ground shall become pools, and a spring of water shall [rise up] in the thirsty land."

And I wish you to observe, that they have altogether taken away many Scriptures from the translations effected by those seventy elders who were with Ptolemy, and by which this very man who was crucified is proved to have been set forth expressly as God, and man, and as being crucified, and as dying; but since I am aware that this is denied by all of your nation, I do not address myself to these points, but I proceed to carry on my discussions by means of those passages which are still admitted by you. For you [Trypho] assent to those which I have brought before your attention, except that you contradict the statement, "Behold, the virgin shall conceive,"   location 7909

{Jews; Septuagint; Jer 11:19}
[Jews]: "We ask you first of all to tell us some of the Scriptures which you allege have been completely cancelled." [Ch 72] And I said, "I shall do as you please. From the statements, then, which Esdras made in reference to the Law of the Passover, they have taken away the following: "And Esdras said to the people, This Passover is our Savior and our refuge. And if you have understood, and your heart has taken it in, that we shall humble Him on a standard, and thereafter hope in Him, then this place shall not be forsaken forever, says the God of hosts. . . . "But if you will not believe Him, and will not listen to His declaration, you shall be a laughing-stock to the nations." [unknown passage from Esdras]  And from the sayings of Jeremiah they have cut out the following: "I [was] like a lamb that is brought to the slaughter: they devised a device against me, saying, Come, let us lay on wood on His bread, and let us blot Him out from the land of the living; and His name shall no more be remembered." And since this passage from the sayings of Jeremiah is still written in some copies [of the Scriptures] in the synagogues of the Jews (for it is only a short time since they were cut out), and since from these words it is demonstrated that the Jews deliberated about the Christ Himself, to crucify and put Him to death, He Himself is both declared to be led as a sheep to the slaughter, as was predicted by Isaiah, and is here represented as a harmless lamb; but being in a difficulty about them, they give themselves over to blasphemy. And again, from the sayings of the same Jeremiah these have been cut out: "The Lord God remembered His dead people of Israel who lay in the graves; and He descended to preach to them His own salvation."

Now no one of your people has ever been said to have reigned as God and Lord among the nations, with the exception of Him only who was crucified.

{Ex 23:20-21; Num 13:16; Hos 11:1}
Moreover, in the book of Exodus we have also perceived that the name of God Himself which, He says, was not revealed to Abraham or to Jacob, was Jesus, and was declared mysteriously through Moses. Thus it is written: 'And the Lord spoke to Moses, Say to this people, Behold, I send My angel before your face, to keep you in the way, to bring you into the land which I have prepared for you. Give heed to Him, and obey Him; do not disobey Him. For He will not draw back from you; for My name is in Him.' Now understand that He who led your fathers into the land is called by this name Jesus, and first called Auses (Oshea). For if you shall understand this, you shall likewise perceive that the name of Him who said to Moses, 'for My name is in Him,' was Jesus. For, indeed, He was also called Israel, and Jacob's name was changed to this also. (Hos 11:1)     location 7966

For when Daniel speaks of 'one like unto the Son of man' who received the everlasting kingdom, does he not hint at this very thing? For he declares that, in saying 'like unto the Son of man,' He appeared, and was man, but not of human seed. And the same thing he proclaimed in mystery when he speaks of this stone which was cut out without hands. For the expression 'it was cut out without hands' signified that it is not a work of man, but [a work] of the will of the Father and God of all things, who brought Him forth. And when Isaiah says, 'Who shall declare His generation?' he meant that His descent could not be declared. Now no one who is a man of men has a descent that cannot be declared.

And when Isaiah calls Him "the Angel of mighty counsel," (Isa 9:6 LXX) did he not foretell Him to be the Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He came [to earth]? For He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the Father designed both for all those who have been and shall be well-pleasing to Him, and also for those who have rebelled against His will, whether men or angels, when He said: 'They shall come from the east [and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.' And, 'Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not eaten, and drunk, and prophesied, and cast out demons in your name? And I will say to them, Depart from Me.' Again, in other words, by which He shall condemn those who are unworthy of salvation, He said, 'Depart into outer darkness, which the Father has prepared for Satan and his, angels.'

[Trypho:] Proceed then to make this plain to us, that we may see how you prove that that [passage] refers to this Christ of yours. For we assert that the prophecy relates to Hezekiah." And I replied, "I shall do as you wish. But show me yourselves first of all how it is said of Hezekiah, that 'before he knew how to call father or mother, he received the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria in the presence of the king of Assyria.' (Isa 8:4 LXX) For it will not be conceded to you, as you wish to explain it, that Hezekiah waged war with the inhabitants of Damascus and Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria. 'For before the child knows how to call father or mother,' the prophetic word said, 'He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria in presence of the king of Assyria.' For if the Spirit of prophecy had not made the statement with an addition, 'Before the child knows how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,' but had only said, 'And shall bear a son, and he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria,' then you might say that God foretold that he would take these things, since He foreknew it. But now the prophecy has stated it with this addition: 'Before the child knows how to call father or mother, he shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria.' And you cannot prove that such a thing ever happened to anyone among the Jews. But we are able to prove that it happened in the case of our Christ. For at the time of His birth, Magi who came from Arabia worshipped Him, coming first to Herod, who then was sovereign in your land, and whom the Scripture calls king of Assyria on account of his ungodly and sinful character. For you know," continued I, "that the Holy Spirit oftentimes announces such events by parables and similitudes; just as He did towards all the people in Jerusalem, frequently saying to them, 'Thy father is an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite."    location 8004

On the occasion of the first census which was taken in Judaea, under Cyrenius, he [Joseph] went up from Nazareth, where he lived, to Bethlehem, to which he belonged, to be enrolled; for his family was of the tribe of Judah, which then inhabited that region. . . . But when the Child was born in Bethlehem, since Joseph could not find a lodging in that village, he took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed Him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found Him. I have repeated to you," I continued, "what Isaiah foretold about the sign which foreshadowed the cave." (Isa 33:16 LXX)   location 8022

As he [Herod] did not know the Child whom the Magi had gone to worship, ordered simply the whole of the children then in Bethlehem to be massacred. And Jeremiah prophesied that this would happen, speaking by the Holy Ghost thus: "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and much wailing, Rachel weeping for her children; and she would not be comforted, because they are not." Therefore, on account of the voice which would be heard from Ramah, i.e., from Arabia (for there is in Arabia at this very time a place called Rama), wailing would come on the place where Rachel the wife of Jacob called Israel, the holy patriarch, has been buried, i.e., on Bethlehem; while the women weep for their own slaughtered children, and have no consolation by reason of what has happened to them.

{Isa 8:4; Mt 2:1-2; Mt 2:9-11; Mt 15:21-28}
For that expression of Isaiah, "He shall take the power of Damascus and spoils of Samaria," foretold that the power of the evil demon that dwelt in Damascus should be overcome by Christ as soon as He was born; and this is proved to have happened. For the Magi, who were held in bondage for the commission of all evil deeds through the power of that demon, by coming to worship Christ, shows that they have revolted from that dominion which held them captive; and this [dominion] the Scripture has showed us to reside in Damascus. Moreover, that sinful and unjust power is termed well in parable, Samaria. And none of you can deny that Damascus was, and is, in the region of Arabia, although now it belongs to what is called Syro-Phoenicia.   location 8038

Therefore also this grace [favor] has been transferred to us, as Isaiah says, speaking to the following effect: "This people draws near to Me, they honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me; but in vain they worship Me, teaching the commands and doctrines of men.

On this, Trypho, who was somewhat angry, but respected the Scriptures, as was manifest from his countenance, said to me, "The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God." . . . But that you may know, sir," continued I [Justin], "that it is not our audacity which has induced us to adopt this exposition, which you reprehend, I shall give you evidence from Isaiah himself; for he affirms that evil angels have dwelt and do dwell in Tanis, in Egypt. These are [his] words: 'Woe to the rebellious children! ... For the shadow of Pharaoh shall be a disgrace to you, and a reproach to those who trust in the Egyptians; for the princes in Tanis are evil angels. In vain will they labor for a people which will not profit them by assistance, but [will be] for a disgrace and a reproach [to them]." And, further, Zechariah tells, as you yourself have related, that the devil stood on the right hand of Joshua the priest, to resist him; and [the Lord] said, "The Lord, who has taken Jerusalem, rebuke you." And again, it is written in Job, as you said yourself, how that the angels came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came with them.

For He said we would be put to death, and hated for His name's sake; and that many false prophets and false Christs would appear in His name, and deceive many: and so has it come about. For many have taught godless, blasphemous, and unholy doctrines, forging them in His name; have taught, too, and even yet are teaching, those things which proceed from the unclean spirit of the devil, and which were put into their hearts.

"For your teachers have ventured to refer the passage, "The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool," to Hezekiah; as if he were requested to sit on the right side of the temple, when the king of Assyria sent to him and threatened him; and he was told by Isaiah not to be afraid. Now we know and admit that what Isaiah said took place; that the king of Assyria desisted from waging war against Jerusalem in Hezekiah's days, and the angel of the Lord slew about 185,000 of the host of the Assyrians. But it is manifest that the Psalm does not refer to him. For thus it is written, "The Lord says to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool. He shall send forth a rod of power over Jerusalem, and it shall rule in the midst of your enemies. In the splendor of the saints before the morning star have I begotten You. The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, you are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek." Who does not admit, then, that Hezekiah is no priest forever after the order of Melchizedek? And who does not know that he is not the redeemer of Jerusalem? And who does not know that he neither sent a rod of power into Jerusalem, nor ruled in the midst of his enemies; but that it was God who averted from him the enemies, after he mourned and was afflicted?

For if He to whom Isaiah referred was not to be begotten of a virgin, of whom did the Holy Spirit declare, "Behold, the Lord Himself shall give us a sign: behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son?" For if He also were to be begotten of sexual intercourse, like all other first-born sons, why did God say that He would give a sign which is not common to all the first-born sons? But that which is truly a sign, and which was to be made trustworthy to mankind,-namely, that the first-begotten of all creation should become incarnate by the virgin's womb, and be a child,-this he anticipated by the Spirit of prophecy, and predicted it, as I have repeated to you, in various ways; in order that, when the event should take place, it might be known as the operation of the power and will of the Maker of all things; just as Eve was made from one of Adam's ribs, and as all living beings were created in the beginning by the Word of God. But you in these matters venture to pervert the expositions which your elders that were with Ptolemy king of Egypt gave forth, since you assert that the Scripture is not so as they have expounded it, but says, "Behold, the young woman shall conceive," as if great events were to be inferred if a woman should beget from sexual intercourse: which indeed all young women, with the exception of the barren, do.  location 8137

The people found seventy willows and twelve springs after crossing the Jordan [actually, the Red Sea]. David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff.

(Isa 11:1] Elisha, by casting a stick into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe with which the sons of the prophets had gone to cut down trees to build the house in which they wished to read and study the law and commandments of God; even as our Christ, by being crucified on the tree, and by purifying [us] with water, has redeemed us, though plunged in the direst offences which we have committed, and has made [us] a house of prayer and adoration.

[Trypho:] . . . and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety: and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him." Now you admitted to me," continued he [Trypho], "that this referred to Christ, and you maintain Him to be pre-existent God, and having become incarnate by God's will, to be born man by the virgin. How He can be demonstrated to have been pre-existent, who is filled with the powers of the Holy Ghost, which the Scripture by Isaiah enumerates, as if He were in lack of them?" 
Then I [Justin] replied, "You have inquired most discreetly and most prudently, for truly there does seem to be a difficulty; but listen to what I say, that you may perceive the reason of this also. The Scripture says that these enumerated powers of the Spirit have come on Him, not because He stood in need of them, but because they would rest in Him, i.e., would find their accomplishment in Him, so that there would be no more prophets in your nation after the ancient custom: and this fact you plainly perceive. For after Him no prophet has arisen among you. Now, that [you may know that] your prophets, each receiving someone or two powers from God, did and spoke the things which we have learned from the Scriptures, attend to the following remarks of mine. Solomon possessed the spirit of wisdom, Daniel that of understanding and counsel, Moses that of might and piety, Elijah that of fear, and Isaiah that of knowledge. . . .Accordingly He rested, i.e., ceased, when He came, after whom, in the times of this dispensation wrought out by Him among men, it was requisite that such gifts should cease from you; and having received their rest in Him, should again, as had been predicted, become gifts which, from the grace of His Spirit's power, He imparts to those who believe in Him, according as He deems each man worthy thereof.   location 8203, 8209

And then, when Jesus had gone to the river Jordan, where John was baptizing, and when He had stepped into the water, a fire was kindled in the Jordan; and when He came out of the water, the Holy Ghost lit on Him like a dove, [as] the apostles of this very Christ of ours wrote. Now, we know that he did not go to the river because He stood in need of baptism, or of the descent of the Spirit like a dove; even as He submitted to be born and to be crucified, not because He needed such things, but because of the human race, which from Adam had fallen under the power of death and the guile of the serpent, and each one of which had committed personal transgression.   location 8230

For God, wishing both angels and men, who were endowed with free-will, and at their own disposal, to do whatever He had strengthened each to do, made them so, that if they chose the things acceptable to Himself, He would keep them free from death and from punishment; but that if they did evil, He would punish each as He sees fit.

[Trypho:] Moreover, I do also admit that the name of Jesus, by which the the son of Nave (Nun) was called, has inclined me very strongly to adopt this view. But whether Christ should be so shamefully crucified, this we are in doubt about. For whosoever is crucified is said in the Law to be accursed, so that I am exceedingly incredulous on this point. It is quite clear, indeed, that the Scriptures announce that Christ had to suffer; but we wish to learn if you can prove it to us whether it was by the suffering cursed in the Law." 
I replied to him. . .
[Ch 90]: You know, said I, that what the prophets said and did they veiled by parables and types, as you admitted to us; so that it was not easy for all to understand the most [of what they said], since they concealed the truth by these means, that those who are eager to find out and learn it might do so with much labor. . . .  
For Moses first exhibited this seeming curse of Christ's by the signs which he made.  . . . 
 When the people waged war with Amalek, and the son of Nave (Nun) by name Jesus (Joshua), led the fight, Moses himself prayed to God, stretching out both hands, and Hur with Aaron supported them during the whole day, so that they might not hang down when he got wearied. For if he gave up any part of this sign, which was an imitation of the cross, the people were beaten, as is recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained in this form, Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed by the cross. For it was not because Moses so prayed that the people were stronger, but because, while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was in the forefront of the battle, he himself made the sign of the cross. For who of you knows not that the prayer of one who accompanies it with lamentation and tears, with the body prostrate, or with bended knees, propitiates God most of all? But in such a manner neither he nor any other one, while sitting on a stone, prayed.

{Deut 33:17}
And God by Moses shows in another way the force of the mystery of the cross, when He said in the blessing wherewith Joseph was blessed, . . . "Let him be glorified among his brethren; his beauty is [like] the firstling of a bullock; his horns the horns of a unicorn: with these shall he push the nations from one end of the earth to another." Now, no one could say or prove that the horns of a unicorn represent any other fact or figure than the type which portrays the cross. For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to . . . and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn. And the part which is fixed in the center, on which are suspended those who are crucified, also stands out like a horn; and it also looks like a horn conjoined and fixed with the other horns. And the expression, "With these shall he push as with horns the nations from one end of the earth to another," is indicative of what is now the fact among all the nations. For some out of all the nations, through the power of this mystery, having been so pushed, that is, pricked in their hearts, have turned from vain idols and demons to serve God.  location 8279, 8282

For the Spirit of prophecy by Moses did not teach us to believe in the serpent, since it shows us that he was cursed by God from the beginning; and in Isaiah tells us that he shall be put to death as an enemy by the mighty sword, which is Christ.   location 8288

For tell me, was it not God who commanded by Moses that no image or likeness of anything which was in heaven above or which was on the earth should be made, and yet who caused the brazen serpent to be made by Moses in the wilderness, and set it up for a sign by which those bitten by serpents were saved? Yet is He free from unrighteousness. For by this, as I previously remarked, He proclaimed the mystery, by which He declared that He would break the power of the serpent which occasioned the transgression of Adam, and [would bring] to them that believe on Him [who was foreshadowed] by this sign, i.e., Him who was to be crucified, salvation from the fangs of the serpent, which are wicked deeds, idolatries, and other unrighteous acts. Unless the matter be so understood, give me a reason why Moses set up the brazen serpent for a sign, and bade those that were bitten gaze at it, and the wounded were healed; and this, too, when he had himself commanded that no likeness of anything whatsoever should be made. . . . Just as God commanded the sign to be made by the brazen serpent, and yet He is blameless; even so, though a curse lies in the Law against persons who are crucified, yet no curse lies on the Christ of God, by whom all who have committed things worthy of a curse are saved.   location 8348

For the whole human race will be found to be under a curse.

And no one has accurately done all, nor will you venture to deny this; but some more and some less than others have observed the ordinances enjoined. But if those who are under this Law appear to be under a curse for not having observed all the requirements, how much more shall all the nations appear to be under a curse who practice idolatry, who seduce youths, and commit other crimes? If, then, the Father of all wished His Christ for the whole human family to take upon Him the curses of all, knowing that, after He had been crucified and was dead, He would raise Him up, why do you argue about Him, who submitted to suffer these things according to the Father's will, as if He were accursed, and do not rather bewail yourselves?

For when they crucified Him, driving in the nails, they pierced His hands and feet; and those who crucified Him parted His garments among themselves, each casting lots for what he chose to have, and receiving according to the decision of the lot.

I shall repeat the whole Psalm, in order that you may hear His reverence to the Father, and how He refers all things to Him, and prays to be delivered by Him from this death; at the same time declaring in the Psalm who they are that rise up against Him, and showing that He has truly become man capable of suffering. It is as follows: "O God, my God, attend to me: why have you forsaken me?" (Ps 22) . . .

What is said at first-"O God, my God, attend to me: why have you forsaken me?" announced from the beginning that which was to be said in the time of Christ. For when crucified, He spoke: "O God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" And what follows: "The words of my transgressions are far from my salvation. O my God, I will cry to you in the day-time, and you will not hear; and in the night-season, and it is not for want of understanding in me." These, as well as the things which He was to do, were spoken. For on the day [fn] on which He was to be crucified, having taken three of His disciples to the hill called Olivet, situated opposite to the temple in Jerusalem, He prayed in these words: "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." And again He prayed: "Not as I will, but as you wilt;" showing by this that He had become truly a suffering man.

I have proved that it is not in the blessing of Joseph and Judah alone that what relates to Him was proclaimed mysteriously, but also in the Gospel it is written that He said: "All things are delivered unto me by My Father;" and, "No man knows the Father but the Son; nor the Son but the Father, and they to whom the Son will reveal Him." Accordingly He revealed to us all that we have perceived by His grace out of the Scriptures, so that we know Him to be the First-begotten of God, and to be before all creatures; likewise to be the Son of the patriarchs, since He assumed flesh by the virgin of their family, and submitted to become a man without comeliness, dishonored, and subject to suffering. Hence, also, among His words He said, when He was discoursing about His future sufferings: "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the Pharisees and Scribes, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again." He said then that He was the Son of man, either because of His birth by the virgin, who was, as I said, of the family of David and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham; or because Adam was the father both of Himself and of those who have been first enumerated from whom Mary derives her descent.

For Eve, who was a virgin and undefiled, having conceived the word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death.

For in the memoirs which I say were drawn up by His apostles and those who followed them, [it is recorded] that His sweat fell down like drops of blood while He was praying, and saying, "If it be possible, let this cup pass:" His heart and also His bones trembling; His heart being like wax melting in His belly: in order that we may perceive that the Father wished His Son really to undergo such sufferings for our sakes, and may not say that He, being the Son of God, did not feel what was happening to Him and inflicted on Him.   location 8506

And the statement, "You have brought me into the dust of death; for many dogs have surrounded me: the assembly of the wicked have beset me round. They pierced my hands and my feet. They did tell all my bones. They did look and stare upon me. They parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture,"-was a prediction, as I said before, of the death to which the synagogue of the wicked would condemn Him, whom He calls both dogs and hunters, declaring that those who hunted Him were both gathered together and assiduously striving to condemn Him.

{Ps 22:20-21; Angels}
For the passage, "Deliver my soul from the sword, and my only-begotten from the hand of the dog; save me from the lion's mouth, and my humility from the horns of the unicorns," is indicative of the suffering by which He should die, i.e., by crucifixion. For the "horns of the, unicorns," I have already explained to you, are the figure of the cross only. And the prayer that His soul should be saved from the sword, and lion's mouth, and hand of the dog, was a prayer that no one should take possession of His soul: so that, when we arrive at the end of life, we may ask the same petition from God, who is able to turn away every shameless evil angel from taking our souls.    location 8525

When we arrive at the end of life, we may ask the same petition from God, who is able to turn away every shameless evil angel from taking our souls. And that the souls survive, I have shown to you from the fact that the soul of Samuel was called up by the witch, as Saul demanded. And it appears also, that all the souls of similar righteous men and prophets fell under the dominion of such powers, as is indeed to be inferred from the very facts in the case of that witch. Hence also God by His Son teaches us for whose sake these things seem to have been done, always to strive earnestly, and at death to pray that our souls may not fall into the hands of any such power. For when Christ was giving up His spirit on the cross, He said, "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit," as I have learned also from the memoirs.   location 8527

{Ps 22:23-29}
The remainder of the Psalm makes it manifest that He knew His Father would grant to Him all things which He asked, and would raise Him from the dead; and that He urged all who fear God to praise Him because He had compassion on all races of believing men, through the mystery of Him who was crucified; and that He stood in the midst of His brethren the apostles (who repented of their flight from Him when He was crucified, after He rose from the dead, and after they were persuaded by Himself that, before His passion He had mentioned to them that He must suffer these things, and that they were announced beforehand by the prophets), and when living with them sang praises to God, as is made evident in the memoirs of the apostles. The words are the following: "I will declare your name to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I praise You. You that fear the Lord, praise Him; all you, the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. Let all the seed of Israel fear Him."

And since He spoke this obscurely, it was to be understood by the audience that after His crucifixion He should rise again on the third day. . . . for the latter [Ninevites] when Jonah preached to them, after he had been cast up on the third day from the belly of the great fish, that after three (in other versions, forty) days they should all perish, proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and beasts, with sackcloth, and with earnest lamentation, with true repentance from the heart, and turning away from unrighteousness, in the belief that God is merciful and kind to all who turn from wickedness; that after three [in other versions, forty] days they should all perish, proclaimed a fast of all creatures, men and beasts,   location 8554

This is as follows: "And in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the top of the mountains; it shall be exalted above the hills, and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and they shall enlighten us in His way, and we shall walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."

But the rest of the prophecy [of Micah 4] shall be fulfilled at His second coming. For the expression, "He that is afflicted [and driven out]," (Mic 4:6 LXX) i.e., from the world, [implies] that, so far as you and all other men have it in your power, each Christian has been driven out not only from his own property, but even from the whole world; for you permit no Christian to live. But you say that the same fate has befallen your own nation. Now, if you have been cast out after defeat in battle, you have suffered such treatment justly indeed, as all the Scriptures bear witness; but we, though we have done no such [evil acts] after we knew the truth of God, are testified to by God, that, together with the most righteous, and only spotless and sinless Christ, we are taken away out of the earth.

Since even Moses would in this way be considered a transgressor: for he enjoined that no likeness of anything in heaven, or on earth, or in the sea, be made; and then he himself made a brazen serpent and set it on a standard, and bade those who were bitten look at it: and they were saved when they looked at it. Will the serpent, then, which (I have already said) God had in the beginning cursed and cut off by the great sword, as Isaiah says, be understood as having preserved the people at that time? and shall we receive these things in the foolish acceptation of your teachers, and [regard] them not as signs? And shall we not rather refer the standard to the resemblance of the crucified Jesus, since also Moses by his outstretched hands, together with him who was named Jesus (Joshua), achieved a victory for your people? For in this way we shall cease to be at a loss about the things which the lawgiver did, when he, without forsaking God, persuaded the people to hope in a beast through which transgression and disobedience had their origin. And this was done and said by the blessed prophet with much intelligence and mystery; and there is nothing said or done by anyone of the prophets, without exception, which one can justly reprehend, if he possess the knowledge which is in them.

Therefore Christ has escaped your notice; and though you read, you understand not; and even now, though you hear that Jesus is our Christ, you consider not that the name was bestowed on Him not purposelessly nor by chance. But you make a theological discussion as to why one "a" was added to Abraham's first name; and as to why one "r" was added to Sarah's name, you use similar high-sounding disputations.

For I have shown that Christ was proclaimed by the prophets in parables a Stone and a Rock. Accordingly the knives of stone we shall take to mean His words, by means of which so many who were in error have been circumcised from uncircumcision with the circumcision of the heart, with which God by Jesus commanded those from that time to be circumcised who derived their circumcision from Abraham, saying that Jesus (Joshua) would circumcise a second time with knives of stone those who entered into that holy land.

And though the devil is ever at hand to resist us, and anxious to seduce all to himself, yet the Angel of God, i.e., the Power of God sent to us through Jesus Christ, rebukes him, and he departs from us And we are just as if drawn out from the fire, when purified from our former sins, and [rescued] from the affliction and the fiery trial by which the devil and all his coadjutors try us; out of which Jesus the Son of God has promised again to deliver us, and invest us with prepared garments, if we do His commandments; and has undertaken to provide an eternal kingdom [for us]. For just as that Jesus (Joshua), called by the prophet a priest, evidently had on filthy garments because he is said to have taken a harlot for a wife, and is called a brand plucked out of the fire, because he had received remission of sins when the devil that resisted him was rebuked; even so we, who through the name of Jesus have believed as one man in God the Maker of all, have been stripped, through the name of His first-begotten Son, of the filthy garments, i.e., of our sins; and being vehemently inflamed by the word of His calling, we are the true high priestly race of God, as even God Himself bears witness, saying that in every place among the Gentiles sacrifices are presented to Him well-pleasing and pure.

What larger measure of grace [favor], then, did Christ bestow on Abraham? This, namely, that He called him with His voice by the like calling, telling him to quit the land wherein he dwelt. And He has called all of us by that voice, and we have left already the way of living in which we used to spend our days, passing our time in evil after the fashions of the other inhabitants of the earth; and along with Abraham we shall inherit the holy land, when we shall receive the inheritance for an endless eternity, being children of Abraham through the like faith. For as he believed the voice of God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness, in like manner we having believed God's voice spoken by the apostles of Christ, and promulgated to us by the prophets, have renounced even to death all the things of the world. Accordingly, He promises to him a nation of similar faith, God-fearing, righteous, and delighting the Father; but it is not you, "in whom is no faith." location 8785

{Gen 26:4; Gen 28:14; Rom 2:28-29; Gal 3:7}
Observe, too, how the same promises are made to Isaac and to Jacob. For thus He speaks to Isaac: "And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." And to Jacob: "And in you and in your seed shall all families of the earth be blessed." He says that neither to Esau nor to Reuben, nor to any other; only to those of whom the Christ should arise, according to the dispensation, through the virgin Mary. But if you would consider the blessing of Judah, you would perceive what I say. For the seed is divided from Jacob, and comes down through Judah, and Phares, and Jesse, and David. And this was a symbol of the fact that some of your nation would be found children of Abraham, and found, too, in the lot of Christ; but that others, who are indeed children of Abraham, would be like the sand on the sea-shore, barren and fruitless, much in quantity, and without number indeed, but bearing no fruit whatever, and only drinking the water of the sea. And a vast multitude in your nation are convicted of being of this kind, imbibing doctrines of bitterness and godlessness, but spurning the word of God. location 8793

He speaks therefore in the passage relating to Judah: "A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a ruler from his thighs, till that which is laid up for him come; and He shall be the expectation of the nations." And it is plain that this was spoken not of Judah, but of Christ. For all we out of all nations do expect not Judah, but Jesus, who led your fathers out of Egypt. For the prophecy referred even to the advent of Christ: "Till He come for whom this is laid up, and He shall be the expectation of nations." Jesus came, therefore, as we have shown at length, and is expected again to appear above the clouds; whose name you profane, and labor hard to get it profaned over all the earth. It were possible for me, sirs," I continued, "to contend against you about the reading which you so interpret, saying it is written, "Till the things laid up for Him come;" though the Seventy have not so explained it, but thus, "Till He comes for whom this is laid up."

And this was a mysterious type of Christ being about to cut your nation in two, and to raise those worthy of the honor to the everlasting kingdom along with the holy patriarchs and prophets; but He has said that He will send others to the condemnation of the unquenchable fire along with similar disobedient and impenitent men from all the nations.

{Ps 72:17; Deut 4:19}
"His name shall rise up forever above the sun; and in Him shall all nations be blessed." . . . God formerly gave the sun as an object of worship, as it is written, but no one ever was seen to endure death on account of his faith in the sun; but for the name of Jesus you may see men of every nation who have endured and do endure all sufferings, rather than deny Him.

Hence also the Scripture said, "His name shall rise up above the sun." And again, Zechariah says, "His name is the East.' And speaking of the same, he says that "each tribe shall mourn." But if He so shone forth and was so mighty in His first advent (which was without honor and comeliness, and very contemptible), that in no nation He is unknown, and everywhere men have repented of the old wickedness in each nation's way of living, so that even demons were subject to His name, and all powers and kingdoms feared His name more than they feared all the dead, shall He not on His glorious advent destroy by all means all those who hated Him, and who unrighteously departed from Him, but give rest to His own, rewarding them with all they have looked for?   location 8823

Wherefore He said to Him: "It is a great thing for you to be called my Servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and turn again the dispersed of Israel. I have appointed you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be their salvation unto the end of the earth.". . . [Ch 122] You [Jews] think that these words refer to the stranger and the proselytes, but in fact they refer to us who have been illumined by Jesus. For Christ would have borne witness even to them; but now you are become twofold more the children of hell, as He said Himself. Therefore what was written by the prophets was spoken not of those persons [Jewish proselytes], but of us,   location 8829

Therefore what was written by the prophets was spoken not of those persons, but of us, concerning whom the Scripture speaks: "I will lead the blind by a way which they knew not; and they shall walk in paths which they have not known. And I am witness, says the Lord God, and my Servant whom I have chosen." To whom, then, does Christ bear witness? Manifestly to those who have believed. But the proselytes not only do not believe, but twofold more than yourselves blaspheme His name, and wish to torture and put to death us who believe in Him; for in all points they strive to be like you. And again in other words He cries: "I the Lord have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will strengthen you, and will give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the prisoners from their bonds." These words, indeed, sirs, refer also to Christ, and concern the enlightened nations; or will you say again, He speaks to them of the Law and the proselytes?" 
Then some of those [Jews] who had come on the second day cried out as if they had been in a theatre, "But what? does He not refer to the Law, and to those illumined by it? Now these are proselytes." "No," I said, looking towards Trypho, "since, if the Law were able to enlighten the nations and those who possess it, what need is there of a new covenant? But since God announced beforehand that He would send a new covenant, and an everlasting law and commandment, we will not understand this of the old law and its proselytes, but of Christ and His proselytes, namely us Gentiles, whom He has illumined   location 8834, 8843

What, then, is Christ's inheritance? Is it not the nations? What is the covenant of God? Is it not Christ? As He says in another place: "You art my Son; this day have I begotten You. Ask of Me, and I shall give you the nations for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession."

And it will be still more ridiculous for you, if you say that the law has been given to the nations, but you have not known it. For you would have stood in awe of God's wrath, and would not have been lawless, wandering sons; being much afraid of hearing God always say, "Children in whom is no faith. And who are blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that rule over them? And the servants of God have been made blind. You see often, but have not observed; your ears have been opened, and you have not heard." Is God's commendation of you honorable? and is God's testimony seemly for His servants? You are not ashamed though you often hear these words. You do not tremble at God's threats, for you are a people foolish and hard-hearted. "Therefore, behold, I will proceed to remove this people," says the Lord; "and I will remove them, and destroy the wisdom of the wise, and hide the understanding of the prudent." Deservedly too: for you are neither wise nor prudent, but crafty and unscrupulous; wise only to do evil, but utterly incompetent to know the hidden counsel of God, or the faithful covenant of the Lord, or to find out the everlasting paths. "Therefore, says the Lord, I will raise up to Israel and to Judah the seed of men and the seed of beasts." And by Isaiah He speaks thus concerning another Israel: "In that day shall there be a third Israel among the Assyrians and the Egyptians, blessed in the land which the Lord of Sabaoth has blessed, saying, blessed shall my people in Egypt and in Assyria be, and Israel mine inheritance." Since then God blesses this people, and calls them Israel, and declares them to be His inheritance, how is it that you repent not of the deception you practice on yourselves, as if you alone were the Israel,   location 8865

The words are spoken by David, and are, according to your [Jewish] version of them, thus: "God stands in the congregation of gods; He judges among the gods. How long do you judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? . . . I said, you are gods, and are all children of the Most High. But you die like men, and fall like one of the princes." But in the version of the Seventy it is written, "Behold, you die like men, and fall like one of the princes," in order to manifest the disobedience of men,-I mean of Adam and Eve,-and the fall of one of the princes, i.e., of him who was called the serpent.   location 8888

I must speak, then, in the hope of finding good ground somewhere; since that Lord of mine, as One strong and powerful, comes to demand back His own from all, and will not condemn His steward if He recognizes that he, by the knowledge that the Lord is powerful and has come to demand His own, has given it to every bank, and has not dug for any cause whatsoever.

[Justin sees Jacob's wrestling as a type of the following:] For when He became man, as I previously remarked, the devil came to Him-i.e., that power which is called the serpent and Satan-tempting Him, and striving to effect His downfall by asking Him to worship him. But He destroyed and overthrew the devil, having proved him to be wicked, in that he asked to be worshipped as God, contrary to the Scripture; who is an apostate from the will of God. For He answers him, "It is written, you shall worship the Lord your God." . . . But since our Christ was to be numbed, i.e., by pain and experience of suffering, He made a previous intimation of this by touching Jacob's thigh, and causing it to shrink.

For if you had understood what has been written by the prophets, you would not have denied that He was God, Son of the only, unbegotten, unutterable God. For Moses says somewhere in Exodus the following: "The Lord spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, being their God; and my name I revealed not to them, and I established my covenant with them." And thus again he says, "A man wrestled with Jacob," and asserts it was God; narrating that Jacob said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." And it is recorded that he called the place where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God (Peniel). location 8921

{Father and Son; Col 1:15; 1 Tim 1:17; Jn 1:18}
These and other such sayings are recorded by the lawgiver and by the prophets; and I suppose that I have stated sufficiently, that wherever God says, "God went up from Abraham," or, "The Lord spoke to Moses," and "The Lord came down to behold the tower which the sons of men had built," or when "God shut Noah into the ark," you must not imagine that the unbegotten God Himself came down or went up from any place. For the ineffable Father and Lord of all neither has come to any place, nor walks, nor sleeps, nor rises up, but remains in His own place, wherever that is, quick to behold and quick to hear, having neither eyes nor ears, but being of indescribable might; and He sees all things, and knows all things, and none of us escapes His observation; and He is not moved or confined to a spot in the whole world, for He existed before the world was made. How, then, could He talk with anyone, or be seen by anyone, or appear on the smallest portion of the earth, when the people at Sinai were not able to look even on the glory of Him who was sent from Him; and Moses himself could not enter into the tabernacle which he had erected, when it was filled with the glory of God; and the priest could not endure to stand before the temple when Solomon conveyed the ark into the house in Jerusalem which he had built for it? Therefore neither Abraham, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, nor any other man, saw the Father and ineffable Lord of all, and also of Christ, but [saw] Him who was according to His will His Son, being God, and the Angel because He ministered to His will; whom also it pleased Him to be born man by the virgin.
Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, Ch.127

{Father and Son}
[Justin, explaining a wrong view of the Word that some have:]  I know that some wish to anticipate these remarks, and to say that the power sent from the Father of all which appeared to Moses, or to Abraham, or to Jacob, is called an Angel because He came to men (for by Him the commands of the Father have been proclaimed to men); is called Glory, because He appears in a vision sometimes that cannot be borne; is called a Man, and a human being, because He appears arrayed in such forms as the Father pleases; and they call Him the Word, because He carries tidings from the Father to men: but maintain that this power is indivisible and inseparable from the Father, just as they say that the light of the sun on earth is indivisible and inseparable from the sun in the heavens; as when it sinks, the light sinks along with it; so the Father, when He chooses, say they, causes His power to spring forth, and when He chooses, He makes it return to Himself. In this way, they teach, He made the angels. But it is proved that there are angels who always exist, and are never reduced to that form out of which they sprang. And that this Power which the prophetic word calls God, as has been also amply demonstrated, and Angel, is not numbered [as different] in name only like the light of the sun but is indeed something numerically distinct,   location 8966

I will now adduce some passages which I had not recounted before. They are recorded by the faithful servant Moses in parable, and are as follows: "Rejoice, O you heavens, with Him, and let all the angels of God worship Him;" and I added what follows of the passage: "Rejoice, O you nations, with His people, and let all the angels of God be strengthened in Him: for the blood of His sons He avenges, and will avenge, and will recompense His enemies with vengeance, and will recompense those that hate Him; and the Lord will purify the land of His people." And by these words He declares that we, the nations, rejoice with His people, -to wit, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and, in short, all of that people who are well-pleasing to God, according to what has been already agreed on between us. But we will not receive it of all your nation. . . . [He] has shown that those who were selected out of every nation have obeyed His will through Christ,-whom He calls also Jacob, and names Israel, -and these, then, as I mentioned fully previously, must be Jacob and Israel. For when He says, "Rejoice, O you nations, with His people," He allots the same inheritance to them, and does not call them by the same name; but when He says that they as Gentiles rejoice with His people, He calls them Gentiles to reproach you. For even as you provoked Him to anger by your idolatry, so also He has deemed those who were idolaters worthy of knowing His will, and of inheriting His inheritance.    location 8996

He set the bounds of the nations according to the numbers of the children of Israel; and the Lord's portion became His people Jacob, and Israel was the lot of His inheritance."

{Polygamy; Jews}
Your imprudent and blind [Jewish] teachers, who even till this time permit each man to have four or five wives; and if anyone see a beautiful woman and desire to have her, they quote the doings of Jacob [called] Israel, and of the other patriarchs, and maintain that it is not wrong to do such things; for they are miserably ignorant in this matter.

Attend therefore to what I say. The marriages of Jacob were types of that which Christ was about to accomplish. For it was not lawful for Jacob to marry two sisters at once. And he serves Laban for [one of] the daughters; and being deceived in [the obtaining of] the younger, he again served seven years. Now Leah is your people and synagogue; but Rachel is our Church.

Rachel stole the gods of Laban, and has hid them to this day; and we have lost our paternal and material gods.

And when Scripture says, "I am the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who have made known Israel your King," will you not understand that truly Christ is the everlasting King? For you are aware that Jacob the son of Isaac was never a king. And therefore Scripture again, explaining to us, says what king is meant by Jacob and Israel: "Jacob is my Servant, I will uphold Him; and Israel is mine Elect, my soul shall receive Him. I have given Him my Spirit; and He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, and His voice shall not be heard without. The bruised reed He shall not break."

Then is it Jacob the patriarch in whom the Gentiles and yourselves shall trust? or is it not Christ? As, therefore, Christ is the Israel and the Jacob, even so we, who have been quarried out from the bowels of Christ, are the true Israelite race. But let us attend rather to the very word: "And I will bring forth," He says, "the seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah: and it shall inherit My holy mountain; and mine Elect and My servants shall possess the inheritance." Such are the words of Scripture; understand, therefore, that the seed of Jacob now referred to is something else, and not, as may be supposed, spoken of your people. For it is not possible for the seed of Jacob to leave an entrance for the descendants of Jacob, or for [God] to have accepted the very same persons whom He had reproached with unfitness for the inheritance, and promise it to them again; but as there the prophet says, "And now, O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the Lord; for He has sent away His people, the house of Jacob, because their land was full, as at the first, of soothsayers and divinations;" even so it is necessary for us here to observe that there are two seeds of Judah, and two races, as there are two houses of Jacob: the one begotten by blood and flesh, the other by faith and the Spirit.     location 9085

You know, then, sirs," I said, "that God has said in Isaiah to Jerusalem: "I saved you in the deluge of Noah." (Isa 54:9 variant reading) By this which God said was meant that the mystery of saved men appeared in the deluge. For righteous Noah, along with the other mortals at the deluge, i.e., with his own wife, his three sons and their wives, being eight in number, were a symbol of the eighth day, wherein Christ appeared when He rose from the dead, forever the first in power. For Christ, being the first-born of every creature, became again the chief of another race regenerated by Himself through Noah is a figure of Christ, who has regenerated us by water, and faith, and wood, containing the mystery of the cross; even as Noah was saved by wood when he rode over the waters with his household.

{Gen 9:25-27}
For another mystery was accomplished and predicted in the days of Noah, of which you are not aware. It is this: in the blessings wherewith Noah blessed his two sons, and in the curse pronounced on his son's son. For the Spirit of prophecy would not curse the son that had been by God blessed along with [his brothers]. But since the punishment of the sin would cleave to the whole descent of the son that mocked at his father's nakedness, he made the curse originate with his son. Now, in what he said, he foretold that the descendants of Shem would keep in retention the property and dwellings of Canaan: and again that the descendants of Japheth would take possession of the property of which Shem's descendants had dispossessed Canaan's descendants; and spoil the descendants of Shem, even as they plundered the sons of Canaan. And listen to the way in which it has so come to pass. For you, who have derived your lineage from Shem, invaded the territory of the sons of Canaan by the will of God; and you possessed it. And it is manifest that the sons of Japheth, having invaded you in turn by the judgment of God, have taken your land from you, and have possessed it. location 9136, 9143

We have as proof of this the one fall of David, which happened through his boasting, which was forgiven then when he so mourned and wept, as it is written. But if even to such a man no remission was granted before repentance, and only when this great king, and anointed one, and prophet, mourned and conducted himself so, how can the impure and utterly abandoned, if they weep not, and mourn not, and repent not, entertain the hope that the Lord will not impute to them sin?    location 9179

Then, having proceeded a little further, and wishing to mention the ancient lawgivers, he mentions Moses first. For he spoke in these words: "Among the Jews they say that Moses ascribed his laws to that God who is called Jehovah, whether because they judged it a marvelous and quite divine conception which promised to benefit a multitude of men, or because they were of opinion that the people would be the more obedient when they contemplated the majesty and power of those who were said to have invented the laws.    location 9438, 9441

Plato accordingly having learned this in Egypt, and being greatly taken with what was said about one God, did indeed consider it unsafe to mention the name of Moses, on account of his teaching the doctrine of one only God, for he dreaded the Areopagus; but what is very well expressed by him in his elaborate treatise, the Timaeus, he has written in exact correspondence with what Moses said regarding God, though he has done so, not as if he had learned it from him, but as if he were expressing his own opinion. For he said, "In my opinion, then, we must first define what that is which exists eternally, and has no generation, and what that is which is always being generated, but never really is."   location 9649

And God, the Father of the universe, who is the perfect intelligence, is the truth. And the Word, being His Son, came to us, having put on flesh, revealing both Himself and the Father, giving to us in Himself resurrection from the dead, and eternal life afterwards. And this is Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord. He, therefore, is Himself both the faith and the proof of Himself and of all things. Wherefore those who follow Him, and know Him, having faith in Him as their proof, shall rest in Him.    location 10224

{1 Jn 4:2-3; 2 Jn 7; Gnostics}
And there are some who maintain that even Jesus Himself appeared only as spiritual, and not in flesh, but presented merely the appearance of flesh: these persons seek to rob the flesh of the promise.    location 10240

{Mt 19:12; 1 Cor 7:7-9; 1 Cor 7:32-35; Rev 14:4-5}
(since we see many women who do not become pregnant, as those that are barren, even though they have wombs), so pregnancy is not the immediate and necessary consequence of having a womb; but those even who are not barren abstain from sexual intercourse, some being virgins from the first, and others from a certain time. And we see men also keeping themselves virgins, some from the first, and some from a certain time;  location 10250
Justin Martyr, On the Resurrection, ch 3

{Mt 22:30}
at the same time He foretold that, in the future world, sexual intercourse should be done away with; as He says, "The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage; but the children of the world to come neither marry nor are given in marriage, but shall be like the angels in heaven."    location 10260

{Greek Philosophy; 1 Cor 15:42-44}
There are some doctrines acknowledged by them [Greek philosophers] all in common, one of which is that neither can anything be produced from what is not in being, nor anything be destroyed or dissolved into what has not any being, and that the elements exist indestructible out of which all things are generated.  . . . God pervading them, and so re-make the body which they formerly made. Like as if a man shall make a composition of gold and silver, and brass and tin, and then shall wish to dissolve it again, so that each element exist separately, having again mixed them, he may, if he pleases, make the very same composition as he had    location 10310

{Ezek 18:20; 1 Cor 2:14; Mt 10:28; 1 Thess 5:23}
Quite true, say they; yet the flesh is a sinner, so much so, that it forces the soul to sin along with it. And thus they vainly accuse it, and lay to its charge alone the sins of both. But in what instance can the flesh possibly sin by itself, if it have not the soul going before it and inciting it? For as in the case of a yoke of oxen, if one or other is loosed from the yoke, neither of them can plough alone; so neither can soul or body alone effect anything, if they be unyoked from their communion.    location 10332
Justin Martyr, On the Resurrection, ch 8

{1 Thess 5:23}
For what is man but the reasonable animal composed of body and soul? Is the soul by itself man? No; but the soul of man. Would the body be called man? No, but it is called the body of man. If, then, neither of these is by itself man, but that which is made up of the two together is called man, and God has called man to life and resurrection, He has called not a part, but the whole, which is the soul and the body.    location 10347
Justin Martyr, On the Resurrection, ch 8

{Heb 10:22; Mt 10:28}
And by God and His proclamation, not only has your soul heard and believed on Jesus Christ, and with it the flesh, but both were washed, and both wrought righteousness. They make God, then ungrateful and unjust, if, while both believe on Him, He desires to save one and not the other.    location 10353

{1 Cor 15:42-44}
If He had no need of the flesh, why did He heal it? And what is most forcible of all, He raised the dead. Why? Was it not to show what the resurrection should be? How then did He raise the dead? Their souls or their bodies? Manifestly both.    location 10366

Justin Martyr, On the Resurrection, ch 9

{1 Thess 5:23}
The resurrection is a resurrection of the flesh which died. For the spirit dies not; the soul is in the body, and without a soul it cannot live. The body, when the soul forsakes it, is not. For the body is the house of the soul; and the soul the house of the spirit. These three, in all those who cherish a sincere hope and unquestioning faith in God, will be saved.   location 10379

{Heb 10:26-27}
[Irenaeus:] Justin well said: Before the advent of the Lord, Satan never ventured to blaspheme God, inasmuch as he was not yet sure of his own damnation, since that was announced concerning him by the prophets only in parables and allegories. But after the advent of the Lord learning plainly from the discourses of Christ and His apostles that eternal fire was prepared for him who voluntarily departed from God and for all who, without repentance, persevere in apostasy, then, by means of a man of this sort, he, as if already condemned, blasphemes that God who inflicts judgment upon him, and imputes the sin of his apostasy to his Maker, instead of to his own will and predilection. -Irenaeus: Heresies, v. 26.    location 10407

{Lev 14:1-7; Christ, Two Natures; Lk 24:27; Lk 24:44}
By the two birds, Christ is denoted, both dead as man, and living as God. He is likened to a bird, because He is understood and declared to be from above, and from heaven. And the living bird, having been dipped in the blood of the dead one, was afterwards let go. For the living and divine Word was in the crucified and dead temple [of the body], as being a partaker of the passion, and yet impassible to God. . . . By that which took place in the running water, in which the wood and the hyssop and the scarlet were dipped, is set forth the bloody passion of Christ on the cross for the salvation of those who are sprinkled with the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. . . . Wherefore the material for purification was not provided chiefly with reference to leprosy, but with regard to the forgiveness of sins, that both leprosy might be understood to be an emblem of sin, and the things which were sacrificed an emblem of Him who was to be sacrificed for sins.    location 10438

{Lev 16:20-22}
The goat that was sent away presented a type of Him who takes away the sins of men. But the two contained a representation of the one economy of God incarnate. For He was wounded for our transgressions, and He bore the sins of many, and He was delivered for our iniquities.   location 10444
Justin Martyr, Fragments from Lost Writings, sec X

{Gen 2:16-17; Heb 2:14-15; Rom 5:12; Atonement}
[Leontinus of Jerusalem quoting Justin]: "When God formed man at the beginning, He suspended the things of nature on his will, and made an experiment by means of one commandment. For He ordained that, if he kept this, he should partake of immortal existence; but if he transgressed it, the contrary should be his lot. Man having been thus made, and immediately looking towards transgression, naturally became subject to corruption. Corruption then becoming inherent in nature, it was necessary that He who wished to save should be one who destroyed the efficient cause of corruption. And this could not otherwise be done than by the life which is according to nature being united to that which had received the corruption, and so destroying the corruption, while preserving as immortal for the future that which had received it. It was therefore necessary that the Word should become possessed of a body, that He might deliver us from the death of natural corruption. For if, as you say, He had simply by a nod warded off death from us, death indeed would not have approached us on account of the expression of His will; but nonetheless would we again have become corruptible, inasmuch as we carried about in ourselves that natural corruption." -Leontius of Jerusalem (c. 485 - c. 543), Contra Nestorianos et Eutychianos, book ii.    location 10447

Rusticus the prefect said, "What is the dogma?" Justin said, "That according to which we worship the God of the Christians, whom we reckon to be one from the beginning, the maker and fashioner of the whole creation, visible and invisible; and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who had also been preached beforehand by the prophets as about to be present with the race of men, the herald of salvation and teacher of good disciples. And I, being a man, think that what I can say is insignificant in comparison with His boundless divinity, acknowledging a certain prophetic power, since it was prophesied concerning Him of whom now I say that He is the Son of God.

{Isa 44:24; Prov 8:22-25; Jn 1:1-3; Col 1:15-17; Father and Son; Logos}
For the Lord of the universe, who is Himself the necessary ground (hupostasis) of all being, inasmuch as no creature was yet in existence, was alone; but inasmuch as He was all power, Himself the necessary ground of things visible and invisible, with Him were all things; with Him, by Logos-power (dia logikes dunameos), the Logos Himself also, who was in Him, subsists. And by His simple will the Logos springs forth; and the Logos, not coming forth in vain, becomes the first-begotten work of the Father. Him (the Logos) we know to be the beginning of the world. But He came into being by participation, not by abscission; for what is cut off is separated from the original substance, but that which comes by participation, making its choice of function, does not render him deficient from whom it is taken. For just as from one torch many fires are lighted, but the light of the first torch is not lessened by the kindling of many torches, so the Logos, coming forth from the Logos-power of the Father, has not divested of the Logos-power Him who begat Him. I myself, for instance, talk, and you hear; yet, certainly, I who converse do not become destitute of speech (logos) by the transmission of speech, but by the utterance of my voice I endeavor to reduce to order the unarranged matter in your minds. And as the Logos, begotten in the beginning, begat in turn our world, having first created for Himself the necessary matter, so also I, in imitation of the Logos, being begotten again, and having become possessed of the truth, am trying to reduce to order the confused matter which is kindred with myself. For matter is not, like God, without beginning, nor, as having no beginning, is of equal power with God; it is begotten, and not produced by any other being, but brought into existence by the Framer of all things alone.    location 22225

And on this account we believe that there will be a resurrection of bodies after the consummation of all things;    … a resurrection once for all, when our periods of existence are completed, and in consequence solely of the constitution of things under which men alone live, for the purpose of passing judgment upon them.    … in the same way, having been born, and through death existing no longer, and seen no longer, I shall exist again, just as before I was not, but was afterwards born.   … Even though fire destroy all traces of my flesh, the world receives the vaporized matter; and though dispersed through rivers and seas, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, I am laid up in the storehouses of a wealthy Lord. And, although the poor and the godless know not what is stored up, yet God the Sovereign, when He pleases, will restore the substance that is visible to Him alone to its pristine condition.    location 22247

{Free Will; Col 1:16}
The Logos, too, before the creation of men, was the Framer of angels. And each of these two orders of creatures was made free to act as it pleased, not having the nature of good, which again is with God alone, but is brought to perfection in men through their freedom of choice, in order that the bad man may be justly punished, having become depraved through his own fault, but the just man be deservedly praised for his virtuous deeds, since in the exercise of his free choice he refrained from transgressing the will of God.   location 22253

{Rom 1:18-21; Predestination; Free Will}
But men form the material (hupothesis) of their apostasy. For, having shown them a plan of the position of the stars, like dice-players, they introduced Fate, a flagrant injustice.

We were not created to die, but we die by our own fault.  … Our free-will has destroyed us; we who were free have become slaves; we have been sold through sin.

The soul is not in itself immortal, O Greeks, but mortal. … Yet it is possible for the soul not to die. If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it does not die, although for a time it be dissolved.    location 22359

{1 Thess 5:23; Heb 4:12; Tripartite Nature of Man}
For the soul does not preserve the spirit, but is preserved by it,    … The Logos, in truth, is the light of God, but the ignorant soul is darkness. On this account, if the soul continues solitary, it tends downward towards matter, and dies with the flesh; but, if it enters into union with the divine spirit, it is no longer helpless, but ascends to the regions whither the spirit guides it: for the dwelling-place of the spirit is above, but the origin of the soul is from beneath. … Now, in the beginning the spirit was a constant companion of the soul, but the spirit forsook it because it was not willing to follow.    location 22366

{Heb 2:14; Rev 20:10}
These beings [demons] do not indeed die easily, for they do not partake of flesh; but while living they practice the ways of death, and die themselves as often as they teach their followers to sin. … Therefore, what is now the chief distinction [of demons], that they do not die like men, they will retain when about to suffer punishment: they will not partake of everlasting life, so as to receive this instead of death in a blessed immortality.    location 22377

{1 Cor 6:17; 1 Thess 5:23}
But further, it becomes us now to seek for what we once had, but have lost, to unite the soul with the Holy Spirit, and to strive after union with God. The human soul consists of many parts, and is not simple; it is composite, so as to manifest itself through the body; for neither could it ever appear by itself without the body, nor does the flesh rise again without the soul.    location 22385

But none of the demons possess flesh; their structure is spiritual, like that of fire or air. And only by those whom the Spirit of God dwells in and fortifies are the bodies of the demons easily seen, not at all by others,—I mean those who possess only soul; for the inferior has not the ability to apprehend the superior.

But medicine and everything included in it is an invention of the same kind. If anyone is healed by matter, through trusting to it, much more will he be healed by having recourse to the power of God. … For what reason do you not approach the more powerful Lord, but rather seek to cure yourself, like the dog with grass, or the stag with a viper, or the hog with river-crabs, or the lion with apes?    location 22444

I have often seen a man—and have been amazed to see, and the amazement has ended in contempt, to think how he is one thing internally, but outwardly counterfeits what he is not—giving himself excessive airs of daintiness and indulging in all sorts of effeminacy; sometimes darting his eyes about; sometimes throwing his hands hither and thither, and raving with his face smeared with mud; sometimes personating Aphrodite, sometimes Apollo;   … nor do I desire to be affected in sympathy with a man when he is winking and gesticulating in an unnatural manner.  … your daughters and your sons behold them giving lessons in adultery on the stage.   location 22518

And for these the witnesses take their seats, and the boxers meet in single combat, for no reason whatever, nor does anyone come down into the arena to succour.  … He who is chief among you collects a legion of blood-stained murderers, engaging to maintain them [as gladiators]; and these ruffians are sent forth by him, and you assemble at the spectacle to be judges, partly of the wickedness of the adjudicator, and partly of that of the men who engage in the combat. And he who misses the murderous exhibition is grieved, … You slaughter animals for the purpose of eating their flesh, and you purchase men to supply a cannibal banquet for the soul, nourishing it by the most impious bloodshedding.

by myself, I sought how I might be able to discover the truth. And, while I was giving my most earnest attention to the matter, I happened to meet with certain barbaric writings, too old to be compared with the opinions of the Greeks, and too divine to be compared with their errors; and I was led to put faith in these by the unpretending cast of the language, the inartificial character of the writers, the foreknowledge displayed of future events, the excellent quality of the precepts, and the declaration of the government of the universe as centred in one Being.

Not only do the rich among us pursue our philosophy, but the poor enjoy instruction gratuitously; for the things which come from God surpass the requital of worldly gifts.

{Moses}
But let Homer be not later than the Trojan war; let it be granted that he was contemporary with it, or even that he was in the army of Agamemnon, and, if any so please, that he lived before the invention of letters. The Moses before mentioned will be shown to have been many years older than the taking of Troy, and far more ancient than the building of Troy, or than Tros and Dardanus. To demonstrate this I will call in as witnesses the Chaldeans, the Phoenicians and the Egyptians.   … Berosus, a Babylonian, a priest of their god Belus, born in the time of Alexander, composed for Antiochus, the third after him, the history of the Chaldeans in three books; and, narrating the acts of the kings, he mentions one of them, Nabuchodonosor by name, who made war against the Phoenicians and the Jews,—events which we know were announced by our prophets, and which happened much later than the age of Moses,    location 22703

Now, in the histories of the aforesaid writers it is shown that the abduction of Europa happened under one of the kings, and an account is given of the coming of Menelaus into Phoenicia, and of the matters relating to Chiramus [Hiram], who gave his daughter in marriage to Solomon the king of the Jews, and supplied wood of all kind of trees for the building of the temple. Menander of Pergamus composed a history concerning the same things.

{Encratites; Tatian}
Tatian, who maintaining the imaginary flesh of Christ, pronounces all sexual connection impure, who was also the very violent heresiarch of the Encratites, employs an argument of this sort: "If anyone sows to the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption;" but he sows to the flesh who is joined to a woman; therefore he who takes a wife and sows in the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption.—Hieron.: Com. in Ep. ad Gal.    location 22778

{Encratites; Tatian}
VII But Tatian, not understanding that the expression "Let there be" is not always precative but sometimes imperative, most impiously imagined concerning God, who said "Let there be light," that He prayed rather than commanded light to be, as if, as he impiously thought, God was in darkness.—Origen: De Orat.    location 22794

X "But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not." On this, perhaps, Tatian the chief of the Encratites endeavors to build his heresy, asserting that wine is not to be drunk, since it was commanded in the law that the Nazarites were not to drink wine, and now those who give the Nazarites wine are accused by the prophet.—Hieron.: Com. in Amos.    location 22802

{Roman Law; Persecution}
In your empire, greatest of sovereigns, different nations have different customs and laws; and no one is hindered by law or fear of punishment from following his ancestral usages, however ridiculous these may be. . . . In short, among every nation and people, men offer whatever sacrifices and celebrate whatever mysteries they please. The Egyptians reckon among their gods even cats, and crocodiles, and serpents, and asps, and dogs. And to all these both you and the laws give permission so to act, deeming, on the one hand, that to believe in no god at all is impious and wicked, and on the other, that it is necessary for each man to worship the gods he prefers. . . . And the whole empire, under your intelligent sway, enjoys profound peace.  . . . But for us who are called Christians you have not in like manner cared; but although we commit no wrong-nay, as will appear in the sequel of this discourse, are of all men most piously and righteously disposed towards the Deity and towards your government-you allow us to be harassed, plundered, and persecuted, the multitude making war upon us for our name alone.   location 24109

{Roman Law; Persecution}
For it does not comport with your justice, that others when charged with crimes should not be punished till they are convicted, but that in our case the name we bear should have more force than the evidence adduced on the trial, when the judges, instead of inquiring whether the person arraigned have committed any crime, vent their insults on the name, as if that were itself a crime.   location 24126

{Father and Son; Apostles Creed; Logos}
We acknowledge one God, uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible, incomprehensible, illimitable, who is apprehended by the understanding only and the reason, who is encompassed by light, and beauty, and spirit, and power ineffable, by whom the universe has been created through His Logos, and set in order, and is kept in being-I have sufficiently demonstrated. [I say "His Logos"], for we acknowledge also a Son of God. Nor let anyone think it ridiculous that God should have a Son. For though the poets, in their fictions, represent the gods as no better than men, our mode of thinking is not the same as theirs, concerning either God the Father or the Son. But the Son of God is the Logos of the Father, in idea and in operation; for after the pattern of Him and by Him were all things made, the Father and the Son being one. And, the Son being in the Father and the Father in the Son, in oneness and power of spirit, the understanding and reason (nous kai logos) of the Father is the Son of God.   location 24247  
Athenagoras, A Plea for the Christians, Ch. 10

{Father and Son; Logos; Son, Begetting of; Jn 1:1; Prov 8:22-25; Ps 110:3}
if, in your surpassing intelligence, it occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I will state briefly that He is the first product of the Father, not as having been brought into existence (for from the beginning, God, who is the eternal mind [nous], had the Logos in Himself, being from eternity instinct with Logos [logikos]); but inasmuch as He came forth to be the idea and energizing power of all material things, which lay like a nature without attributes, and an inactive earth, the heavier particles being mixed up with the lighter. location 24254

{Prov 8:22-25; Trinity}
The prophetic Spirit also agrees with our statements. "The Lord," it says, "made me, the beginning of His ways to His works." The Holy Spirit Himself also, which operates in the prophets, we assert to be an effluence of God, flowing from Him, and returning back again like a beam of the sun. Who, then, would not be astonished to hear men who speak of God the Father, and of God the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and who declare both their power in union and their distinction in order, and who declare both their power in union and their distinction in order, called atheists?   location 24258

{Angels}
Nor is our teaching in what relates to the divine nature confined to these points; but we recognize also a multitude of angels and ministers,731 whom God 134 the Maker and Framer of the world distributed and appointed to their several posts by His Logos, to occupy themselves about the elements, and the heavens, and the world, and the things in it, and the goodly ordering of them all.

{Mt 5:44-45; Christianity, Essence of}
If I go minutely into the particulars of our doctrine, let it not surprise you. It is that you may not be carried away by the popular and irrational opinion, but may have the truth clearly before you. For presenting the opinions themselves to which we adhere, as being not human but uttered and taught by God, we shall be able to persuade you not to think of us as atheists. What, then, are those teachings in which we are brought up? "I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that persecute you; that you may be the sons of your Father who is in heaven, who causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust." Allow me here to lift up my voice boldly in loud and audible outcry, pleading as I do before philosophic princes. For who of . . . them have so purged their souls as, instead of hating their enemies, to love them; and, instead of speaking ill of those who have reviled them (to abstain from which is of itself an evidence of no mean forbearance), to bless them; and to pray for those who plot against their lives? On the contrary, they never cease with evil intent to search out skilfully the secrets of their art, and are ever bent on working some ill, making the art of words and not the exhibition of deeds their business and profession.   location 24268

But among us you will find uneducated persons, and artisans, and old women, who, if they are unable in words to prove the benefit of our doctrine, yet by their deeds exhibit the benefit arising from their persuasion of its truth: they do not rehearse speeches, but exhibit good works; when struck, they do not strike again; when robbed, they do not go to law; they give to those that ask of them, and love their neighbors as themselves.   location 24276

{2 Cor 7:1; Heb 10:26-31; Salvation-Stage Two}
Should we, then, unless we believed that a God presides over the human race, thus purge ourselves from evil? Most certainly not. But, because we are persuaded that we shall give an account of everything in the present life to God, who made us and the world, we adopt a temperate and benevolent and generally despised method of life, believing that we shall suffer no such great evil here, even should our lives be taken from us, compared with what we shall there receive for our meek and benevolent and moderate life from the great Judge. location 24281

Are, then, those who consider life to be comprised in this, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," and who regard death as a deep sleep and forgetfullness ("sleep and death, twin brothers"), to be accounted pious, while men who reckon the present life of very small worth indeed, and who are conducted to the future life by this one thing alone, that they know God and His Logos, what is the oneness of the Son with the Father, what the communion of the Father with the Son, what is the Spirit, what is the unity of these three, the Spirit, the Son, the Father, and their distinction in unity; and who know that the life for which we look is far better than can be described in words, provided we arrive at it pure from all wrong-doing; who, moreover, carry our benevolence to such an extent, that we not only love our friends ("for if you love them," He says, "that love you, and lend to them that lend to you, what reward will you have?",-shall we, I say, when such is our character, and when we live such a life as this, that we may escape condemnation at last, not be accounted pious?   location 24286

And first, as to our not sacrificing: the Framer and Father of this universe does not need blood, nor the odor of burnt-offerings, nor the fragrance of flowers and incense, forasmuch as He is Himself perfect fragrance, needing nothing either within or without; but the noblest sacrifice to Him is for us to know who stretched out and vaulted the heavens, and fixed the earth in its place like a center,    location 24299

{Pagan Religion; Accusations Against Christians, True}
Then, as to the other complaint, that we do not pray to and believe in the same gods as the cities, it is an exceedingly silly one. Why, the very men who charge us with atheism for not admitting the same gods as they acknowledge, are not agreed among themselves concerning the gods. When, therefore, they differ among themselves concerning their gods, why do they bring the charge against us of not agreeing with them? . . . Then all cities and all nations are guilty of impiety, for they do not all acknowledge the same gods.   location 24321

{Rom 1:20-23}
And as we do not hold the pottery of more worth than him who made it, nor the vessels of glass and gold than him who wrought them; but if there is anything about them elegant in art we praise the artificer, and it is he who reaps the glory of the vessels: even so with matter and God-the glory and honor of the orderly arrangement of the world belongs of right not to matter, but to God, the Framer of matter. So that, if we were to regard the various forms of matter as gods, we should seem to be without any sense of the true God, because we should be putting the things which are dissoluble and perishable on a level with that which is eternal.

{Gen 1:31; Ps 136:5; Prov 3:19}
Beautiful without doubt is the world, excelling, as well in its magnitude as in the arrangement of its parts, both those in the oblique circle and those about the north, and also in its spherical form. Yet it is not this, but its Artificer, that we must worship. For when any of your subjects come to you, they do not neglect to pay their homage to you, their rulers and lords, from whom they will obtain whatever they need, and address themselves to the magnificence of your palace; but, if they chance to come upon the royal residence, they bestow a passing glance of admiration on its beautiful structure: but it is to you yourselves that they show honor, as being "all in all."   location 24337

But, since it is affirmed by some that, although these are only images, yet there exist gods in honor of whom they are made; and that the supplications and sacrifices presented to the images are to be referred to the gods, and are in fact made to the gods;. . . and whereas, in proof that such is the fact, they adduce the energies possessed by certain images, let us examine into the power attached to their names.

First Thales, as those who have accurately examined his opinions report, divides [superior beings] into God, demons, and heroes. God he recognizes as the Intelligence (nous) of the world; by demons he understands beings possessed of soul (psuchikai); and by heroes the separated souls of men, the good being the good souls, and the bad the worthless. Plato again, while withholding his assent on other points, also divides [superior beings] into the uncreated God and those produced by the uncreated One for the adornment of heaven, the planets, and the fixed stars, and into demons;   location 24543

Just as with men, who have freedom of choice as to both virtue and vice (for you would not either honor the good or punish the bad, unless vice and virtue were in their own power; and some are diligent in the matters entrusted to them by you, and others faithless), so is it among the angels. Some, free agents, you will observe, such as they were created by God, continued in those things for which God had made and over which He had ordained them; but some outraged both the constitution of their nature and the government entrusted to them:   location 24583

So is it among the angels. Some, free agents, you will observe, such as they were created by God, continued in those things for which God had made and over which He had ordained them; but some outraged both the constitution of their nature and the government entrusted to them: namely, this ruler of matter and its various forms, and others of those who were placed about this first firmament (you know that we say nothing without witnesses, but state the things which have been declared by the prophets); these fell into impure love of virgins, and were subjugated by the flesh, and he became negligent and wicked in the management of the things entrusted to him. Of these lovers of virgins, therefore, were begotten those who are called giants. And if something has been said by the poets, too, about the giants, be not surprised at this: worldly wisdom and divine differ as much from each other as truth and plausibility: the one is of heaven and the other of earth.   location 24588

Those, therefore, to whom either the subjects gave honor or the rulers themselves [assumed it], obtained the name, some from fear, others from revenge. Thus Antinous, through the benevolence of your ancestors towards their subjects, came to be regarded as a god. But those who came after adopted the worship without examination. "The Cretans always lie; for they, O king, Have built a tomb to you who art not dead." Though you believe, O Callimachus, in the nativity of Zeus, you do not believe in his sepulcher; and whilst you think to obscure the truth, you in fact proclaim him dead, even to those who are ignorant; and if you see the cave, you call to mind the childbirth of Rhea; but when you see the coffin, you throw a shadow over his death, not considering that the unbegotten God alone is eternal.   location 24717

The former charge, therefore, being false, if anyone should ask them in regard to the second, whether they have seen what they assert, not one of them would be so barefaced as to say that he had. And yet we have slaves, some more and some fewer, by whom we could not help being seen; but even of these, not one has been found to invent even such things against us. For when they know that we cannot endure even to see a man put to death, though justly; who of them can accuse us of murder or cannibalism?   location 24789

God as judging men according as they have lived well or ill, . . . (for the award according to merit finds no place in the present existence, since many atheists and persons who practice every iniquity and wickedness live on to the last, unvisited by calamity, whilst, on the contrary, those who have manifestly lived an exemplary life in respect of every virtue, live in pain, in insult, in calumny and outrage, and suffering of all kinds)   location 25190

{Rom 2:6-10; Jn 5:28-29; Rev 20:12-13; 1 Cor 15:32}
For if no judgment whatever were to be passed on the actions of men, men would have no advantage over the irrational creatures, but rather would fare worse than these do, inasmuch as they keep in subjection their passions, and concern themselves about piety, and righteousness, and the other virtues; and a life after the manner of brutes would be the best, virtue would be absurd, the threat of judgment a matter for broad laughter, indulgence in every kind of pleasure the highest good, and the common resolve of all these and their one law would be that maxim, so dear to the intemperate and lewd, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." For the termination of such a life is not even pleasure, as some suppose, but utter insensibility. 
But if the Maker of men takes any concern about His own works, and the distinction is anywhere to be found between those who have lived well and ill, it must be either in the present life, while men are still living who have conducted themselves virtuously or viciously, or after death, when men are in a state of separation and dissolution. But according to neither of these suppositions can we find a just judgment taking place; for neither do the good in the present life obtain the rewards of virtue, nor yet do the bad receive the wages of vice. 
I pass over the fact that so long as the nature we at present possess is preserved, the moral nature is not able to bear a punishment commensurate with the more numerous or more serious faults. For the robber, or ruler, or tyrant, who has unjustly put to death myriads on myriads, could not by one death make restitution for these deeds; and the man who holds no true opinion concerning God, but lives in all outrage and blasphemy, despises divine things, breaks the laws, commits outrage against boys and women alike, razes cities unjustly, burns houses with their inhabitants, and devastates a country, and at the same time destroys inhabitants of cities and peoples, and even an entire nation-how in a mortal body could he endure a penalty adequate to these crimes, since death prevents the deserved punishment, and the mortal nature does not suffice for any single one of his deeds? It is proved, therefore, that neither in the present life is there a judgment according to men's deserts, nor after death [if there is no resurrection].   location 25211
Athenagoras, On the Resurrection of the Dead, Ch. 19
{1 Cor 15:42-44; Ezek 18:4; Mt 10:28; Jn 5:28-29} 
For either death is the entire extinction of life, the soul being dissolved and corrupted along with the body, or the soul remains by itself, incapable of dissolution, of dispersion, of corruption, whilst the body is corrupted and dissolved, retaining no longer any remembrance of past actions, nor sense of what it experienced in connection with the soul. If the life of men is to be utterly extinguished, it is manifest there will be no care for men who are not living, no judgment respecting those who have lived in virtue or in vice; but there will rush in again upon us whatever belongs to a lawless life, and the swarm of absurdities which follow from it, and that which is the summit of this lawlessness-atheism. 

But if the body were to be corrupted, and each of the dissolved particles to pass to its kindred element, yet the soul to remain by itself as immortal, neither on this supposition would any judgment on the soul take place, since there would be an absence of equity: for it is unlawful to suspect that any judgment can proceed out of God and from God which is wanting in equity. Yet equity is wanting to the judgment, if the being is not preserved in existence who practiced righteousness or lawlessness: for that which practiced each of the things in life on which the judgment is passed was man, not soul by itself.

For, just as it is impossible that material substance should partake of salvation (since, indeed, they maintain that it is incapable of receiving it), so again it is impossible that spiritual substance (by which they mean themselves) should ever come under the power of corruption, whatever the sort of actions in which they indulged.   location 10847

Paul, too, very plainly set forth the material, animal, and spiritual, saying in one place, "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;" and in another place, "But the animal man receives not the things of the Spirit;" and again: "He that is spiritual judges all things."

But the fact referred to simply implies this, that one may [more accurately than another] bring out the meaning of those things which have been spoken in parables, and accommodate them to the general scheme of the faith; and explain [with special clearness] the operation and dispensation of God connected with human salvation; and show that God manifested longsuffering in regard to the apostasy of the angels who transgressed, as also with respect to the disobedience of men; and set forth why it is that one and the same God has made some things temporal and some eternal, some heavenly and others earthly; and understand for what reason God, though invisible, manifested Himself to the prophets not under one form, but differently to different individuals; and show why it was that more covenants tha person were given to mankind; and teach what was the special character of each of these covenants; and search out for what reason "God has concluded every man in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all;" and gratefully describe on what account the Word of God became flesh and suffered; and relate why the advent of the Son of God took place in these last times, that is, in the end, rather than in the beginning [of the world]; and unfold what is contained in the Scriptures concerning the end [itself], and things to come; and not be silent as to how it is that God has made the Gentiles, whose salvation was despaired of, fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers with the saints; and discourse how it is that "this mortal body shall put on immortality, and this corruptible shall put on incorruption;" and proclaim in what sense [God] says, "That is a people who was not a people; and she is beloved who was not beloved;" and in what sense He says that "more are the children of her that was desolate, than of her who possessed a husband." For in reference to these points, and others of a like nature, the apostle exclaims: "Oh! the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"

When this has been done, he himself produces another cup of much larger size than that which the deluded woman has consecrated, and pouring from the smaller one consecrated by the woman into that which has been brought forward by himself, he at the same time pronounces these words: "May that Charis who is before all things, and who transcends all knowledge and speech, fill your inner man."   location 11206

"Behold Charis has descended upon you; open your mouth and prophesy." On the woman replying, "I have never at any time prophesied, nor do I know how to prophesy;" then engaging, for the second time, in certain invocations, so as to astound his deluded victim, he says to her, "Open your mouth, speak whatsoever occurs to you, and you shall prophesy." She then, vainly puffed up and elated by these words, and greatly excited in soul by the expectation that it is herself who is to prophesy, her heart beating violently [from emotion], reaches the requisite pitch of audacity, and idly as well as impudently utters some nonsense as it happens to occur to her, such as might be expected from one heated by an empty spirit.    location 11214

They [Gnostics] proclaim themselves as being "perfect," so that no one can be compared to them with respect to the immensity of their knowledge, nor even were you to mention Paul or Peter, or any other of the apostles. They assert that they themselves know more than all others, and that they alone have imbibed the greatness of the knowledge of that power which is unspeakable. They also maintain that they have attained to a height above all power, and that therefore they are free in every respect to act as they please, having no one to fear in anything. For they affirm, that because of the "Redemption" it has come to pass that they can neither be apprehended, nor even seen by the judge.

1. Besides the above [misrepresentations], they adduce an unspeakable number of apocryphal and spurious writings, which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish men, . . . Among other things, they bring forward that 345 false and wicked story which relates that our Lord, when He was a boy learning His letters, on the teacher saying to Him, as is usual, "Pronounce Alpha," replied [as He was bid], "Alpha." But when, again, the teacher bade Him say, "Beta," the Lord replied, "Do you first tell me what Alpha is, and then I will tell you what Beta is." This they expound as meaning that He alone knew the Unknown, which He revealed under its type Alpha.

And this they maintain to be the redemption. They, too, are accustomed to anoint with balsam. Others, however, reject all these practices, and maintain that the mystery of the unspeakable and invisible power ought not to be performed by visible and corruptible creatures, nor should that of those [beings] who are inconceivable, and incorporeal, and beyond the reach of sense, [be performed] by such as are the objects of sense, and possessed of a body.

{Ps 33:6; Jn 1:1; Jn 1:3; Apostles Creed}
1. The rule of truth which we hold, is, that there is one God Almighty, who made all things by His Word, and fashioned and formed, out of that which had no existence, all things which exist. Thus says the Scripture, to that effect "By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all the might of them, by the spirit of His mouth." And again, "All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made." There is no exception or deduction stated; but the Father made all things by Him, whether visible or invisible, objects of sense or of intelligence, temporal, on account of a certain character given them, or eternal; and these eternal things He did not make by angels, or by any powers separated from His Ennoea. For God needs none of all these things, but is He who, by His Word and Spirit, makes, and disposes, and governs all things, and commands all things into existence,-He who formed the world (for the world is of all),-He who fashioned man,-He [who] is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, above whom there is no other God, nor initial principle, nor power, nor pleroma,-He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we shall prove.

{Acts 8:9-11; Acts 8:22-24; Simon Magus; Father and Son}
1. Simon the Samaritan was that magician of whom Luke, the disciple and follower of the apostles, says, "But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime used magical arts in that city, and led astray the people of Samaria, declaring that he himself was some great one, to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This is the power of God, which is called great. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had driven them mad by his sorceries." This Simon, then-who feigned faith, supposing that the apostles themselves performed their cures by the art of magic, and not by the power of God; and with respect to their filling with the Holy Ghost, through the imposition of hands, those that believed in God through Him who was preached by them, namely, Christ Jesus-suspecting that even this was done through a kind of greater knowledge of magic, and offering money to the apostles, thought he, too, might receive this power of bestowing the Holy Spirit on whomsoever he would,-was addressed in these words by Peter: "Thy money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God can be purchased with money: you have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God; for I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity." He, then, not putting faith in God a whit the more, set himself eagerly to contend against the apostles, in order that he himself might seem to be a wonderful being, and applied himself with still greater zeal to the study of the whole magic art, that he might the better bewilder and overpower multitudes of men. Such was his procedure in the reign of Claudius Caesar, by whom also he is said to have been honored with a statue, on account of his magical power. This man, then, was glorified by many as if he were a god; and he taught that it was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, but descended in Samaria as the Father while he came to other nations in the character of the Holy Spirit. He represented himself, in a word, as being the loftiest of all powers, that is, the Being who is the Father over all, and he allowed himself to be called by whatsoever title men were pleased to address him.

This heretic was the first to affirm that two kinds of men were formed by the angels,-the one wicked, and the other good. They declare also, that marriage and generation are from Satan.

[According to Basilides:] But the Father who is without birth and without name, perceiving that they would be destroyed, sent his own first-begotten Nous (he it is who is called Christ) to bestow deliverance on them that believe in him, from the power of those who made the world. He appeared, then, on earth as a man, to the nations of these powers, and wrought miracles. Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all. Those, then, who know these things have been freed from the principalities who formed the world; so that it is not incumbent on us to confess him who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was thought to be crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the father, that by this dispensation he might destroy the works of the makers of the world. If anyone, therefore, he declares, confesses the crucified, that man is still a slave, and under the power of those who formed our bodies; but he who denies him has been freed from these beings, and is acquainted with the dispensation of the unborn father.

They also hold that Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was just like other men, with the exception that he differed from them in this respect, that inasmuch as his soul was steadfast and pure, he perfectly remembered those things which he had witnessed2945 within the sphere of the unbegotten God. On this account, a power descended upon him from the Father, that by means of it he might escape from the creators of the world; and they say that it, after passing through them all, and remaining in all points free, ascended again to him, and to the powers,2946 which in the same way embraced like things to itself.

Truly, I say unto you, you shall not go out thence until you pay the very last farthing."2952 They also declare the "adversary" is one of those angels who are in the world, whom they call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose, that he might lead those souls which have perished from the world to the Supreme Ruler. They describe him also as being chief among the makers of the world, and maintain that he delivers such souls [as have been mentioned] to another angel, who ministers to him, that he may shut them up in other bodies; for they declare that the body is "the prison." Again, they interpret these expressions, "You shall not go out thence until you pay the very last farthing," as meaning that no one can escape from the power of those angels who made the world, but that he must pass from body to body, until he has experience of every kind of action which can be practiced in this world, and when nothing is longer wanting to him, then his liberated soul should soar upwards to that God who is above the angels, the makers of the world.

[According to them,] we are saved, indeed, by means of faith and love; but all other things, while in their nature indifferent, are reckoned by the opinion of men-some good and some evil, there being nothing really evil by nature.

Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the primary God, but by a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance from that Principality who is supreme over the universe, and ignorant of him who is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. Moreover, after his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and performed miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.

They use the Gospel according to Matthew only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an apostate from the Law. As to the prophetical writings, they endeavor to expound them in a somewhat singular manner: they practice circumcision, persevere in the observance of those customs which are enjoined by the Law, and are so Judaic in their style of life, that they even adore Jerusalem as if it were the house of God.   location 11831

In so doing, he advanced the most daring blasphemy against Him who is proclaimed as God by the Law and the prophets, declaring Him to be the author of evils, to take delight in war, to be infirm of purpose, and even to be contrary to Himself. But Jesus being derived from that father who is above the God that made the world, and coming into Judaea in the times of Pontius Pilate the governor, who was the procurator of Tiberius Caesar, was manifested in the form of a man to those who were in Judaea, abolishing the prophets and the Law, and all the works of that God who made the world, whom also he calls Cosmocrator.   location 11844

Besides this, he mutilates the Gospel which is according to Luke, removing all that is written respecting the generation of the Lord, and setting aside a great deal of the teaching of the Lord, in which the Lord is recorded as most dearly confessing that the Maker of this universe is His Father. He likewise persuaded his disciples that he himself was more worthy of credit than are those apostles who have handed down the Gospel to us, furnishing them not with the Gospel, but merely a fragment of it. In like manner, too, he dismembered the Epistles of Paul, removing all that is said by the apostle respecting that God who made the world, to the effect that He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and also those passages from the prophetical writings which the apostle quotes, in order to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of the Lord.   location 11848

But . . . Marcion declared that Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and those other righteous men who sprang from the patriarch Abraham, with all the prophets, and those who were pleasing to God, did not partake in salvation. For since these men, he says, knew that their God was constantly tempting them, so now they suspected that He was tempting them, and did not run to Jesus, or believe His announcement: and for this reason he declared that their souls remained in Hades.

This arises from the fact that numbers of them-indeed, we may say all-desire themselves to be teachers, and to break off from the particular heresy in which they have been involved.

To give an example: Springing from Saturninus and Marcion, those who are called Encratites (self-controlled) preached against marriage, thus setting aside the original creation of God, and indirectly blaming Him who made the male and female for the propagation of the human race. Some of those reckoned among them have also introduced abstinence from animal food, thus proving themselves ungrateful to God, who formed all things. They deny, too, the salvation of him who was first created. It is but lately, however, that this opinion has been invented among them. A certain man named Tatian first introduced the blasphemy. He was a hearer of Justin's, and as long as he continued with him he expressed no such views; but after [Justin's] martyrdom he separated from the Church, and, excited and puffed up by the thought of being a teacher, as if he were superior to others, he composed his own peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system of certain invisible Aeons, like the followers of Valentinus; while, like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was nothing else than corruption and fornication. But his denial of Adam's salvation was an opinion due entirely to himself.     location 11875

For Sophia was in the habit of carrying off that which belonged to her from them to herself. They declare that Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things, and that he alone, knowing the truth as no others did, accomplished the mystery of the betrayal; by him all things, both earthly and heavenly, were thus thrown into confusion. They produce a fictitious history of this kind, which they style the Gospel of Judas.

{Father and Son; 1 Cor 8:6; Eph 4:5-6}
1. It is proper, then, that I should begin with the first and most important head, that is, God the Creator, who made the heaven and the earth, and all things that are therein (whom these men blasphemously style the fruit of a defect), and to demonstrate that there is nothing either above Him or after Him; nor that, influenced by anyone, but of His own free will, He created all things, since He is the only God, the only Lord, the only Creator, the only Father, alone containing all things, and Himself commanding all things into existence.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.1, sec 1

{Pleroma}
2. For how can there be any other Fullness, or Principle, or Power, or God, above Him, since it is matter of necessity that God, the Pleroma (Fullness) of all these, should contain all things in His immensity, and should be contained by no one? But if there is anything beyond Him, He is not then the Pleroma of all, nor does He contain all. For that which they declare to be beyond Him will be wanting to the Pleroma

{Jn 1:3}
But it will not be regarded as at all probable by those who know that God stands in need of nothing, and that He created and made all things by His Word, while He neither required angels to assist Him in the production of those things which are made, nor of any power greatly inferior to Himself, and ignorant of the Father, nor of any defect or ignorance, in order that he who should know Him might become man.

{1 Cor 15:38-44}
But He Himself in Himself, after a fashion which we can neither describe nor conceive, predestinating [i.e., pre-planning] all things, formed them as He pleased, bestowing harmony on all things, and assigning them their own place, and the beginning of their creation. In this way He conferred on spiritual things a spiritual and invisible nature, on super-celestial things a celestial, on angels an angelical, on animals an animal [or, on souls, a soulish].
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.2, sec 4

{Jn 1:3; Ps 33:9; Ps 148:5}
5. For this is a peculiarity of the pre-eminence of God, not to stand in need of other instruments for the creation of those things which are summoned into existence. His own Word is both suitable and sufficient for the formation of all things, even as John, the disciple of the Lord, declares regarding Him: "All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made." Now, among the "all things" our world must be embraced. It too, therefore, was made by His Word, as Scripture tells us in the book of Genesis that He made all things connected with our world by His Word. David also expresses the same truth [when he says] "For He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created."

{Eph 4:6}
He [Moses] at first narrated the formation of the world in these words: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth," and all other things in succession; but neither gods nor angels [had any share in the work].

I have indeed proved already that there is only one God.   location 12193

{Free Will}
4. It is not seemly, however, to say of Him who is God over all, since He is free and independent, that He was a slave to necessity, or that anything takes place with His permission, yet against His desire; otherwise they will make necessity greater and more kingly than God, since that which has the most power is superior3012 to all [others]. And He ought at the very beginning to have cut off the causes of [the fancied] necessity, and not to have allowed Himself to be shut up to yielding to that necessity, by permitting anything besides that which became Him.

One God, the Maker of heaven and earth; others, again, after them, being reminded of this fact by the prophets of God, while the very heathen learned it from creation itself. For even creation reveals Him who formed it, and the very work made suggests Him who made it, and the world manifests Him who ordered it. The Universal Church, moreover, through the whole world, has received this tradition from the apostles.

{Apostles Creed; Father and Son; 1 Cor 8:6}
It is easy to prove from the very words of the Lord, that He acknowledges one Father and Creator of the world, and Fashioner of man, who was proclaimed by the Law and the Prophets, while He knows no other, and that this One is really God over all; and that He teaches that that adoption of sons pertaining to the Father, which is eternal life, takes place through Himself, conferring it [as He does] on all the righteous.

{Greek-Zoe}
For how can they separate the Propator from his Ennoea, or Nous from Aletheia, or Logos from Greek-Zoe, and so on with the rest?
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.12, sec 4

{Logos; Greek-Zoe; Jn 1:1; Father and Son}
For they maintain that Logos and Greek-Zoe were sent forth by him (i.e., Nous) as fashioners of this Pleroma; while they conceive of an emission of Logos, that is, the Word after the analogy of human feelings, and rashly form conjectures respecting God, as if they had discovered something wonderful in their assertion that Logos was I produced by Nous. All indeed have a clear perception that this may be logically affirmed with respect to men.3049 But in Him who is God over all, since He is all Nous, and all Logos, as I have said before, and has in Himself nothing more ancient or late than another, and nothing at variance with another, but continues altogether equal, and similar, and homogeneous, there is no longer ground for conceiving of such production in the order which has been mentioned. Just as he does not err who declares that God is all vision, and all hearing (for in what manner He sees, in that also He hears; and in what manner He hears, in that also He sees), so also he who affirms that He is all intelligence, and all word, and that, in whatever respect He is intelligence, in that also He is word, and that this Nous is His Logos, will still indeed have only an inadequate conception of the Father of all, but will entertain far more becoming [thoughts regarding Him] than do those who transfer the generation of the word to which men gave utterance to the eternal Word of God, assigning a beginning and course of production [to Him], even as they do to their own word. And in what respect will the Word of God-yea, rather God Himself, since He is the Word [or, since He is Word]-differ from the word of men, if He follows the same order and process of generation?
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.13, sec 8

{Greek-Zoe}
9. They have fallen into error, too, respecting Greek-Zoe, by maintaining that she was produced in the sixth place, when it behooved her to take precedence of all [the rest], since God is life, and incorruption, and truth. And these and such like attributes have not been produced according to a gradual scale of descent, but they are names of those perfections which always exist in God, so far as it is possible and proper for men to hear and to speak of God. For with the name of God the following words will harmonize: intelligence, word, life, incorruption, truth, wisdom, goodness, and such like.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.13, sec 9

{Greek Philosophy; Gnostics}
6. Again, as to the desire they [the Gnostics] exhibit to refer this whole universe to numbers, they have learned it from the Pythagoreans. For these were the first who set forth numbers as the initial principle of all things, and [described] that initial principle of theirs as being both equal and unequal, out of of all things which Plato supposed to have existed forever in the divine mind.
[FN: Our author's demonstration of the essential harmony of Gnosticism with the old mythologies, and the philosophies of the heathen, explains the hold it seems to have gained among nominal converts to Christianity, and also the necessity for a painstaking refutation of what seem to us mere absurdities. The great merit of Irenaeus is thus illustrated: he gave the death-blow to heathenism in extirpating heresy.]
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.14, sec 6

{Gnostics; 1 Tim 6:20}
Thus, then, by a complete perversion of language, they style ignorance of the truth knowledge: and Paul well says [of them,] that [they make use of] "novelties of words of false knowledge." For that knowledge of theirs is truly found to be false.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.14, sec 7
{Science}
3. The account which we give of creation is one harmonious with that regular order [of things prevailing in the world], for this scheme of ours is adapted to the things which have [actually] been made; but it is a matter of necessity that they, being unable to assign any reason belonging to the things themselves, with regard to those beings that existed before [creation], and were perfected by themselves, should fall into the greatest perplexity.

{Father and Son; Nicene Creed}
2. [Speaking to Valentinians:] I ask, then, in what manner were the rest of the Aeons produced? Was it so as to be united with Him who produced them, even as the solar rays are with the sun; or was it actually and separately, so that each of them possessed an independent existence and his own special form, just as has a man from another man, and one herd of cattle from another? Or was it after the manner of germination, as branches from a tree? And were they of the same substance with those who produced them, or did they derive their substance from some other [kind of] substance? Also, were they produced at the same time, so as to be contemporaries; or after a certain order, so that some of them were older, and others younger? And, again, are they uncompounded and uniform, and altogether equal and similar among themselves, as spirit and light are produced; or are they compounded and different, unlike [to each other] in their members?
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.17, sec 2 


{Father and Son; Nicene Creed}
4. If, again, the Aeons were derived from Logos, Logos from Nous, and Nous from Bythus, just as lights are kindled from a light-as, for example, torches are from a torch-then they may no doubt differ in generation and size from one another; but since they are of the same substance with the Author of their production, they must either all remain forever impassible, or their Father Himself must participate in passion. For the torch which has been kindled subsequently cannot be possessed of a different kind of light from that which preceded it. Wherefore also their lights, when blended in one, return to the original identity, since that one light is then formed which has existed even from the beginning. But we cannot speak, with respect to light itself, of some part being more recent in its origin, and another being more ancient (for the whole is but one light).
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.17, sec 4 

{Father and Son; Nicene Creed}
If the light of the Father is that from which all other lights have been formed, and which is by nature impassible . . . how can an Aeon be spoken of as either younger or older among themselves, since there is but one light in the entire Pleroma? And if anyone calls them stars, they will all nevertheless appear to participate in the same nature. For if "one star differs from another star in glory," but not in qualities, nor substance, nor in the fact of being passible or impassible; so all these, since they are alike derived from the light of the Father, must . . . be naturally impassible and immutable.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.17, sec 5 

{Father and Son}
7. If, again, they [the Valentinians] declare that their Aeons were sent forth just as rays are from the sun, then, since all are of the same substance and sprung from the same source, all must either be capable of passion along with Him who produced them, or all will remain impassible forever.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.17, sec 7 

{Father and Son}
It is altogether impossible in the case of the Logos of the Father. For if, existing in the Father, he knows Him in whom he exists-that is, is not ignorant of himself-then those productions which issue from him being his powers (faculties), and always present with him, will not be ignorant of him who emitted them, any more than rays [may be supposed to be] of the sun.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.17, sec 8 


{Name of God; Mt 6:9}
[Speaking to Valentinians:] And your Father is the cause of all this mischief; for you declare the magnitude and power of your Father to be the causes of ignorance, assimilating Him to Bythus, and assigning this as a name to Him who is the unnameable Father.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.17, sec 10 

{Sophia; Wisdom; Prov 8:22}
[FN: "Although Sophia was a feminine Aeon, she was regarded as being the father of Enthymesis." Me: This shows that although the word Sophia is feminine in declension, the person Sophia was regarded by the Valentinians as masculine, the same as Wisdom is Proverbs is regarded as being the Son.]

{Gnostics; 1 Cor 2:13-15}
3. [Referring to the Valentinians:] And that they are the truly "spiritual," inasmuch as a certain particle of the Father of the universe has been deposited in their souls, since, according to their assertions, they have souls formed of the same substance as the Demiurge himself, yet that he, although he received from the Mother, once for all, the whole [of the divine] seed, and possessed it in himself, still remained of an animal [soulish] nature, and had not the slightest understanding of those things which are above, which things they boast that they themselves understand, while they are still on earth;-does not this crown all possible absurdity?
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.19, sec 3 

{Atonement; Incarnation; 1 Cor 15:42-44}
Why, again, since it was of a spiritual nature, had it any need of descending into flesh? For what is carnal stands in need of that which is spiritual, if indeed it is to be saved, that in it it may be sanctified and cleared from all impurity, and that what is mortal may be swallowed up by immortality; but that which is spiritual has no need whatever of those things which are here below. For it is not we who benefit it, but it that improves us.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.2, ch.19, sec 6 

{1 Cor 1:26-28}
But since neither he [Herod], nor the chief priests, nor the rulers, nor the eminent of the people, turned to Him [in faith], but, on the contrary, those who sat begging by the highway, the deaf, and the blind, while He was rejected and despised by others, according to what Paul declares, "For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise men among you, not many noble, not many mighty; but those things of the world which were despised has God chosen."

{Atonement; Eph 4:8; Lk 10:19; Mk 16:17-18}
His passion gave rise to strength and power. For the Lord, through means of suffering, "ascending into the lofty place, led captivity captive, gave gifts to men," and conferred on those that believe in Him the power "to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy," that is, of the leader of apostasy. Our Lord also by His passion destroyed death, and dispersed error, and put an end to corruption, and destroyed ignorance, while He manifested life and revealed truth, and bestowed the gift of incorruption.

But Judas having been once for all cast away, never returns into the number of the disciples; otherwise a different person would not have been chosen to fill his place. . . . Judas was cast away, and Matthias was ordained instead of him.

{Isa 61:2; Rom 8:36}
2. That, then, was called the day of retribution on which the Lord will render to everyone according to his works-that is, the judgment. The acceptable year of the Lord, again, is this present time, in which those who believe Him are called by Him, and become acceptable to God-that is, the whole time from His advent onwards to the consummation [of all things], during which He acquires to Himself as fruits [of the scheme of mercy] those who are saved. For, according to the phraseology of the prophet, the day of retribution follows the [acceptable] year; and the prophet will be proved guilty of falsehood if the Lord preached only for a year, and if he speaks of it. For where is the day of retribution? For the year has passed, and the day of retribution has not yet come; but He still "makes His sun to rise upon the good and upon the evil, and sends rain upon the just and unjust." And the righteous suffer persecution, are afflicted, and are slain, while sinners are possessed of abundance, and "drink with the sound of the harp and psaltery, but do not regard the works of the Lord." But, according to the language [used by the prophet], they ought to be combined, and the day of retribution to follow the [acceptable] year. For the words are, "to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of retribution." This present time, therefore, in which men are called and saved by the Lord, is properly understood to be denoted by "the acceptable year of the Lord;" and there follows on this "the day of retribution," that is, the judgment. And the time thus referred to is not called "a year" only, but is also named "a day" both by the prophet and by Paul, of whom the apostle, calling to mind the Scripture, says in the Epistle addressed to the Romans, "As it is written, for your sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter." But here the expression "all the day long" is put for all this time during which we suffer persecution. As then this day does not signify one which consists of twelve hours, but the whole time during which believers in Christ suffer and are put to death for His sake, so also the year there mentioned does not denote one which consists of twelve months, but the whole time of faith during which men hear and believe the preaching of the Gospel, and those become acceptable to God who unite themselves to Him.     location 13225

3. They have not examined the Gospels to ascertain how often after His baptism the Lord went up, at the time of the Passover, to Jerusalem, in accordance with what was the practice of the Jews from every land, and every year, that they should assemble at this period in Jerusalem, and there celebrate the feast of the Passover. First of all, after He had made the water wine at Cana of Galilee, He went up to the festival day of the Passover, on which occasion it is written, "For many believed in Him, when they saw the signs which He did," as John the disciple of the Lord records. (Jn 2:11-13) Then, again, withdrawing Himself [from Judaea], He is found in Samaria; on which occasion, too, He conversed with the Samaritan woman, and while at a distance, cured the son of the centurion by a word, saying, "Go your way, your son lives." Afterwards He went up, the second time, to observe the festival day of the Passover in Jerusalem; on which occasion He cured the paralytic man, who had lain beside the pool thirty-eight years, bidding him rise, take up his couch, and depart. (Jn 5:1) Again, withdrawing from thence to the other side of the sea of Tiberias, He there seeing a great crowd had followed Him, fed all that multitude with five loaves of bread, and twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above. (Jn 6:1) Then, when He had raised Lazarus from the dead, and plots were formed against Him by the Pharisees, He withdrew to a city called Ephraim; and from that place, as it is written "He came to Bethany six days before the Passover," and going up from Bethany to Jerusalem, He there ate the Passover, and suffered on the day following. (Jn 11:54-55; 12:1)Now, that these three occasions of the Passover are not included within one year, every person whatever must acknowledge.   location 13240

Being a Master, therefore, He also possessed the age of a Master, not despising or evading any condition of humanity, nor setting aside in Himself that law which He had appointed for the human race, but sanctifying every age, by that period corresponding to it which belonged to Himself. For He came to save all through means of Himself-all, I say, who through Him are born again to God3134-infants,3135 and children, and boys, and youths, and old men. He therefore passed through every age, becoming an infant for infants, thus sanctifying infants; a child for children, thus sanctifying those who are of this age, being at the same time made to them an example of piety, righteousness, and submission; a youth for youths, becoming an example to youths, and thus sanctifying them for the Lord.    location 13254

Is it a meaningless and accidental thing, that the positions of names, and the election of the apostles, and the working of the Lord, and the arrangement of created things, are what they are?-we answer them: Certainly not; but with great wisdom and diligence, all things have clearly been made by God, fitted and prepared [for their special purposes]; and His word formed both things ancient and those belonging to the latest times; and men ought not to connect those things with the number thirty, but to harmonize them with what actually exists, or with right reason. Nor should they seek to prosecute inquiries respecting God by means of numbers, syllables, and letters. For this is an uncertain mode of proceeding, on account of their varied and diverse systems, and because every sort of hypothesis may at the present day be, in like manner, devised by anyone; so that they can derive arguments against the truth from these very theories, inasmuch as they may be turned in many different directions.

1. It is therefore better and more profitable to belong to the simple and unlettered class, and by means of love to attain to nearness to God, than, by imagining ourselves learned and skillful, to be found [among those who are] blasphemous against their own God, inasmuch as they conjure up another God as the Father. And for this reason Paul exclaimed, "Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies," not that he meant to inveigh against a true knowledge of God, for in that case he would have accused himself; but, because he knew that some, puffed up by the pretense of knowledge, fall away from the love of God . . .It is therefore better, as I have said, that one should have no knowledge whatever of anyone reason why a single thing in creation has been made, but should believe in God, and continue in His love, than that, puffed up through knowledge of this kind, he should fall away from that love which is the life of man; and that he should search after no other knowledge except [the knowledge of] Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was crucified for us, than that by subtle questions and hair-splitting expressions he should fall into impiety.   location 13459

These things are such as fall [plainly] under our observation, and are clearly and unambiguously in express terms set forth in the Sacred Scriptures. And therefore the parables ought not to be adapted to ambiguous expressions. For, if this be not done, both he who explains them will do so without danger, and the parables will receive a like interpretation from all, and the body of truth remains entire, with a harmonious adaptation of its members.

2. If, however, we cannot discover explanations of all those things in Scripture which are made the subject of investigation, yet let us not on that account seek after any other God besides Him who really exists. For this is the very greatest impiety. We should leave things of that nature to God who created us, being most properly assured that the Scriptures are indeed perfect, since they were spoken by the Word of God and His Spirit; but we, inasmuch as we are inferior to, and later in existence than, the Word of God and His Spirit, are on that very account destitute of the knowledge of His mysteries. And there is no cause for wonder if this is the case with us as respects things spiritual and heavenly, and such as require to be made known to us by revelation, since many even of those things which lie at our very feet (I mean such as belong to this world, which we handle, and see, and are in close contact with) transcend our knowledge, so that even these we must leave to God. . . . What as to the reason why the moon waxes and wanes, or what as to the cause of the difference of nature among various waters, metals, stones, and such like things?

As the apostle has said on this point, that, when other things have been done away, then these three, "faith, hope, and charity, shall endure." For faith, which has respect to our Master, endures unchangeably, assuring us that there is but one true God, and that we should truly love Him forever, seeing that He alone is our Father; while we hope ever to be receiving more and more from God, and to learn from Him, because He is good, and possesses boundless riches, a kingdom without end, and instruction that can never be exhausted. If, therefore, according to the rule which I have stated, we leave some questions in the hands of God, we shall both preserve our faith uninjured, and shall continue without danger; and all Scripture, which has been given to us by God, shall be found by us perfectly consistent; and the parables shall harmonize with those passages which are perfectly plain; and those statements the meaning of which is clear, shall serve to explain the parables; and through the many diversified utterances [of Scripture] there shall be heard one harmonious melody in us, praising in hymns that God who created all things. If, for instance, anyone asks, "What was God doing before He made the world?" we reply that the answer to such a question lies with God Himself.   location 13551

For consider, all you who invent such opinions, since the Father Himself is alone called God, who has a real existence, but whom you style the Demiurge; since, moreover, the Scriptures acknowledge Him alone as God; and yet again, since the Lord confesses Him alone as His own Father, and knows no other, as I shall show from His very words,-   location 13556

For there is among the Greeks one logos which is the principle that thinks, and another which is the instrument by means of which thought is expressed); and [to say] that a man sometimes is at rest and silent, while at other times he speaks and is active. But since God is all mind, all reason, all active spirit, all light, and always exists one and the same, as it is both beneficial for us to think of God, and as we learn regarding Him from the Scriptures, such feelings and divisions [of operation] cannot fittingly be ascribed to Him.. . . 5. But God being all Mind, and all Logos, both speaks exactly what He thinks, and thinks exactly what He speaks. For His thought is Logos, and Logos is Mind, and Mind comprehending all things is the Father Himself.   location 13566, 13572

[Addressed to the Valentinians]: He, therefore, who speaks of the mind of God, and ascribes to it a special origin of its own, declares Him a compound Being, as if God were one thing, and the original Mind another. So, again, with respect to Logos, when one attributes to him the third place of production from the Father; on which supposition he is ignorant of His greatness; and thus Logos has been far separated from God. As for the prophet, he declares respecting Him, "Who shall describe His generation?" But you pretend to set forth His generation from the Father, and you transfer the production of the word of men which takes place by means of a tongue to the Word of God, and thus are righteously exposed by your own selves as knowing neither things human nor divine.

Neither Valentinus, nor Marcion, nor Saturninus, nor Basilides, nor angels, nor archangels, nor principalities, nor powers [possess this knowledge], but the Father only who begot, and the Son who was begotten.

For "the Father," says He, "is greater than I."

For if it is on account of their nature that all souls attain to the place of enjoyment, and all belong to the intermediate place simply because they are souls, as being thus of the same nature with it, then it follows that faith is altogether superfluous, as was also the descent of the Savior. If, on the other hand, it is on account of their righteousness [that they attain to such a place of rest], then it is no longer because they are souls but because they are righteous.    location 13639

But since he (Paul) has described that assumption of himself up to the third heaven as something great and pre-eminent, it cannot be that these men ascend above the seventh heaven, for they are certainly not superior to the apostle. If they do maintain that they are more excellent than he, let them prove themselves so by their works, for they have never pretended to anything like [what he describes]. And for this reason he added, "Whether in the body, or whether out of the body, God knows," that the body might neither be thought to be a partaker in that vision, as if it could have participated in those things which it had seen and heard; nor, again, that anyone should say that he was not carried higher on account of the weight of the body; but it is therefore thus far permitted even without the body to behold spiritual mysteries which are the operations of God, who made the heavens and the earth, and formed man, and placed him in paradise, so that those should be spectators of them who, like the apostle, have reached a high degree of perfection in the love of God.

As I have shown by numerous arguments of the very clearest nature He (the Creator) made all things freely, and by His own power, and arranged and finished them, and His will is the substance of all things, then He is discovered to be the one only God who created all things, who alone is Omnipotent, and who is the only Father rounding and forming all things, visible and invisible, such as may be perceived by our senses and such as cannot, heavenly and earthly, "by the word of His power;" and He has fitted and arranged all things by His Wisdom, while He contains all things, but He Himself can be contained by no one: He is the Former, He the Builder, He the Discoverer, He the Creator, He the Lord of all; and there is no one besides Him, or above Him, neither has He any mother, as they [the Gnostics] falsely ascribe to Him; nor is there a second God, as Marcion has imagined. . .But there is one only God, the Creator-He who is above every Principality, and Power, and Dominion, and Virtue: He is Father, He is God, He the Founder, He the Maker, He the Creator, who made those things by Himself, that is, through His Word and His Wisdom-heaven and earth, and the seas, and all things that are in them: He is just; He is good; He it is who formed man, who planted paradise, who made the world, who gave rise to the flood, who saved Noah; He is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of the living: He it is whom the law proclaims, whom the prophets preach, whom Christ reveals, whom the apostles make known to us, and in whom the Church believes. He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: through His Word, who is His Son, through Him He is revealed and manifested to all to whom He is revealed; for those [only] know Him to whom the Son has revealed Him.

2. When they [the Gnostics] further maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience of every kind of work and conduct, so that, if it be possible, accomplishing all during one manifestation in this life, they may [at once] pass over to the state of perfection, they are, by no chance, found striving to do those things which wait upon virtue, and are laborious, glorious, and skillful, which also are approved universally as being good. For if it be necessary to go through every work and every kind of operation, they ought, in the first place, to learn all the arts: all of them, [I say,] whether referring to theory or practice, whether they be acquired by self-denial, or are mastered through means of labor, exercise, and perseverance; as, for example, every kind of music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and all such as are occupied with intellectual pursuits: then, again, the whole study of medicine, and the knowledge of plants, so as to become acquainted with those which are prepared for the health of man; the art of painting and sculpture, brass and marble work, and the kindred arts: moreover, [they have to study] every kind of country labor, the veterinary art, pastoral occupations, the various kinds of skilled labor, which are said to pervade the whole circle of [human] exertion; those, again, connected with a maritime life, gymnastic exercises, hunting, military and kingly pursuits, and as many others as may exist, of which, with the utmost labor, they could not learn the tenth, or even the thousandth part, in the whole course of their lives. The fact indeed is, that they endeavor to learn none of these, although they maintain that it is incumbent on them to have experience of every kind of work; but, turning aside to voluptuousness, and lust, and abominable actions, they stand self-condemned when they are tried by their own doctrine. For, since they are destitute of all those [virtues] which have been mentioned, they will [of necessity] pass into the destruction of fire.

It is not possible to name the number of the gifts which the Church, [scattered] throughout the whole world, has received from God, in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and which she exerts day by day for the benefit of the Gentiles, neither practicing deception upon any, nor taking any reward from them [on account of such miraculous interpositions].

For the body is not possessed of greater power than the soul, since indeed the former is inspired, and vivified, and increased, and held together by the latter; but the soul possesses and rules over the body. It is doubtless retarded in its velocity, just in the exact proportion in which the body shares in its motion; but it never loses the knowledge which properly belongs to it. For the body may be compared to an instrument; but the soul is possessed of the reason of an artist. . . . so also the soul, by being mixed up with the body belonging to it, is in a certain measure impeded, its rapidity being blended with the body's slowness. Yet it does not lose altogether its own peculiar powers; but while, as it were, sharing life with the body, it does not itself cease to live.   location 13921

For God is not so poor or destitute in resources, that He cannot confer its own proper soul on each individual body, even as He gives it also its special character. And therefore, when the number [fixed upon] is completed, [that number] which He had predetermined in His own counsel, all those who have been enrolled for life [eternal] shall rise again, having their own bodies, and having also their own souls, and their own spirits, in which they had pleased God. Those, on the other hand, who are worthy of punishment, shall go away into it, they too having their own souls and their own bodies, in which they stood apart from the grace of God. Both classes shall then cease from any longer begetting and being begotten, from marrying and being given in marriage; so that the number of mankind, corresponding to the fore-ordination of God, being completed, may fully realize the scheme formed by the Father.   location 13933

{Lk 16:19-31; Transmigration; Souls; Intermediate State}
1. The Lord has taught with very great fullness, that souls not only continue to exist, not by passing from body to body, but that they preserve the same form [in their separate state] as the body had to which they were adapted, and that they remember the deeds which they did in this state of existence, and from which they have now ceased,-in that narrative which is recorded respecting the rich man and that Lazarus who found repose in the bosom of Abraham. In this account He states that the rich man knew Lazarus after death, and Abraham in like manner, and that each one of these persons continued in his own proper position, and that he requested Lazarus to be sent to relieve him-[Lazarus], on whom he did not [formerly] bestow even the crumbs from his table. [He tells us] also of the answer given by Abraham, who was acquainted not only with what respected himself, but the rich man also, and who enjoined those who did not wish to come into that place of torment to believe Moses and the Prophets, and to receive the preaching of Him who was to rise again from the dead. By these things, then, it is plainly declared that souls continue to exist that they do not pass from body to body, that they possess the form of a man, so that they may be recognized, and retain the memory of things in this world; moreover, that the gift of prophecy was possessed by Abraham, and that each class [of souls] receives a habitation such as it has deserved, even before the judgment.  location 13942

But all things which proceed from Him, whatsoever have been made, and are made, do indeed receive their own beginning of generation, and on this account are inferior to Him who formed them, inasmuch as they are not unbegotten. Nevertheless they endure, and extend their existence into a long series of ages in accordance with the will of God their Creator; so that He grants them that they should be thus formed at the beginning, and that they should so exist afterwards. location 13952

3. For as the heaven which is above us, . . . although they had no previous existence, were called into being, and continue throughout a long course of time according to the will of God, so also anyone who thinks thus respecting souls and spirits, and, in fact, respecting all created things, will not by any means go far astray, inasmuch as all things that have been made had a beginning when they were formed, but endure as long as God wills that they should have an existence and continuance. The prophetic Spirit bears testimony to these opinions, when He declares, "For He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created: He has established them forever, yea, forever and ever." And again, He thus speaks respecting the salvation of man: "He asked life of you, and you gave him length of days forever and ever;" indicating that it is the Father of all who imparts continuance forever and ever on those who are saved. For life does not arise from us, nor from our own nature; but it is bestowed according to the grace of God. And therefore he who shall preserve the life bestowed upon him, and give thanks to Him who imparted it, shall receive also length of days forever and ever. But he who shall reject it, and prove himself ungrateful to his Maker, inasmuch as he has been created, and has not recognized Him who bestowed [the gift upon him], deprives himself of [the privilege of] continuance forever and ever. And, for this reason, the Lord declared to those who showed themselves ungrateful towards Him: "If you have not been faithful in that which is little, who will give you that which is great?" indicating that those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves ungrateful to Him who bestowed it, shall justly not receive from Him length of days forever and ever.

4. But as the soulish body is certainly not itself the soul, yet has fellowship with the soul as long as God pleases; so the soul herself is not life, but partakes in that life bestowed upon her by God. Wherefore also the prophetic word declares of the first-formed man, "He became a living soul," teaching us that by the participation of life the soul became alive; so that the soul, and the life which it possesses, must be understood as being separate existences. When God therefore bestows life and perpetual duration, it comes to pass that even souls which did not previously exist should henceforth endure, since God has both willed that they should exist, and should continue in existence.   location 13974

Call to mind then, the things which I have stated in the two preceding books, and, taking these in connection with them, you shall have from me a very copious refutation of all the heretics; and faithfully and strenuously shall you resist them in defense of the only true and life-giving faith, which the Church has received from the apostles and imparted to her sons. For the Lord of all gave to His apostles the power of the Gospel, through whom also we have known the truth, that is, the doctrine of the Son of God; to whom also did the Lord declare: "He that hears you, hears Me; and he that despises you, despises Me, and Him who sent Me." location 14026

{1 Tim 3:15; Acts 1:8; Mt 28:19-20; Mk 16:20; Twelve; 1 Tim 6:20; Gnostics; 2 Tim 2:2}
1. We have learned from none others the plan of our salvation, than from those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did at one time proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of God, handed down to us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar of our faith. For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before they possessed "perfect knowledge," as some do even venture to say, boasting themselves as improvers of the apostles. For, after our Lord rose from the dead, [the apostles] were invested with power from on high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them], were filled from all [His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to the ends of the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do all equally and individually possess the Gospel of God.

{New Testament Canon; Preface to Matthew; Preface to Romans; Preface to Mark; Preface to Luke; Preface to John; Preface to Ephesians; Rev 2:1-4}
Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews3310 in their own dialect, while Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his residence at Ephesus in Asia.   location 14037

1. When, however, they are confuted from the Scriptures, they turn round and accuse these same Scriptures, as if they were not correct, nor of authority, and [assert] that they are ambiguous, and that the truth cannot be extracted from them by those who are ignorant of tradition. For [they allege] that the truth was not delivered by means of written documents, but vivâ voce: wherefore also Paul declared, "But we speak wisdom among those that are perfect, but not the wisdom of this world." And this wisdom each one of them alleges to be the fiction of his own inventing. . . . 2. But, again, when we refer them to that tradition which originates from the apostles, [and] which is preserved by means of the succession of presbyters in the churches, they object to tradition, saying that they themselves are wiser not merely than the presbyters, but even than the apostles, because they have discovered the unadulterated truth. For [they maintain] that the apostles intermingled the things of the Law with the words of the Savior.     location 14046

1. It is within the power of all, therefore, in every church, who may wish to see the truth, to contemplate clearly the tradition of the apostles manifested throughout the whole world; and we are in a position to reckon up those who were by the apostles instituted bishops in the churches, and [to demonstrate] the succession of these men to our own times; those who neither taught nor knew of anything like what these [heretics] rave about. For if the apostles had known hidden mysteries, which they were in the habit of imparting to "the perfect" apart and privily from the rest, they would have delivered them especially to those to whom they were also committing the churches themselves. For they were desirous that these men should be very perfect and blameless in all things, whom also they were leaving behind as their successors, delivering up their own place of government to these men; which men, if they discharged their functions honestly, would be a great boon [to the church], but if they should fall away, the direst calamity.   location 14065

{Apostolic Succession; Preface to Romans; 2 Tim 2:2; 2 Thess 2:15}
2. Since, however, it would be very tedious, in such a volume as this, to reckon up the successions of all the churches, we do put to confusion all those who, in whatever manner, whether by an evil self-pleasing, by vainglory, or by blindness and perverse opinion, assemble in unauthorized meetings; [we do this, I say,] by indicating that tradition derived from the apostles, of the very great, the very ancient, and universally known church founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul; as also [by pointing out] the faith preached to men, which comes down 686  to our time by means of the successions of the bishops. For it is a matter of necessity that every church should agree with this church, on account of its pre-eminent authority, that is, the faithful everywhere, inasmuch as the apostolic tradition has been preserved continuously by those [faithful men] who exist everywhere.   location 14074

{2 Tim 4:21; Phil 4:3; Clement of Rome; Preface to Romans; 2 Tim 2:2; Preface to ECSB; Preface to 1 Cor}
3. The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church, committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of this Linus, Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy. To him succeeded Anacletus; and after him, in the third place from the apostles, Clement was allotted the bishopric. This man, as he had seen the blessed apostles, and had been conversant with them, might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes. Nor was he alone [in this], for there were many still remaining who had received instructions from the apostles. In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren at Corinth, the church in Rome dispatched a most powerful letter to the Corinthians, exhorting them to peace, renewing their faith, and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the apostles, proclaiming the one God, omnipotent, the Maker of heaven and earth, the Creator of man, who brought on the deluge, and called Abraham, who led the people from the land of Egypt, spoke with Moses, set forth the law, sent the prophets, and who has prepared fire for the devil and his angels. From this document, whosoever chooses to do so, may learn that He, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was preached by the churches, and may also understand the apostolic tradition of the church, since this epistle is of older date than these men who are now propagating falsehood, and who conjure into existence another god beyond the Creator and the Maker of all existing things. To this Clement there succeeded Evaristus.   location 14088
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.3, ch.3, par 3

{Apostolic Succession; 2 Tim 2:2; Jude 3; Eph 4:5; Preface to ECSB}
Alexander followed Evaristus; then, sixth from the apostles, Sixtus was appointed; after him, Telesphorus, who was gloriously martyred; then Hyginus; after him, Pius; then after him, Anicetus. Soter having succeeded Anicetus, Eleutherius does now, in the twelfth place from the apostles, hold the inheritance of the episcopate. In this order, and by this succession, the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles, and the preaching of the truth, have come down to us. And this is most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith, which has been preserved in the Church from the apostles until now, and handed down in truth.   location 14093

{Polycarp; Acts 2:42; 2 Thess 2:15; 2 Tim 2:2; Jude 3}
4. But Polycarp also was not only instructed by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ, but was also, by apostles in Asia, appointed bishop of the Church in Smyrna, whom I also saw in my early youth, for he tarried [on earth] a very long time, and, when a very old man, gloriously and most nobly suffering martyrdom, departed this life, having always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles, and which the Church has handed down, and which alone are true. . . .

There are also those who heard from Him who John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed out of the bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, "Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within."   location 14101

{Rev 22:17; 2 Tim 2:2; 1 Tim 3:15}
1. Since therefore we have such proofs, it is not necessary to seek the truth among others which it is easy to obtain from the Church; since the apostles, like a rich man [depositing his money] in a bank, lodged in her hands most copiously all things pertaining to the truth: so that every man, whosoever will, can draw from her the water of life.   location 14112

Suppose there arise a dispute relative to some important question among us, should we not have recourse to the most ancient Churches with which the apostles held constant intercourse, and learn from them what is certain and clear in regard to the present question? . . . For how should it be if the apostles themselves had not left us writings? Would it not be necessary, [in that case,] to follow the course of the tradition which they handed down to those to whom they did commit the Churches?   location 14117

2. To which course many nations of those barbarians who believe in Christ do assent, having salvation written in their hearts by the Spirit, without paper or ink, and, carefully preserving the ancient tradition, believing in one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and all things therein, by means of Christ Jesus, the Son of God; who, because of His surpassing love towards His creation, condescended to be born of the virgin, He Himself uniting man through Himself to God, and having suffered under Pontius Pilate, and rising again, and having been received up in splendor, shall come in glory, the Savior of those who are saved, and the Judge of those who are judged, and sending into eternal fire those who transform the truth, and despise His Father and His advent.   location 14119

Those who, in the absence of written documents, have believed this faith, are barbarians, so far as regards our language; but as regards doctrine, manner, and tenor of life, they are, because of faith, very wise indeed; and they do please God, ordering their conversation in all righteousness, chastity, and wisdom.   location 14125

{Marcion; Jude 3-4; Valentinus; 2 Tim 2:2; 2 Thess 2:15}
3. For, prior to Valentinus, those who follow Valentinus had no existence; nor did those from Marcion exist before Marcion; nor, in short, had any of those malignant-minded people, whom I have above enumerated, any being previous to the initiators and inventors of their perversity.   location 14130

For Valentinus came to Rome in the time of Hyginus, flourished under Pius, and remained until Anicetus. Cerdon, too, Marcion's predecessor, himself arrived in the time of Hyginus, who was the ninth bishop. . . .

He shall also descend from heaven in His Father's power, and pass judgment upon all, and who shall freely give the good things of God to those who shall have kept His commandments. He, appearing in these last times, the chief cornerstone, has gathered into one, and united those that were far off and those that were near; that is, the circumcision and the uncircumcision, enlarging Japheth, and placing him in the dwelling of Shem.

1. Therefore neither would the Lord, nor the Holy Spirit, nor the apostles, have ever named as God, definitely and absolutely, him who was not God, unless he were truly God; nor would they have named anyone in his own person Lord, except God the Father ruling over all, and His Son who has received dominion from His Father over all creation, as this passage has it: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." . . .

And again, referring to the destruction of the Sodomites, the Scripture says, "Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven."

The same truth: "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of your kingdom is a right scepter. You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, your God, has anointed You." For the Spirit designates both [of them] by the name, of God-both Him who is anointed as Son, and Him who does anoint, that is, the Father. And again: "God stood in the congregation of the gods, He judges among the gods." He [here] refers to the Father and the Son, and those who have received the adoption; but these are the Church. For she is the synagogue [assembly] of God, which God-that is, the Son Himself-has gathered by Himself.   location 14185

Of whom [Christ] He again speaks: "The God of gods, the Lord has spoken, and has called the earth." Who is meant by God? He of whom He has said, "God shall come openly, our God, and shall not keep silence;" that is, the Son, who came manifested to men who said, "I have openly appeared to those who seek me not." But of what gods [does he speak]? [Of those] to whom He says, "I have said, you are gods, and all sons of the Most High." To those, no doubt, who have received the grace of the "adoption, by which we cry, Abba Father."  . . .  2. Wherefore, as I have already stated, no other is named as God, or is called Lord, except Him who is God and Lord of all, who also said to Moses, "I am that I am." [Note: this is from Latin trans., in which most of Irenaeus has survived. The LXX says, "I am the existing One."]  . . . And thus shall you say to the children of Israel: He who is, has sent me unto you;" and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who makes those that believe in His name the sons of God.   location 14195

{2 Cor 4:4; Paul's Writing Style}
1. For if anyone reads the passage thus-according to Paul's custom, as I show elsewhere, and by many examples, that he uses transposition of words-"In whom God," then pointing it off, and making a slight interval, and at the same time read also the rest [of the sentence] in one [clause], "has blinded the minds of them of this world that believe not," he shall find out the true [sense]; that it is contained in the expression, "God has blinded the minds of the unbelievers of this world."  . . . And this is shown by means of the little interval [between the clause]. For Paul does not say, "the God of this world," as if recognizing any other beyond Him; but he confessed God as indeed God. And he says, "the unbelievers of this world," because they shall not inherit the future age of incorruption.   location 14240
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.3, ch.7

{Gal 3:19; Paul's Writing Style}
2. From many other instances also, we may discover that the apostle frequently uses a transposed order in his sentences, due to the rapidity of his discourses, and the impetus of the Spirit which is in him. An example occurs in the [Epistle] to the Galatians, where he expresses himself as follows: "Wherefore then the Law of works? It was added, until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator." For the order of the words runs thus: "Wherefore then the Law of works? Ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator, it was added until the seed should come to whom the promise was made,"-man thus asking the question, and the Spirit making answer.   location 14244

{2 Thess 2:8; Paul's Writing Style}
2. From many other instances also, we may discover that the apostle frequently uses a transposed order in his sentences, due to the rapidity of his discourses, and the impetus of the Spirit which is in him. An example occurs in the [Epistle] to the Galatians. . . .  And again, in the Parond to the Thessalonians, speaking of Antichrist, he says, "And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus Christ shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy him with the presence of his coming; [even him] whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders." Now in these [sentences] the order of the words is this: "And then shall be revealed that wicked, whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the Spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the presence of His coming." For he does not mean that the coming of the Lord is after the working of Satan; but the coming of the wicked one, whom we also call Antichrist. . . . If, then, one does not attend to the [proper] reading [of the passage], and if he do not exhibit the intervals of breathing as they occur, there shall be not only incongruities, but also, when reading, he will utter blasphemy, as if the advent of the Lord could take place according to the working of Satan.   location 14255
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk.3, ch.7

{2 Cor 4:4}
So therefore, in such passages, the hyperbaton must be exhibited by the reading, and the apostle's meaning following on, preserved; and thus we do not read in that passage, "the god of this world," but, "God," whom we do truly call God; and we hear [it declared of] the unbelieving and the blinded of this world, that they shall not inherit the world of life which is to come.   location 14257

{Mt 6:24; Samaritans; Aramaic}
For mammon is, according to the Jewish language, which the Samaritans do also use, a covetous man, and one who wishes to have more than he ought to have.

Now we were the vessels and the house of this [strong man] when we were in a state of apostasy. . . . For he was not strong, as opposed to Him who bound him, and spoiled his house; but as against those persons who were his tools, inasmuch as he caused their thought to wander away from God: these did the Lord snatch from his grasp.  . . .

For inasmuch as the Word of God was man from the root of Jesse, and son of Abraham, in this respect did the Spirit of God rest upon Him, and anoint Him to preach the Gospel to the lowly. But inasmuch as He was God, He did not judge according to glory*, nor reprove after the manner of speech. For "He needed not that any should testify to Him of man,3391 for He Himself knew what was in man."3392 For He called all men that mourn; and granting forgiveness to those who had been led into captivity by their sins, He loosed them from their chains, of whom Solomon says, "Everyone shall be holden with the cords of his own sins."3393 Therefore did the Spirit of God descend upon Him, [the Spirit] of Him who had promised by the prophets that He would anoint Him, so that we, receiving from the abundance of His anointing, might be saved. location 14337

Those, again, who separate Jesus from Christ, alleging that Christ remained impassible, but that it was Jesus who suffered, preferring the Gospel by Mark, if they read it with a love of truth, may have their errors rectified.

8. It is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the Church is scattered throughout all the world, and the "pillar and ground" of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh. . . . He who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit. . . . As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, "You He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all things, He who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, "You that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth."3451 For the cherubim, too, were four-faced, and their faces were images of the dispensation of the Son of God. For, [as the Scripture] says, "The first living creature was like a lion,"3452 symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power; the parond [living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but "the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,"-an evident description of His advent as a human being; "the fourth was like a flying eagle," pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the church. And therefore the Gospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is seated. For that according to John relates His original, effectual, and glorious generation from the Father, thus declaring, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." . . . But that according to Luke, taking up [His] priestly character, commenced with Zacharias the priest offering sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be immolated for the finding again of the younger son. ... Matthew, again, relates His generation as a man. . . . This, then, is the Gospel of His humanity; for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a humble and meek man is kept up through the whole Gospel. ... Mark, on the other hand, commences with [a reference to] the prophetical spirit coming down from on high to men, saying, "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Esaias the prophet,"-pointing to the winged aspect of the Gospel; and on this account he made a compendious and cursory narrative, for such is the prophetical character. . . . Being made man for us, He sent the gift of the celestial Spirit over all the earth, protecting us with His wings. Such, then, as was the course followed by the Son of God, so was also the form of the living creatures; and such as was the form of the living creatures, so was also the character of the Gospel.3459 For the living creatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform.  location 14527

{Covenants, Two; Abraham}
* A portion of the Greek has been preserved here, but it differs materially from the old Latin version, which seems to represent the original with greater exactness, and has therefore been followed. The Greek represents the first covenant as having been given to Noah, at the deluge, under the sign of the rainbow; the parond as that given to Abraham, under the sign of circumcision; the third, as being the giving of the law, under Moses; and the fourth, as that of the Gospel, through our Lord Jesus Christ. [Paradise with the tree of life, Adam with Shechinah (Gen. iii. 24, Gen. iv. 16), Noah with the rainbow, Abraham with circumcision, Moses with the ark, Messiah with the sacraments, and heaven with the river of life, seem the complete system.]
For this reason were four principal (katholikai) covenants given to the human race*: one, prior to the deluge, under Adam; the parond, that after the deluge, under Noah; the third, the giving of the Law, under Moses; the fourth, that which renovates man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the Gospel, raising and bearing men upon its wings into the heavenly kingdom.   location 14529

Others, again (the Montanists), that they may set at nought the gift of the Spirit, which in the latter times has been, by the good pleasure of the Father, poured out upon the human race, do not admit that aspect presented by John's Gospel, in which the Lord promised that He would send the Paraclete; but set aside at once both the Gospel and the prophetic Spirit. Wretched men indeed! who wish to be pseudo-prophets, in fact, but who set aside the gift of prophecy from the Church. . . . We must conclude, moreover, that these men can not admit the Apostle Paul either. For, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, he speaks expressly of prophetical gifts, and recognizes men and women prophesying in the Church.   location 14540

1. The Apostle Peter, therefore, after the resurrection of the Lord, and His assumption into the heavens, being desirous of filling up the number of the twelve apostles, and in electing into the place of Judas any substitute who should be chosen by God, thus addressed those who were present: "Men [and] brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of David, spoke before concerning Judas, which was made guide to them that took Jesus. 430 For he was numbered with us:3466 . . . Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein;3467 and, His bishopric let another take;"3468-thus leading to the completion of the apostles, according to the words spoken by David.

But it is evident from Peter's words that he did indeed still retain the God who was already known to them; but he also bore witness to them that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, the Judge of quick and dead.

And the apostles who were with James allowed the Gentiles to act freely, yielding us up to the Spirit of God. But they themselves, while knowing the same God, continued in the ancient observances; so that even Peter, fearing also lest he might incur their reproof, although formerly eating with the Gentiles, because of the vision, and of the Spirit who had rested upon them, yet, when certain persons came from James, withdrew himself, and did not eat with them. And Paul said that Barnabas likewise did the same thing. Thus did the apostles, whom the Lord made witnesses of every action and of every doctrine-for upon all occasions do we find Peter, and James, and John present with Him-scrupulously act according to the dispensation of the Law, Mosaic, showing that it was from one and the same God; which they certainly never would have done, as I have already said, if they had learned from the Lord [that there existed] another Father besides Him who appointed the dispensation of the law.  location 14785

{Marcion; Reformation Doctrine}
1. With regard to those (the Marcionites) who allege that Paul alone knew the truth, and that to him the mystery was manifested by revelation. . . . Peter, therefore, was an apostle of that very God whose was also Paul; and Him whom Peter preached as God among those of the circumcision, and likewise the Son of God, did Paul [declare] also among the Gentiles. For our Lord never came to save Paul alone, nor is God so limited in means, that He should have but one apostle who knew the dispensation of His Son.

{Gal 2:1-2; Acts 15:1-2; Preface to Galatians}
3. But that Paul acceded to [the request of] those who summoned him to the apostles, on account of the question [which had been raised], and went up to them, with Barnabas, to Jerusalem, not without reason, but that the liberty of the Gentiles might be confirmed by them, he does himself say, in the Epistle to the Galatians: "Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking also Titus. But I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that Gospel which I preached among the Gentiles."  . . . If, then, anyone shall, from the Acts of the Apostles, carefully scrutinize the time concerning which it is written that he went up to Jerusalem on account of the aforementioned question, he will find those years mentioned by Paul coinciding with it. Thus the statement of Paul harmonizes with, and is, as it were, identical with, the testimony of Luke regarding the apostles.   location 14811

{Preface to Acts; Preface to Luke; 2 Tim 4:10-11; Gnostics}
1. But that this Luke was inseparable from Paul, and his fellow-laborer in the Gospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as bound to do so by the truth itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who was called Mark, had parted company from Paul, and sailed to Cyprus, "we came to Troas;"3539 and when Paul had beheld in a dream a man of Macedonia, saying, "Come into Macedonia, Paul, and help us," "immediately," he says, "we endeavored to go into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel unto them. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we directed our ship's course towards Samothracia." And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their journey as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address: "for, sitting down," he says, "we spoke unto the women who had assembled;"3540 and certain believed, even a great many. And again does he say, "But we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to Troas, where we abode seven days."3541 . . .  That he was not merely a follower, but also a fellow-laborer of the apostles, but especially of Paul, Paul has himself declared also in the Epistles, saying: "Demas has forsaken me, . . . and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me."  From this he shows that he was always attached to and inseparable from him. And again he says, in the Epistle to the Colossians: "Luke, the beloved physician, greets you."3546 But surely if Luke, who always preached in company with Paul, and is called by him "the beloved," and with him performed the work of an evangelist, and was entrusted to hand down to us a Gospel, learned nothing different from him (Paul), as has been pointed out from his words, how can these men, who were never attached to Paul, boast that they have learned hidden and unspeakable mysteries?

{Apostolic Tradition; Acts 20:20; Lk 1:2}
2. But that Paul taught with simplicity what he knew, not only to those who were [employed] with him, but to those that heard him, he does himself make manifest. For when the bishops and presbyters who came from Ephesus and the other cities adjoining had assembled in Miletus, since he was himself hastening to Jerusalem to observe Pentecost, after testifying many things to them, and declaring what must happen to him at Jerusalem, he added: "I know that you shall see my face no more. Therefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take heed, therefore, both to yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has placed you as bishops, to rule the church of the Lord,3547 which He has acquired for Himself through His own blood."3548 Then, referring to the evil teachers who should arise, he said: "I know that after my departure shall grievous wolves come to you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them." "I have not shunned," he says, "to declare unto you all the counsel of God." Thus did the apostles simply, and without respect of persons, deliver to all what they had themselves learned from the Lord. Thus also does Luke, without respect of persons, deliver to us what he had learned from them, as he has himself testified, saying, "Even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word."3549

{Gospel, Meaning of the Term; Preface to Luke}
3. Now if any man set Luke aside, as one who did not know the truth, he will, [by so acting,] manifestly reject that Gospel of which he claims to be a disciple. For through him we have become acquainted with very many and important parts of the Gospel; for instance, the generation of John, the history of Zacharias, the coming of the angel to Mary, the exclamation of Elisabeth, the descent of the angels to the shepherds, the words spoken by them, the testimony of Anna and of Simeon with regard to Christ, and that twelve years of age He was left behind at Jerusalem; also the baptism of John, the number of the Lord's years when He was baptized, and that this occurred in the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar. And in His office of teacher this is what He has said to the rich: "Woe unto you that are rich, for you have received your consolation;"3550 and "Woe unto you that are full, for you shall hunger; and you who laugh now, for you shall weep;" and, "Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you: for so did your fathers to the false prophets." All things of the following kind we have known through Luke alone (and numerous actions of the Lord we have learned through him, which also all [the Evangelists] notice): the multitude of fishes which Peter's companions enclosed, when at the Lord's command they cast the nets;3551 the woman who had suffered for eighteen years, and was healed on the Sabbath-day;3552 the man who had the dropsy, whom the Lord made whole on the Sabbath, and how He did defend Himself for having performed an act of healing on that day; how He taught His disciples not to aspire to the uppermost rooms; how we should invite the poor and feeble, who cannot recompense us; the man who knocked during the night to obtain loaves, and did obtain them, because of the urgency of his importunity; how, when [our Lord] was sitting at meat with a Pharisee, a woman that was a sinner kissed His feet, and anointed them with ointment, with what the Lord said to Simon on her behalf concerning the two debtors; also about the parable of that rich man who stored up the goods which had accrued to him, to whom it was also said, "In this night they shall demand your soul from you; whose then shall those things be which you have prepared?" and similar to this, that of the rich man, who was clothed in purple and who fared sumptuously, and the indigent Lazarus; also the answer which He gave to His disciples when they said, "Increase our faith;" also His conversation with Zaccheus the publican; also about the Pharisee and the publican, who were praying in the temple at the same time; also the ten lepers, whom He cleansed in the way simultaneously; also how He ordered the lame and the blind to be gathered to the wedding from the lanes and streets; also the parable of the judge who feared not God, whom the widow's importunity led to avenge her cause; and about the fig-tree in the vineyard which produced no fruit. There are also many other particulars to be found mentioned by Luke alone, which are made use of by both Marcion and Valentinus. And besides all these, [he records] what [Christ] said to His disciples in the way, after the resurrection, and how they recognized Him in the breaking of bread.   location 14858

4. For no persons of common sense can permit them to receive some things recounted by Luke as being true, and to set others aside, as if he had not known the truth. And if indeed Marcion's followers reject these, they will then possess no Gospel; for, curtailing that according to Luke, as I have said already, they boast in having the Gospel [in what remains].

{Ebionites; Preface to Luke; Preface to Acts; 1 Cor 9:1-2}

But again, we allege the same against those [i.e., the Ebionites] who do not recognize Paul as an apostle: that they should either reject the other words of the Gospel which we have come to know through Luke alone, and not make use of them; or else, if they do receive all these, they must necessarily admit also that testimony concerning Paul, when he (Luke) tells us that the Lord spoke at first to him from heaven: "Saul, Saul, why do you perparute Me?" . . . For neither can they contend that Paul was no apostle, when he was chosen for this purpose; nor can they prove Luke guilty of falsehood, when he proclaims the truth to us with all diligence. It may be, indeed, that it was with this view that God set forth very many Gospel truths, through Luke's instrumentality, which all should esteem it necessary to use.   location 14883

{Gnostics; Jn 20:31; 1 Jn 2:18-19}
The Gospel, therefore, knew no other son of man but Him who was of Mary, who also suffered; and no Christ who flew away from Jesus before the passion; but Him who was born it knew as Jesus Christ the Son of God, and that this same suffered and rose again, as John, the disciple of the Lord, verifies, saying: "But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have eternal life in His name,"3595-foreseeing these blasphemous systems which divide the Lord, as far as lies in their power, saying that He was formed of two different substances. For this reason also he has thus testified to us in his Epistle: "Little children, it is the last time; and as you have heard that Antichrist does come, now have many antichrists appeared; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but [they departed], that they might be made manifest that they are not of us. Know you therefore, that every lie is from without, and is not of the truth. Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist."3596

{Gnostics}
They [the Gnostics] argue, that he who proceeded from the Demiurge, or he who was dispensational, or he who sprang from Joseph, was the being subject to suffering; but upon the latter there descended from the invisible and ineffable [places] the Former, whom they assert to be incomprehensible, invisible, and impassible: they thus wander from the truth.

There is therefore, as I have pointed out, one God the Father, and one Christ Jesus, who came by means of the whole dispensational arrangements [connected with Him], 443 and gathered together all things in Himself.3598 But in every respect, too, He is man, the formation of God; and thus He took up man into Himself, the invisible becoming visible, the incomprehensible being made comprehensible, the impassible becoming capable of suffering, and the Word being made man, thus summing up all things in Himself: so that as in super-celestial, spiritual, and invisible things, the Word of God is supreme, so also in things visible and corporeal He might possess the supremacy, and, taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as constituting Himself Head of the church, He might draw all things to Himself at the proper time.

7. With Him is nothing incomplete or out of due season, just as with the Father there is nothing incongruous. For all these things were foreknown by the Father; but the Son works them out at the proper time in perfect order and sequence. This was the reason why, when Mary was urging [Him] on to [perform] the wonderful miracle of the wine, and was desirous before the time to partake of the cup of emblematic significance,* the Lord, checking her untimely haste, said, "Woman, what have I to do with you? mine hour is not yet come"-waiting for that hour which was foreknown by the Father.   location 15012

This is also the reason why, when men were often desirous to take Him, it is said, "No man laid hands upon Him, for the hour of His being taken was not yet come;" nor the time of His passion, which had been foreknown by the Father; as also says the prophet Habakkuk, "By this you shall be known when the years have drawn nigh; you shall be set forth when the time comes; because my soul is disturbed by anger, you shall remember your mercy." Paul also says: "But when the fullness of time came, God sent forth His Son."3603 By which is made manifest, that all things which had been foreknown of the Father, our Lord did accomplish in their order, season, and hour, foreknown and fitting, being indeed one and the same, but rich and great.    location 15015

Such men are to outward appearance sheep; for they appear to be like us, by what they say in public, repeating the same words as we do; but inwardly they are wolves. Their doctrine is homicidal, conjuring up, as it does, a number of gods, and simulating many Fathers, but lowering and dividing the Son of God in many ways. . . . These are they against whom the Lord has cautioned us beforehand; and His disciple, in his Epistle already mentioned, commands us to avoid them, when he says: "For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. Take heed to them, that you lose not what you have wrought."3604 And again does he say in the Epistle: "Many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God; and every spirit which separates Jesus Christ is not of God, but is of antichrist."3605

For I have shown that the Son of God did not then begin to exist, being with the Father from the beginning; but when He became incarnate, and was made man, He commenced afresh3633 the long line of human beings, and furnished us, in a brief, comprehensive manner, with salvation; so that what we had lost in Adam-namely, to be according to the image and likeness of God-that we might recover in Christ Jesus. 2. For as it was not possible that the man who had once for all been conquered, and who had been destroyed through disobedience, could reform himself, and obtain the prize of victory; and as it was also impossible that he could attain to salvation who had fallen under the power of sin,-the Son effected both these things, being the Word of God, descending from the Father, becoming incarnate, stooping low, even to death, and consummating the arranged plan of our salvation, upon whom [Paul], exhorting us unhesitatingly to believe, again says, "Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring down Christ; or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to liberate Christ again from the dead."3634 Then he continues, "If you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved."3635 And he renders the reason why the Son of God did these things, saying, "For to this end Christ both lived, and died, and revived, that He might rule over the living and the dead."

The Word of God the Father having been made the Son of man. For He fought and conquered; for He was man contending for the 448 fathers,3659 and through obedience doing away with disobedience completely: for He bound the strong man,3660 and set free the weak, and endowed His own handiwork with salvation, by destroying sin. For He is a most holy and merciful Lord, and loves the human race.   7. Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man (human nature) to cleave to and to become, one with God. For unless man had overcome the enemy of man, the enemy would not have been legitimately vanquished. And again: unless it had been God who had freely given salvation, we could never have possessed it parurely. And unless man had been joined to God, he could never have become a partaker of incorruptibility. For it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God and men, by His relationship to both, to bring both to friendship and concord, and present man to God, while He revealed God to man.3661 For, in what way could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had received from Him through the Son that fellowship which refers to Himself, unless His Word, having been made flesh, had entered into communion with us? Wherefore also He passed through every stage of life, restoring to all communion with God. Those, therefore, who assert that He appeared putatively, and was neither born in the flesh nor truly made man, are as yet under the old condemnation, holding out patronage to sin; for, by their showing, death has not been vanquished, which "reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression."3662 But the law coming, which was given by Moses, and testifying of sin that it is a sinner, did truly take away his [Satan's? or sin's?] kingdom, showing that he was no king, but a robber; and it revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however, a weighty burden upon man, who had sin in himself, showing that he was liable to death. For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man. For it behooved Him who was to destroy sin, and redeem man under the power of death, that He should Himself be made that very same thing which he was, that is, man; who had been drawn by sin into bondage, but was held by death, so that sin should be destroyed by man, and man should go forth from death. For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally molded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners,3663 and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation. . . . God recapitulated in Himself the ancient formation of man, that He might kill sin, deprive death of its power, and vivify man; and therefore His works are true.

1. But again, those who assert that He was simply a mere man, begotten by Joseph, remaining in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a state of death having been not as yet joined to the Word of God the Father, nor receiving liberty through the Son, as He does Himself declare: "If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed."3665 But, being ignorant of Him who from the virgin is Emmanuel, they are deprived of His gift, which is eternal life;3666 and not receiving the incorruptible Word, they remain in mortal flesh, and are debtors to death, not obtaining the antidote of life. To whom the Word says, mentioning His own gift of grace: "I said, you are all the sons of the Highest, and gods; but you shall die like men."3667 He speaks undoubtedly these words to those who have not received the gift of adoption, but who despise the incarnation of the pure generation of the Word of God,3668 defraud human nature of promotion into God, and prove themselves ungrateful to the Word of God, who became flesh for them. For it was for this end that the Word of God was made man, and He who was the Son of God became the Son of man, that man, having been taken into the Word, and receiving the adoption, might become the son of God. For by no other means could we have attained to incorruptibility and immortality, unless we had been united to incorruptibility and immortality. But how could we be joined to incorruptibility and immortality, 449 unless, first, incorruptibility and immortality had become that which we also are, so that the corruptible might be swallowed up by incorruptibility, and the mortal by immortality, that we might receive the adoption of sons?   2.

1. Long-suffering therefore was God, when man became a defaulter, as foreseeing that victory which should be granted to him through the Word. For, when strength was made perfect in weakness,3683 it showed the kindness and transcendent power of God. For as He patiently suffered Jonah to be swallowed by the whale, not that he should be swallowed up and perish altogether, but that, having been cast out again, he might be the more subject to God, and might glorify Him the more who had conferred upon him such an unhoped-for deliverance, and might bring the Ninevites to a lasting repentance, so that they should be converted to the Lord, who would deliver them from death, having been struck with awe by that portent which had been wrought in Jonah's case, as the Scripture says of them, "And they returned each from his evil way, and the unrighteousness which was in their hands, saying, "Who knows if God will repent, and turn away His anger from us, and 450 we shall not perish?"3684-so also, from the beginning, did God permit man to be swallowed up by the great whale, who was the author of transgression, not that he should perish altogether when so engulfed; but, arranging and preparing the plan of salvation, which was accomplished by the Word, through the sign of Jonah, for those who held the same opinion as Jonah regarding the Lord, and who confessed, and said, "I am a servant of the Lord, and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land."3685 [This was done] that man, receiving an unhoped-for salvation from God, might rise from the dead, and glorify God, and repeat that word which was uttered in prophecy by Jonah: "I cried by reason of mine affliction to the Lord my God, and He heard me out of the belly of hell;"3686 and that he might always continue glorifying God, and giving thanks without ceasing, for that salvation which he has derived from Him, "that no flesh should glory in the Lord's presence;"

For he who holds, without pride and boasting, the true glory (opinion) regarding created things and the Creator, who is the Almighty God of all, and who has granted existence to all; [such a person,] continuing in His love3690 and subjection, and giving of thanks, shall also receive from Him the greater glory of promotion,3691 looking forward to the time when he shall become like Him who died for him, for He, too, "was made in the likeness of sinful flesh,"3692 to condemn sin, and to cast it, as now a condemned thing, away beyond the flesh, but that He might call man forth into His own likeness, assigning him as [His own] imitator to God, and imposing on him His Father's law, in order that he may see God, and granting him power to receive the Father.

On this account, therefore, the Lord Himself,3694 who is Emmanuel from the virgin,3695 is the sign of our salvation, since it was the Lord Himself who saved them, because they could not be saved by their own instrumentality; and, therefore, when Paul sets forth human infirmity, he says: "For I know that there dwells in my flesh no good thing,"3696 showing that the "good thing" of our salvation is not from us, but from God. And again: "Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"3697 Then he introduces the Deliverer, [saying,] "The grace of Jesus Christ our Lord."

4. Again, that it should not be a mere man who should save us, nor [one] without flesh-for the angels are without flesh-[the same prophet] announced, saying: "Neither an elder, nor angel, but the Lord Himself will save them because He loves them, and will spare them: He will Himself set them free."   

*  Irenaeus quotes this as from Isaiah on the present occasion; but in book iv. 22, 1, we find him referring the same passage to Jeremiah. It is somewhat remarkable that it is to be found in neither prophet, although Justin Martyr, in his dialogue with Trypho, [chap. lxxii. and notes, Dial. with Trypho, in this volume,] brings it forward as an argument against him, and directly accuses the Jews of having fraudulently removed it from the sacred text. It is, however, to be found in no ancient version of Jewish Targum, which fact may be regarded as a decisive proof of its spuriousness. 

And that it was not a mere man who died for us, Isaiah says: "And the holy Lord remembered His dead Israel, who had slept in the land of sepulture; and He came down to preach His salvation to them, that He might save them."  . . . And again, specifying the place of His advent, he says: "The Lord has spoken from Zion, and He has uttered His voice from Jerusalem."

that it is from that region which is towards the south of the inheritance of Judah that the Son of God shall come, who is God, and who was from Bethlehem, where the Lord was born [and] will send out His praise through all the earth, thus3705 says the prophet Habakkuk: "God shall come from the south, and the Holy One from Mount Effrem. His power covered the heavens over, and the earth is full of His praise. Before His face shall go forth the Word, and His feet shall advance in the plains."3706 Thus he indicates in clear terms that He is God, and that His advent was [to take place] in Bethlehem, and from Mount Effrem which is towards the south of the inheritance, and that [He is] man. For he says, "His feet shall advance in the plains:" and this is an indication proper to man.

1. God, then, was made man, and the Lord did Himself save us, giving us the token of the virgin. But not as some allege, among those now presuming to expound the Scripture, [thus:] "Behold, a young woman shall conceive, and bring forth a son," as Theodotion the Ephesian has interpreted, and Aquila of Pontus [Ponticus], both Jewish proselytes. The Ebionites, following these, assert that He was begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvelous dispensation of God, and setting aside the testimony of the prophets which proceeded from God.

For truly this prediction was uttered before the removal of the people to Babylon; that is, before the supremacy acquired by the Medes and Persians. But it was translated into Greek by the Jews themselves, much before the period of our Lord's advent, that there might remain no suspicion that perchance the Jews, complying with our humor, did put this interpretation upon these words. They indeed, had they been cognizant of our future existence, and that we should use these proofs from the Scriptures, would themselves not have hesitated to burn their own Scriptures, which declare that all other nations partake of [eternal] life, and show that they who boast themselves as being the house of Jacob and the people of Israel, are disinherited from the favor [grace] of God.

2. For before the Romans possessed their kingdom, while as yet the Macedonians held Asia, Ptolemy the son of Lagus, being anxious to adorn the library which he had founded in Alexandria, with a collection of the writings of all men, which were [works] of merit, made request to the people of Jerusalem, that they should have their Scriptures translated into the Greek language. And they-for at that time they were still subject to the Macedonians-sent to Ptolemy seventy of their elders, who were thoroughly skilled in the Scriptures and in both the languages, to carry out what he had desired. But he, wishing to test them individually, and fearing lest they might perchance, by taking counsel together, conceal the truth in the Scriptures, by their interpretation, separated them from each other, and commanded them all to write the same translation. He did this with respect to all the books. But when they came together in the same place before Ptolemy, and each of them compared his own interpretation with that of every other, God was indeed glorified, and the Scriptures were acknowledged as truly divine. For all of them read out the common translation [which they had prepared] in the very same words and the very same names, from beginning to end, so that even the Gentiles present perceived that the Scriptures had been interpreted by the inspiration of God.

Since, therefore, the Scriptures have been translated with such fidelity, and by the grace of God, and since from these God has prepared and formed again our faith towards His Son, and has preserved to us the unadulterated Scriptures in Egypt, where the house of Jacob flourished, fleeing from the famine in Canaan; where also our Lord was preserved when He fled from the persecution set on foot by Herod; and [since] this translation of these Scriptures was made prior to our Lord's descent [to earth], and came into being before the Christians appeared -for our Lord was born about the forty-first year of the reign of Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the Scriptures were interpreted;-[since these things are so, I say,] truly these men are proved to be impudent and presumptuous, who would now show a desire to make different translations, when we refute them out of these Scriptures, and shut them up to a belief in the advent of the Son of God. But our faith is steadfast, unfeigned, and the only true one, having clear proof from these Scriptures, which were interpreted in the way I have related; and the preaching of the Church is without interpolation. For the apostles, since they are of more ancient date than all these [heretics], agree with this aforesaid translation; and the translation harmonizes with the tradition of the apostles.

4. For the one and the same Spirit of God, who proclaimed by the prophets what and of what sort the advent of the Lord should be, did by these elders give a just translation of what had been truly prophesied; and He did Himself, by the apostles, announce that the fullness of the times of the adoption had arrived, that the kingdom of heaven had drawn nigh, and that He was dwelling within those that believe on Him who was born Emmanuel of the virgin. To this effect they testify, [saying,] that before Joseph had come together with Mary, while she therefore remained in virginity, "she was found with child of the Holy Ghost;"

{Mt 1:23; Isa 7:10-17; Christ, Two Natures}
But the elders have thus translated what Esaias said: "And the Lord, moreover, said unto Ahaz, Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your God out of the depth below, or from the height above. And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. And he said, It is not a small thing for you to weary men; and how does the Lord weary them? Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and you shall call His name Emmanuel. Butter and honey shall He eat: before He knows or chooses out things that are evil, He shall exchange them for what is good; for before the child knows good or evil, He shall not consent to evil, that He may choose that which is good." Carefully, then, has the Holy Ghost pointed out, by what has been said, His birth from a virgin, and His essence, that He is God (for the name Emmanuel indicates this). And He shows that He is a man, when He says, "Butter and honey shall He eat;" and in that He terms Him a child also, [in saying,] "before He knows good and evil;" for these are all the tokens of a human infant. But that He "will not consent to evil, that He may choose that which is good,"-this is proper to God; that by the fact, that He shall eat butter and honey, we should not understand that He is a mere man only, nor, on the other hand, from the name Emmanuel, should suspect Him to be God without flesh.  location 15337

5. And when He says, "Hear, O house of David," He performed the part of one indicating that He whom God promised David that He would raise up from the fruit of his belly (ventris) an eternal King, is the same who was born of the virgin, herself of the lineage of David. For on this account also, He promised that the King should be "of the fruit of his belly," which was the appropriate [term to use with respect] to a virgin conceiving, and not "of the fruit of his loins," nor "of the fruit of his reins," which expression is appropriate to a generating man, and a woman conceiving by a man.* In this promise, therefore, the Scripture excluded all virile influence; yet it certainly is not mentioned that He who was born was not from the will of man. But it has fixed and established "the fruit of the belly," that it might declare the generation of Him who should be [born] from the virgin, as Elisabeth testified when filled with the Holy Ghost, saying to Mary, "Blessed art you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your belly;" the Holy Ghost pointing out to those willing to hear, that the promise which God had made, of raising up a King from the fruit of [David's] belly, was fulfilled in the birth from the virgin, that is, from Mary. Let those, therefore, who alter the passage of Isaiah thus, "Behold, a young woman shall conceive," and who will have Him to be Joseph's son, also alter the form of the promise which was given to David, when God promised him to raise up, from the fruit of his belly, the horn of Christ the King. But they did not understand, otherwise they would have presumed to alter even this passage also.   location 15344

For what great thing or what sign should have been in this, that a young woman conceiving by a man should bring forth,-a thing which happens to all women that produce offspring?

For this stone from the earth derives existence from both the power and the wisdom of God. Wherefore also Isaiah says: "Thus says the Lord, Behold, I deposit in the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, the chief, the corner-one, to be had in honor."

9. But besides, if indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not, according to Jeremiah, be either king or heir. For Joseph is shown to be the son of Joachim and Jechoniah, as also Matthew sets forth in his pedigree. But Jechoniah, and all his posterity, were disinherited from the kingdom; Jeremiah thus declaring, "As I live, says the Lord, if Jechoniah the son of Joachim king of Judah had been made the signet of my right hand, I would pluck him thence, and deliver him into the hand of those seeking your life." And again: "Jechoniah is dishonored as a useless vessel, for he has been cast into a land which he knew not. Earth, hear the word of the Lord: Write this man a disinherited person; for none of his seed, sitting on the throne of David, shall prosper, or be a prince in Judah." And again, God speaks of Joachim his father: "Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Joachim his father, king of Judea, There shall be from him none sitting upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the heat of day, and in the frost of night. And I will look upon him, and upon his sons, and will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, upon the land of Judah, all the evils that I have pronounced against them." Those, therefore, who say that He was begotten of Joseph, and that they have hope in Him, do cause themselves to be disinherited from the kingdom, failing under the curse and rebuke directed against Jechoniah and his seed. Because for this reason have these things been spoken concerning Jechoniah, the [Holy] Spirit foreknowing the doctrines of the evil teachers; that they may learn that from his seed-that is, from Joseph-He was not to be born but that, according to the promise of God, from David's belly the King eternal is raised up, who sums up all things in Himself, and has gathered into Himself the ancient formation [of man].   location 15371

10. For as by one man's disobedience sin entered, and death obtained [a place] through sin; so also by the obedience of one man, righteousness having been introduced, shall cause life to fructify in those persons who in times past were dead. And as the protoplast himself Adam, had his substance from untilled and as yet virgin soil ("for God had not yet sent rain, and man had not tilled the ground" ), and was formed by the hand of God, that is, by the Word of God, for "all things were made by Him," and the Lord took dust from the earth and formed man; so did He who is the Word, recapitulating Adam in Himself, rightly receive a birth, enabling Him to gather up Adam [into Himself], from Mary, who was as yet a virgin. If, then, the first Adam had a man for his father, and was born of human seed, it were reasonable to say that the second Adam was begotten of Joseph. But if the former was taken from the dust, and God was his Maker, it was incumbent that the latter also, making a recapitulation in Himself, should be formed as man by God. . . . Why, then, did not God again take dust, but wrought so that the formation should be made of Mary? It was that there might not be another formation called into being, nor any other which should [require to] be saved, but that the very same formation should be summed up [in Christ as had existed in Adam], the analogy having been preserved.       location 15384

4. In accordance with this design, Mary the virgin is found obedient, saying, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word." But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin (for in Paradise "they were both naked, and were not ashamed,"3748 inasmuch as they, having been created a short time previously, had no understanding of the procreation of children: for it was necessary that they should first come to adult age,3749 and then multiply from that time onward), having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed [to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race. And on this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, the wife of him who had betrothed her, although she was as yet a virgin; thus indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve, because what is joined together could not otherwise be put asunder than by inversion of the process by which these bonds of union had arisen;3750 so that the former ties be cancelled by the latter, that the latter may set the former again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that the first compact looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position of the first which has been cancelled. . . .

For at the first Adam became a vessel in his (Satan's) possession, whom he did also hold under his power, that is, by bringing sin on him iniquitously, and under color of immortality entailing death upon him. For, while promising that they should be as gods, which was in no way possible for him to be, he wrought death in them: wherefore he who had led man captive, was justly captured in his turn by God; but man, who had been led captive, was loosed from the bonds of condemnation.       location 15447

2. But this is Adam, if the truth should be told, the first formed man, of whom the Scripture says that the Lord spoke, "Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness;"3758 and we are all from him: and as we are from him, therefore have we all inherited his title. But inasmuch as man is saved, it is fitting that he who was created the original man should be saved. For it is too absurd to maintain, that he who was so deeply injured by the enemy, and was the first to suffer captivity, was not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but that his children were, -those whom he had begotten in the same captivity. Neither would the enemy appear to be as yet conquered, if the old spoils remained with him. To give an illustration: If a hostile force had overcome certain [enemies], had bound them, and led them away captive, and held them for a long time in servitude, so that they begot children among them; and somebody, compassionating those who had been made slaves, should overcome this same hostile force; he certainly would not act equitably, were he to liberate the children of those who had been led captive, from the sway of those who had enslaved their fathers, but should leave these latter, who had suffered the act of capture, subject to their enemies,-those, too, on whose very account he had proceeded to this retaliation,- the children succeeding to liberty through the avenging of their fathers' cause, but not3759 so that their fathers, who suffered the act of capture itself, should be left [in bondage].

It was for this reason, too, that immediately after Adam had transgressed, as the Scripture relates, He pronounced no curse against Adam personally, but against the ground, in reference to his works, as a certain person among the ancients has observed: "God did indeed transfer the curse to the earth, that it might not remain in man." But man received, as the punishment of his transgression, the toilsome task of tilling the earth, and to eat bread in the sweat of his face, and to return to the dust from whence he was taken. Similarly also did the woman [receive] toil, and labor, and groans, and the pangs of childbirth, and a state of subjection, that is, that she should serve her husband; so that they should neither perish altogether when cursed by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to despise God. But the curse in all its fullness fell upon the serpent, which had beguiled them. "And God," it is declared, "said to the serpent: Because you have done this, cursed art you above all cattle, and above all the beasts of the earth."3761 And this same thing does the Lord also say in the Gospel, to those who are found upon the left hand: "Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels;"3762 indicating that eternal fire was not originally prepared for man, but for him who beguiled man, and caused him to offend-for him, I say, who is chief of the apostasy, and for those angels who became apostates along with him; which [fire], indeed, they too shall justly feel, who, like him, persevere in works of wickedness, without repentance, and without retracing their steps.     location 15467

4. [These act] as Cain [did, who], when he was counselled by God to be still*, because he had not made an equitable division of that share to which his brother was entitled, but with envy and malice thought that he could domineer over him, not only did not acquiesce, but even added sin to sin, indicating his state of mind by his action. For what he had planned, that did he also put in practice: he tyrannized over and slew him; God subjecting the just to the unjust, that the former might be proved as the just one by the things which he suffered, and the latter detected as the unjust by those which he perpetrated. And he was not softened even by this, nor did he stop short with that evil deed; but being asked where his brother was, he said, "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?" extending and aggravating [his] wickedness by his answer. For if it is wicked to slay a brother, much worse is it thus insolently and irreverently to reply to the omniscient God. And for this he did himself bear a curse about with him, because he gratuitously 457 brought an offering of sin, having had no reverence for God, nor being put to confusion by the act of fratricide.   location 15478

5. The case of Adam, however, had no analogy with this [of Cain], but was altogether different. For, having been beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality, he is immediately seized with terror, and hides himself; not as if he were able to escape from God; but, in a state of confusion at having transgressed His command, he feels unworthy to appear before and to hold converse with God. Now, "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;" the sense of sin leads to repentance, and God bestows His compassion upon those who are penitent. For [Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through means of the girdle [which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves, while there were many other leaves, which would have irritated his body in a less degree.  location 15484

God bestows His compassion upon those who are penitent. For [Adam] showed his repentance by his conduct, through means of the girdle [which he used], covering himself with fig-leaves, while there were many other leaves, which would have irritated his body in a less degree. He, however, adopted a dress conformable to his disobedience, being awed by the fear of God; and resisting the erring, the lustful propensity of his flesh (since he had lost his natural disposition and child-like mind, and had come to the knowledge of evil things), he girded a bridle of continence upon himself and his wife, fearing God, and waiting for His coming, and indicating, as it were, some such thing [as follows]: Inasmuch as, he says, I have by disobedience lost that robe of sanctity which I had from the Spirit, I do now also acknowledge that I am deserving of a covering of this nature, which affords no gratification, but which gnaws and frets the body. And he would no doubt have retained this clothing forever, thus humbling himself, if God, who is merciful, had not clothed them with tunics of skins instead of fig-leaves.   location 15487

For this purpose [of mercy], too, He interrogates them, that the blame might light upon the woman; and again, He interrogates her, that she might convey the blame to the serpent. For she related what had occurred. "The serpent," says she, "beguiled me, and I did eat."3766 But He put no question to the serpent; for He knew that he had been the prime mover in the guilty deed; but He pronounced the curse upon him in the first instance, that it might fall upon man with a mitigated rebuke. For God detested him who had led man astray, but by degrees, and little by little, He showed compassion to him who had been beguiled.   location 15493

But He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing death, and thus causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at length to live to sin, and dying to it, might begin to live to God.   location 15499

the preaching of the Church is everywhere consistent, and continues in an even course, and receives testimony from the prophets, the apostles, and all the disciples-as I have proved-through [those in] the beginning, the middle, and the end, and through the entire dispensation of God, and that well-grounded system which tends to man's salvation, namely, our faith; which, having been received from the Church, we do preserve, and which always, by the Spirit of God, renewing its youth, as if it were some precious deposit in an excellent vessel, causes the vessel itself containing it to renew its youth also. For this gift of God has been entrusted to the church, as breath was to the first created man,3783 for this purpose, that all the members receiving it may be vivified; and the [means of] communion with Christ has been distributed throughout it, that is, the Holy Spirit, the earnest of incorruption, the means of confirming our faith, and the ladder of ascent to God. "For in the church," it is said, "God has set apostles, prophets, teachers,"3784 and all the other means through which the Spirit works; of which all those are not partakers who do not join themselves to the church, but defraud themselves of life through their perverse opinions and infamous behaviour. For where the church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is the church, and every kind of grace; but the Spirit is truth. Those, therefore, who do not partake of Him, are neither nourished into life from the mother's breasts, nor do they enjoy that most limpid fountain which issues from the body of Christ; but they dig for themselves broken cisterns3785 out of earthly trenches, and drink putrid water out of the mire, fleeing from the faith of the church lest they be convicted; and rejecting the Spirit, that they may not be instructed.     location 15531

And, for this reason certain of the Gentiles, who were less addicted to [sensual] allurements and voluptuousness, and were not led away to such a degree of superstition with regard to idols, being moved, though but slightly, by His providence, were nevertheless convinced that they should call the Maker of this universe the Father, who exercises a providence over all things, and arranges the affairs of our world.

For if the judicial one is not also good, to bestow favors upon the deserving, and to direct reproofs against those requiring them, he will appear neither a just nor a wise judge. On the other hand, the good God, if he is merely good, and not one who tests those upon whom he shall send his goodness, will be out of the range of justice and goodness; and his goodness will seem imperfect, as not saving all; [for it should do so,] if it be not accompanied with judgment.   location 15564

Even as Esaias says, "The children of Jacob shall strike root, and Israel shall flourish, and the whole world shall be filled with his fruit."(1) The fruit, therefore, having been sown throughout all the world, she (Jerusalem) was deservedly forsaken, and those things which had formerly brought forth fruit abundantly were taken away; for from these, according to the flesh, were Christ and the apostles enabled to bring forth fruit.  location 15737

"Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness."(6) In the first place, [he believed] that He was the maker of heaven and earth, the only God; and in the next place, that He would make his seed as the stars of heaven. This is what is meant by Paul, [when he says,] "as lights in the world."(7) Righteously, therefore, having left his earthly kindred, he followed the Word of God, walking as a pilgrim with the Word, that he might [afterwards] have his abode with the Word.
4. Righteously also the apostles, being of the race of Abraham, left the ship and their father, and followed the Word. Righteously also do we, possessing the same faith as Abraham, and taking up the cross as Isaac did the wood follow Him. For in Abraham man had learned beforehand, and had been accustomed to follow the Word of God. For Abraham, according to his faith, followed the command of the Word of God, and with a ready mind delivered up, as a sacrifice to God, his only- begotten and beloved son, in order that God also might be pleased to offer up for all his seed His own beloved and only-begotten Son, as a sacrifice for our redemption.

Since, therefore, Abraham was a prophet and saw in the Spirit the day of the Lord's coming, and the dispensation of His suffering, through whom both he himself and all who, following the example of his faith, trust in God, should be saved, he rejoiced exceedingly. The Lord, therefore, was not unknown to Abraham, whose day he desired to see;(9) nor, again, was the Lord's Father, for he had learned from the Word of the Lord, and believed Him; wherefore it was accounted to him by the Lord for righteousness. location 15796

And for this reason all spoke with Christ when He was present [upon earth], and they named Him God. Yea, even the demons exclaimed, on beholding the Son: "We know you who You are, the Holy One of God."'

But the Son, administering all things for the Father, works from the beginning even to the end, and without Him no man can attain the knowledge of God. For the Son is the knowledge of the Father; but the knowledge of the Son is in the Father, and has been revealed through the Son; and this was the reason why the Lord declared: "No man knows the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, save the Son, and those to whomsoever the Son shall reveal [Him]."(5) For "shall reveal" was said not with reference to the future alone, as if then [only] the Word had begun to manifest the Father when He was born of Mary, but it applies indifferently throughout all time. For the Son, being present with His own handiwork from the beginning, reveals the Father to all; to whom He wills, and when He wills, and as the Father wills.  location 15861

It is clear therefore, that He loosed and vivified those who believe in Him as Abraham did, doing nothing contrary to the Law when He healed upon the Sabbath-day.

For the Lord is the good man of the house, who rules the entire house of His Father; and who delivers a law suited both for slaves and those who are as yet undisciplined; and gives fitting precepts to those that are free, and have been justified by faith, as well as throws His own inheritance open to those that are sons. And He called His disciples "scribes" and "teachers of the kingdom of heaven;" of whom also He elsewhere says to the Jews: "Behold, I send unto you wise men, and scribes, and teachers; and some of them you shall kill, and persecute from city to city."(2) Now, without contradiction, He means by those things which are brought forth from the treasure new and old, the two covenants; the old, that giving of the law which took place formerly.  location 15952

Wherefore also Esaias declares: "Thy dealers mix the wine with water,"(6) showing that the elders were in the habit of mingling a watered tradition with the simple command of God; that is, they set up a spurious law, and one contrary to the [true] law; as also the Lord made plain, when He said to them, "Why do you transgress the commandment of God, for the sake of your tradition?"(7) For not only by actual transgression did they set the law of God at nought, mingling the wine with water; but they also set up their own law in opposition to it, which is termed, even to the present day, the pharisaical. In this [law] they suppress certain things, add others, and interpret others, again, as they think proper, which their teachers use, each one in particular; and desiring to uphold these traditions, they were unwilling to be subject to the law of God, which prepares them for the coming of Christ. location 16069

He therefore did not throw blame upon that law which was given by Moses, when He exhorted it to be observed, Jerusalem being as yet in safety; but He did throw blame upon those persons, because they repeated indeed the words of the law, yet were without love. And for this reason were they held as being unrighteous as respects God, and as respects their neighbors. As also Isaiah says: "This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me: howbeit in vain do they worship Me, teaching the doctrines and the commandments of men."(5) He does not call the law given by Moses commandments of men, but the traditions of the elders themselves which they had invented, and in upholding which they made the law of God of none effect, and were on this account also not subject to His Word. For this is what Paul says concerning these men: "For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth."(6) And how is Christ the end of the law, if He be not also the final Cause of it?

But when the former said, "All these have I done" (and most likely he had not kept them, for in that case the Lord would not have said to him, "Keep the commandments"), the Lord, exposing his covetousness, said to him, "If you will be perfect, go, sell all that you hast, and distribute to the poor; and come, follow me;" promising to those who would act thus, the portion belonging to the apostles (apostolorum partem).  location 16106

1. And that the Lord did not abrogate the natural [precepts] of the law, by which man(2) is justified, which also those who were justified by faith, and who pleased God, did observe previous to the giving of the law, but that He extended and fulfilled them, is shown from His words. "For," He remarks, "it has been said to them of old time, Do not commit adultery. But I say unto you, That everyone who has looked upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart."(3) And again: "It has been said, you shall not kill. But I say unto you, Everyone who is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment."(4) And, "It has been said, you shall not forswear yourself. But I say unto you, Swear not at all; but let your conversation be, Yea, yea, and Nay, nay."(5) And other statements of a like nature. For all these do not contain or imply an opposition to and an overturning of the [precepts] of the past, as Marcion's followers do strenuously maintain; but [they exhibit] a fulfilling and an extension of them, as He does Himself declare: "Unless your righteousness shall exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."(6) For what meant the excess referred to? In the first place, [we must] believe not only in the Father, but also in His Son now revealed; for He it is who leads man into fellowship and unity with God. In the next place, [we must] not only say, but we must do; for they said, but did not. And [we must] not only abstain from evil deeds, but even from the desires after them. Now He did not teach us these things as being opposed to the law, but as fulfilling the law, and implanting in us the varied righteousness of the law. That would have been contrary to the law, if He had commanded His disciples to do anything which the law had prohibited. But this which He did command--namely, not only to abstain from things forbidden by the law, but even from longing after them--is not contrary to [the law], as I have remarked, neither is it the utterance of one destroying the law, but of one fulfilling, extending, and affording greater scope to it.

2. For the Law, since it was laid down for those in bondage, used to instruct the soul by means of those corporeal objects which were of an external nature, drawing it, as by a bond, to obey its commandments, that man might learn to serve God. But the Word set free the soul, and taught that through it the body should be willingly purified. Which having been accomplished, it followed as of course, that the bonds of slavery should be removed, to which man had now become accustomed, and that he should follow God without fetters: moreover, that the laws of liberty should be extended, and subjection to the king increased, so that no one who is converted should appear unworthy to Him who set him free, but that the piety and obedience due to the Master of the household should be equally rendered both by servants and children; while the children possess greater confidence [than the servants], inasmuch as the working of liberty is greater and more glorious than that obedience which is rendered in [a state of] slavery.

The working of liberty is greater and more glorious than that obedience which is rendered in [a state of] slavery. 3. And for this reason did the Lord, instead of that [commandment], "You shall not commit adultery," forbid even concupiscence; and instead of that which runs thus, "You shall not kill," He prohibited anger; and instead of the law enjoining the giving of tithes, [He told us] to share(7) all our possessions with the poor; and not to love our neighbors only, but even our enemies; and not merely to be liberal givers and bestowers, but even that we should present a gratuitous gift to those who take away our goods. For "to him that taketh away your coat," He says, "give to him your cloak also; and from him that taketh away your goods, ask them not again; and as you would that men should do unto you, do you unto them:"(8) so that we may not grieve as those who are unwilling to be defrauded, but may rejoice as those who have given willingly, and as rather conferring a favor upon our neighbors than yielding to necessity. "And if anyone," He says, "shall compel you [to go] a mile, go with him twain;"(9) so that you mayest not follow him as a slave, but may as a free man go before him, showing yourself in all things kindly disposed and useful to your neighbor, not regarding their evil intentions, but performing your kind offices, assimilating yourself to the Father, "who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain upon the just and unjust."(1) Now all these [precepts], as I have already observed, were not the injunctions] of one doing away with the law, but of one fulfilling, extending, and widening it among us; just as if one should say, that the more extensive operation of liberty implies that a more complete subjection and affection towards our Liberator had been implanted within us. For He did not set us free for this purpose, that we should depart from Him (no one, indeed, while placed out of reach of the Lord's benefits, has power to procure for himself the means of salvation), but that the more we receive His grace, the more we should love Him.   location 16136

4. Inasmuch, then, as all natural precepts are common to us and to them (the Jews), they had in them indeed the beginning and origin; but in us they have received growth and completion. For to yield assent to God, and to follow His Word, and to love Him above all, and one's neighbor as one's self (now man is neighbor to man), and to abstain from every evil deed, and all other things of a like nature which are common to both [covenants], do reveal one and the same God. But this is our Lord, the Word of God, who in the first instance certainly drew slaves to God, but afterwards He set those free who were subject to Him, as He does Himself declare to His disciples: "I will not now call you servants, for the servant knows not what his lord does; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard from My Father I have made known."(2) For in that which He says, "I will not now call you servants," He indicates in the most marked manner that it was Himself who did originally appoint for men that bondage with respect to God through the law, and then afterwards conferred upon them freedom. And in that He says, "For the servant knows not what his lord does," He points out, by means of His own advent, the ignorance of a people in a servile condition. But when He terms His disciples "the friends of God," He plainly declares Himself to be the Word of God, whom Abraham also followed voluntarily and under no compulsion (sine vinculis), because of the noble nature of his faith, and so became "the friend of God."(3) But the Word of God did not accept of the friendship of Abraham, as though He stood in need of it, for He was perfect from the beginning ("Before Abraham was," He says, "I am"(4)), but that He in His goodness might bestow eternal life upon Abraham himself, inasmuch as the friendship of God imparts immortality to those who embrace it.   location 16158

1. In the beginning, therefore, did God form Adam, not as if He stood in need of man, but that He might have [someone] upon whom to confer His benefits. For not alone antecedently to Adam, but also before all creation, the Word glorified His Father, remaining in Him; and was Himself glorified by the Father, as He did Himself declare, "Father, glorify you me with the glory which I had with you before the world was."(5) Nor did He stand in need of our service when He ordered us to follow Him; but He thus bestowed salvation upon ourselves. For to follow the Savior is to be a partaker of salvation, and to follow light is to receive light. But those who are in light do not themselves illumine the light, but are illumined and revealed by it location 16174

[God] does not receive any benefit from them: for He is rich, perfect, and in need of nothing. But for this reason does God demand service from men, in order that, since He is good and merciful, He may benefit those who continue in His service. For, as much as God is in want of nothing, so much does man stand in need of fellowship with God. For this is the glory of man, to continue and remain permanently in God's service. Wherefore also did the Lord say to His disciples, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you;"(6) indicating that they did not glorify Him when they followed Him; but that, in following the Son of God, they were glorified by Him. And again, "I will, that where I am, there they also may be, that they may behold My glory;"(7) not vainly boasting because of this, but desiring that His disciples should share in His glory    location 16182

2. Thus it was, too, that God formed man at the first, because of His munificence; but chose the patriarchs for the sake of their salvation; and prepared a people beforehand, teaching the headstrong to follow God; and raised up prophets upon earth, accustoming man to bear His Spirit [within him], and to hold communion with God: He Himself, indeed, having need of nothing, but granting communion with Himself to those who stood in need of it, and sketching out, like an architect, the plan of salvation to those that pleased Him. And He did Himself furnish guidance to those who beheld Him not in Egypt, while to those who became unruly in the desert He promulgated a law very suitable [to their condition]. Then, on the people who entered into the good land He bestowed a noble inheritance; and He killed the fatted calf for those converted to the Father, and presented them with the finest robe.(3) Thus, in a variety of ways, He adjusted the human race to an agreement with salvation.  location 16192

Thus, too, He imposed upon the [Jewish] people the construction of the tabernacle, the building of the temple, the election of the Levites, sacrifices also, and oblations, legal monitions, and all the other service of the law. He does Himself truly want none of these things, for He is always full of all good, and had in Himself all the odor of kindness, and every perfume of sweet-smelling aromas, even before Moses existed. Moreover, He instructed the people, who were prone to turn to idols, instructing them by repeated appeals to persevere and to serve God, calling them to the things of primary importance by means of those which were secondary; that is, to things that are real, by means of those that are typical; and by things temporal, to eternal; 
and by things temporal, to eternal; and by the carnal to the spiritual; and by the earthly to the heavenly; as was also said to Moses, "You shall make all things after the pattern of those things which you sawest in the mount."

And again, having first mentioned what are contained in the Law, he goes on to say: "Now all these things happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our admonition, upon whom the end of the ages is come."

1. They (the Jews) had therefore a law, a course of discipline, and a prophecy of future things. For God at the first, indeed, warning them by means of natural precepts, which from the beginning He had implanted in mankind, that is, by means of the Decalogue (which, if anyone does not observe, he has no salvation), did then demand nothing more of them. As Moses says in Deuteronomy, "These are all the words which the Lord spoke to the whole assembly of the sons of Israel on the mount, and He added no more; and He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me." For this reason [He did so], that they who are willing to follow Him might keep these commandments. But when they turned themselves to make a calf, and had gone back in their minds to Egypt, desiring to be slaves instead of free-men, they were placed for the future in a state of servitude suited to their wish,-[a slavery] which did not indeed cut them off from God, but subjected them to the yoke of bondage. As Ezekiel the prophet, when stating the reasons for the giving of such a law, declares: "And their eyes were after the desire of their heart; and I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments in which they shall not live."    location 16222

As also Moses himself says to the people in Deuteronomy: "The LORD your God formed a covenant in Horeb. The LORD formed not this covenant with your fathers, but for you."(9) location 16272

But the righteous fathers had the meaning of the Decalogue written in their hearts and souls, that is, they loved the God who made them, and did no injury to their neighbor. There was therefore no occasion that they should be cautioned by prohibitory mandates (correptoriis literis), because they had the righteousness of the Law in themselves. But when this righteousness and love to God had passed into oblivion, and became extinct in Egypt, God did necessarily, because of His great goodwill to men, reveal Himself by a voice. . .  location 16275

For the glory of God was wanting to man, which he could obtain in no other way than by serving God. . . .

5. The laws of bondage, however, were one by one promulgated to the people by Moses, suited for their instruction or for their punishment, as Moses himself declared: "And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments."(3) These things, therefore, which were given for bondage, and for a sign to them, He cancelled by the new covenant of liberty. But He has increased and widened those laws which are natural, and noble, and common to all, granting to men largely and without grudging, by means of adoption, to know God the Father, and to love Him with the whole heart, and to follow His word unswervingly, while they abstain not only from evil deeds, but even from the desire after them. But He has also increased the feeling of reverence; for sons should have more veneration than slaves, and greater love for their father. And therefore the Lord says, "As to every idle word that men have spoken, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment."(4) And, "he who has looked upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery with her already in his heart;"(5) and, "he that is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment."(6) [All this is declared,] that we may know that we shall give account to God not of deeds only, as slaves, but even of words and thoughts, as those who have truly received the power of liberty, in which [condition] a man is more severely tested, whether he will reverence, and fear, and love the Lord. And for this reason Peter says "that we have not liberty as a cloak of maliciousness,"(7) but as the means of testing and evidencing faith.

1. Moreover, the prophets indicate in the fullest manner that God stood in no need of their slavish obedience, but that it was upon their own account that He enjoined certain observances in the law. And again, that God needed not their oblation, but [merely demanded it], on account of man himself who offers it, the Lord taught distinctly, as I have pointed out. For when He perceived them neglecting righteousness, and abstaining from the love of God, and imagining that God was to be propitiated by sacrifices and the other typical observances, Samuel did even thus speak to them: "God does not desire whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices, but He will have His voice to be hearkened to. Behold, a ready obedience is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."(8) David also says: "Sacrifice and oblation you did not desire, but mine ears have you perfected;(9) burnt-offerings also for sin you have not required."(10) He thus teaches them that God desires obedience, which renders them secure, rather than sacrifices and holocausts, which avail them nothing towards righteousness; and [by this declaration] he prophesies the new covenant at the same time. Still clearer, too, does he speak of these things in the fiftieth Psalm: "For if you hadst desired sacrifice, then would I have given it: you will not delight in burnt- offerings. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart the Lord will not despise."(11) Because, therefore, God stands in need of nothing, He declares in the preceding Psalm: "I will take no calves out of your house, nor he-goats out of your fold. For Mine are all the beasts of the earth, the herds and the oxen on the mountains: I know all the fowls of heaven, and the various tribes(12) of the field are Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you: for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?"(13) Then, lest it might be supposed that He refused these things in His anger, He continues, giving him (man) counsel: "Offer unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High; and call upon me in the day of your trouble, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me;"(14) rejecting, indeed, those things by which sinners imagined they could propitiate God, and showing that He does Himself stand in need of nothing; but He exhorts and advises them to those things by which man is justified and draws nigh to God. This same declaration does Esaias make: "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? says the Lord. I am full."(1) And when He had repudiated holocausts, and sacrifices, and oblations, as likewise the new moons, and the sabbaths, and the festivals, and all the rest of the services accompanying these, He continues, exhorting them to what pertained to salvation: "Wash you, make you clean, take away wickedness from your hearts from before mine eyes: cease from your evil ways, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow; and come, let us reason together, says the LORD."    location 16321

2. For it was not because He was angry, like a man, as many venture to say, that He rejected their sacrifices; but out of compassion to their blindness, and with the view of suggesting to them the true sacrifice, by offering which they shall appease God, that they may receive life from Him. As He elsewhere declares: "The sacrifice to God is an afflicted heart: a sweet aroma to God is a heart glorifying Him who formed it."* For if, when angry, He had repudiated these sacrifices of theirs, as if they were persons unworthy to obtain His compassion, He would not certainly have urged these same things upon them as those by which they might be saved. But inasmuch as God is merciful, He did not cut them off from good counsel. For after He had said by Jeremiah, "To what purpose bring you me incense from Saba, and cinnamon from a far country? your whole burnt- offerings and sacrifices are not acceptable to Me;"(3) He proceeds: "Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah. These things says the LORD, the God of Israel, Make straight your ways and your doings, and I will establish you in this place. Put not your trust in lying words, for they will not at all profit you, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, it is [here]."(4)    location 16334

3. And again, when He points out that it was not for this that He led them out of Egypt, that they might offer sacrifice to Him, but that, forgetting the idolatry of the Egyptians, they should be able to hear the voice of the Lord, which was to them salvation and glory, He declares by this same Jeremiah: "Thus says the LORD; Collect together your burnt-offerings with your sacrifices and eat flesh. For I spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: but this word I commanded them, saying, Hear My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people; and walk in all My ways whatsoever I have commanded you, that it may be well with you. But they obeyed not, nor hearkened; but walked in the imaginations of their own evil heart, and went backwards, and not forwards."(5) And again, when He declares by the same man, "But let him that glories, glory in this, to understand and know that I am the LORD, who doth exercise loving-kindness, and righteousness, and judgment in the earth;"(6) He adds, "For in these things I delight, says the LORD," but not in sacrifices, nor in holocausts, nor in oblations. For the people did not receive these precepts as of primary importance (principaliter), but as secondary, and for the reason already alleged, as Isaiah again says: "You have not [brought to] me the sheep of your holocaust, nor in your sacrifices have you glorified Me: you have not served me in sacrifices, nor in [the matter of] frankincense have you done anything laboriously; neither have you bought for me incense with money, nor have I desired the fat of your sacrifices; but you have stood before me in your sins and in your iniquities."(7) He says, therefore, "Upon this man will I look, even upon him that is humble, and meek, and who trembles at My words."(8) "For the fat and the fat flesh shall not take away from you your unrighteousness."(9) "This is the fast which I have chosen, says the LORD. Loose every band of wickedness, dissolve the connections of violent agreements, give rest to those that are shaken, and cancel every unjust document. Deal your bread to the hungry willingly, and lead into your house the roofless stranger. If you have seen the naked, cover him, and you shall not despise those of your own flesh and blood (domesticos seminis tui). Then shall your morning light break forth, and your health shall spring forth more speedily; and righteousness shall go before you, and the glory of the Lord shall surround you: and whilst you are yet speaking, I will say, Behold, here I am."(10) And Zechariah also, among the twelve prophets, pointing out to the people the will of God, says: "These things does the LORD Omnipotent declare: Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion each one to his brother. And oppress not the widow, and the orphan, and the proselyte, and the poor; and let none imagine evil against your brother in his heart."(11) And again, he says: "These are the words which you shall utter. Speak you the truth every man to his neighbor, and execute peaceful judgment in your gates, and let none of you imagine evil in his heart against his brother, and you shall not love false Oaths: for all these things I hate, says the LORD Almighty."(1)    location 16355

4. From all these it is evident that God did not seek sacrifices and holocausts from them, but faith, and obedience, and righteousness, because of their salvation. As God, when teaching them His will in Hosea the prophet, said, "I desire mercy rather than sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings."(3) Besides, our Lord also exhorted them to the same effect, when He said, "But if you had known what [this] meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless."(4) Thus does He bear witness to the prophets, that they preached the truth; but accuses these men (His hearers) of being foolish through their own fault.

For from the rising of the sun, unto the going down [of the same], My name is glorified among the Gentiles, and in every place incense is offered to My name, and a pure sacrifice; for great is My name among the Gentiles, says the LORD Omnipotent;"(7)--indicating in the plainest manner, by these words, that the former people [the Jews] shall indeed cease to make offerings to God, but that in every place sacrifice shall be offered to Him, and that a pure one; and His name is glorified among the Gentiles.(8)   location 16369

6. But what other name is there which is glorified among the Gentiles than that of our Lord, by whom the Father is glorified, and man also? And because it is [the name] of His own Son, who was made man by Him, He calls it His own. Just as a king, if he himself paints a likeness of his son, is right in calling this likeness his own, for both these reasons, because it is [the likeness] of his son, and because it is his own production; so also does the Father confess the name of Jesus Christ, which is throughout all the world glorified in the Church, to be His own, both because it is that of His Son, and because He who thus describes it gave Him for the salvation of men. Since, therefore, the name of the Son belongs to the Father, and since in the omnipotent God the Church makes offerings through Jesus Christ, He says well on both these grounds, "And in every place incense is offered to My name, and a pure sacrifice." Now John, in the Apocalypse, declares that the "incense" is "the prayers of the saints."(9)     location 16376

1. The oblation of the Church, therefore, which the Lord gave instructions to be offered throughout all the world, is accounted with God a pure sacrifice, and is acceptable to Him; not that He stands in need of a sacrifice from us, but that he who offers is himself glorified in what he does offer, if his gift be accepted. For by the gift both honor and affection are shown forth towards the King; and the Lord, wishing us to offer it in all simplicity and innocence, did express Himself thus: "Therefore, when you offerest your gift upon the altar, and shall remember that your brother has ought against you, leave your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then return and offer your gift."(10) We are bound, therefore, to offer to God the first-fruits of His creation, as Moses also says, "You shall not appear in the presence of the Lord your God empty;"(11) so that man, being accounted as grateful, by those things in which he has shown his gratitude, may receive that honor which flows from Him.(12)

For the Lord is [ever] one and the same; but the character of a servile oblation is peculiar [to itself], as is also that of freemen, in order that, by the very oblations, the indication of liberty may be set forth.

For the sepulcher appears beautiful outside, but within it is full of dead men's bones, and all uncleanness; even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within you are full of wickedness and hypocrisy."(4) For while they were thought to offer correctly so far as outward appearance went, they had in themselves jealousy like to Cain; therefore they slew the Just One, slighting the counsel of the Word, as did also Cain. For [God] said to him, "Be at rest;" but he did not assent. Now what else is it to "be at rest" than to forego purposed violence? . . . In order, therefore, that their inner wish and thought, being brought to light, may show that God is without blame, and works no evil--that God who reveals what is hidden [in the heart], but who works not evil--when Cain was by no means at rest, He says to him: "To you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him."(8) Thus did He in like manner speak to Pilate: "You shouldest have no power at all against Me, unless it were given you from above;"(9) God always giving up the righteous one [in this life to suffering], that he, having been tested by what he suffered and endured, may [at last] be accepted; but that the evildoer, being judged by the actions he has performed, may be rejected.

"For those things that are impossible with men, are possible with God."(3) For man does not see God by his own powers; but when He pleases He is seen by men, by whom He wills, and when He wills, and as He wills.

But His Word, as He Himself willed it, and for the benefit of those who beheld, did show the Father's brightness, and explained His purposes (as also the Lord said: "The only-begotten God, which is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him];" and He does Himself also interpret the Word of the Father as being rich and great);

For at one time He was seen with those who were around Ananias, Azarias, Misael, as present with them in the furnace of fire, in the burning, and preserving them from [the effects of] fire: "And the appearance of the fourth," it is said, "was like to the Son of God."(5) At another time [He is represented as] "a stone cut out of the mountain without hands,"(6) and as smiting all temporal kingdoms, and as blowing them away (ventilans ea), and as Himself filling all the earth. Then, too, is this same individual beheld as the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, and drawing near to the Ancient of Days, and receiving from Him all power and glory, and a kingdom.

John also, the Lord's disciple, when beholding the sacerdotal and glorious advent of His kingdom, says in the Apocalypse: "I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.   . . . For in these words He sets forth something of the glory [which He has received] from His Father, as [where He makes mention of] the head; something in reference to the priestly office also, as in the case of the long garment reaching to the feet. And this was the reason why Moses vested the high priest after this fashion. Something also alludes to the end [of all things], as [where He speaks of] the fine brass burning in the fire, which denotes the power of faith, and the continuing instant in prayer, because of the consuming fire which is to come at the end of time.   location 16620

But when John could not endure the sight (for he says, "I fell at his feet as dead;"(9) that what was written might come to pass: "No man sees God, and shall live"(10)), and the Word reviving him, and reminding him that it was He upon whose bosom he had leaned at supper, when he put the question as to who should betray Him, declared: "I am the first and the last, and He who liveth, and was dead, and behold I am alive forevermore, and have the keys of death and of hell."

12. However, it was not by means of visions alone which were seen, and words which were proclaimed, but also in actual works, that He was beheld by the prophets, in order that through them He might prefigure and show forth future events beforehand. For this reason did Hosea the prophet take "a wife of whoredoms," prophesying by means of the action, "that in committing fornication the earth should fornicate from the Lord," that is, the men who are upon the earth; and from men of this stamp it will be God's good pleasure to take out a Church which shall be sanctified by fellowship with His Son, just as that woman was sanctified by intercourse with the prophet. And for this reason, Paul declares that the "unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband."   location 16642

Then again, the prophet names his children, "Not having obtained mercy," and "Not a people," in order that, as says the apostle, "what was not a people may become a people; and she who did not obtain mercy may obtain mercy; and she who did not obtain mercy may obtain mercy. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said, This is not a people, there shall they be called the children of the living God."(6) That which had been done typically through his actions by the prophet, the apostle proves to have been done truly by Christ in the Church.   location 16643

Thus, too, did Moses also take to wife an Ethiopian woman, whom he thus made an Israelitish one, showing by anticipation that the wild olive tree is grafted into the cultivated olive, and made to partake of its fatness. For as He who was born Christ according to the flesh, had indeed to be sought after by the people in order to be slain, but was to be set free in Egypt, that is, among the Gentiles, to sanctify those who were there in a state of infancy, from whom also He perfected His Church in that place (for Egypt was Gentile from the beginning, as was Ethiopia also); for this reason, by means of the marriage of Moses, was shown forth the marriage of the Word;(7) and by means of the Ethiopian bride, the Church taken from among the Gentiles was made manifest; and those who do detract from, accuse, and deride it, shall not be pure.

Rahab the harlot was preserved, when all was over [in ultimis], together with all her house, through faith of the scarlet sign; as the Lord also declared to those who did not receive His advent,-the Pharisees, no doubt, nullify the sign of the scarlet thread, which meant the Passover, and the redemption and exodus of the people from Egypt,-when He said, "The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before you."   location 16655

But that our faith was also prefigured in Abraham, and that he was the patriarch of our faith, and, as it were, the prophet of it, the apostle has very fully taught, when he says in the Epistle to the Galatians: "He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, [does he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. Know you therefore, that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. But the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, announced beforehand unto Abraham, that in him all nations should be blessed. So then they which be of faith shall be blessed with faithful Abraham."(10) For which [reasons the apostle] declared that this man was not only the prophet of faith, but also the father of those who from among the Gentiles believe in Jesus Christ, because his faith and ours are one and the same: for he believed in things future, as if they were already accomplished, because of the promise of God; and in like manner do we also, because of the promise of God, behold through faith that inheritance [laid up for us] in the [future] kingdom.

From which it is evident, that not only [were there] prophecies of the patriarchs, but also that the children brought forth by Rebecca were a prediction of the two nations; and that the one should be indeed the greater, but the other the less; that the one also should be under bondage, but the other free; but [that both should be] of one and the same father. Our God, one and the same, is also their God, who knows hidden things, who knows all things before they can come to pass; and for this reason has He said, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."   location 16669

3. If anyone, again, will look into Jacob's actions, he shall find them not destitute of meaning, but full of import with regard to the dispensations. Thus, in the first place, at his birth, since he laid hold on his brother's heel,(4) he was called Jacob, that is, the supplanter--one who holds, but is not held; binding the feet, but not being bound; striving and conquering; grasping in his hand his adversary's heel, that is, victory. For to this end was the Lord born, the type of whose birth he set forth beforehand, of whom also John says in the Apocalypse: "He went forth conquering, that He should conquer."(5) In the next place, [Jacob] received the rights of the first-born, when his brother looked on them with contempt; even as also the younger nation received Him, Christ, the first-begotten, when the elder nation rejected Him, saying, "We have no king but Caesar."(6) But in Christ every blessing [is summed up], and therefore the latter people has snatched away the blessings of the former from the Father, just as Jacob took away the blessing of this Esau. For which cause his brother suffered the plots and persecutions of a brother, just as the Church suffers this self-same thing from the Jews.  location 16677

He administered food to them in a recumbent posture, indicating that those who were lying in the earth were they to whom He came to impart life. As Jeremiah declares, "The holy Lord remembered His dead Israel, who slept in the land of sepulture; and He descended to them to make known to them His salvation, that they might be saved."*(1) For this reason also were the eyes of the disciples weighed down when Christ's passion was approaching; and when, in the first instance, the Lord found them sleeping, He let it pass,--thus indicating the patience of God in regard to the state of slumber in which men lay; but coming the second time, He aroused them, and made them stand up, in token that His passion is the arousing of His sleeping disciples, on whose account "He also descended into the lower parts of the earth,"(2) to behold with His eyes the state of those who were resting from their labors,(3) in reference to whom He did also declare to the disciples: "Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see and hear what you do see and hear."(4) 2. For it was not merely for those who believed on Him in the time of Tiberius Caesar that Christ came, nor did the Father exercise His providence for the men only who are now alive, but for all men altogether, who from the beginning, according to their capacity, in their generation have both feared and loved God, and practiced justice and piety towards their neighbors, and have earnestly desired to see Christ, and to hear His voice.

1. For which reason the Lord declared to the disciples: "Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look upon the districts (regiones), for they are white [already] to harvest. For the harvest- man receives wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. For in this is the saying true, that one soweth and another reapeth. For I have sent you forward to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor; other men have labored, and you have entered into their labors."(6) Who, then, are they that have labored, and have helped forward the dispensations of God? It is clear that they are the patriarchs and prophets, who even prefigured our faith, and disseminated through the earth the advent of the Son of God, who and what He should be: so that posterity, possessing the fear of God, might easily accept the advent of Christ, having been instructed by the prophets. location 16722

It is clear that they are the patriarchs and prophets, who even prefigured our faith, and disseminated through the earth the advent of the Son of God, who and what He should be: so that posterity, possessing the fear of God, might easily accept the advent of Christ, having been instructed by the prophets. And for this reason it was, that when Joseph became aware that Mary was with child, and was minded to put her away privily, the angel said to him in sleep: "Fear not to take to you Mary your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. For she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins."(7) And exhorting him [to this], he added: "Now all this has been done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and His name shall be called Emmanuel;" thus influencing him by the words of the prophet, and warding off blame from Mary, pointing out that it was she who was the virgin mentioned by Isaiah beforehand, who should give birth to Emmanuel. Wherefore, when Joseph was convinced beyond all doubt, he both did take Mary, and joyfully yielded obedience in regard to all the rest of the education of Christ, undertaking a journey into Egypt and back again, and then a removal to Nazareth. location 16728

2. For this reason, also, Philip, when he had discovered the eunuch of the Ethiopians' queen reading these words which had been written: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away;"(10) and all the rest which the prophet proceeded to relate in regard to His passion and His coming in the flesh, and how He was dishonored by those who did not believe Him; easily persuaded him to believe on Him, that He was Christ Jesus, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate, and suffered whatsoever the prophet had predicted, and that He was the Son of God, who gives eternal life to men. And immediately when [Philip] had baptized him, he departed from him. For nothing else [but baptism] was wanting to him who had been already instructed by the prophets: he was not ignorant of God the Father, nor of the rules as to the [proper] manner of life, but was merely ignorant of the advent of the Son of God, which, when he had become acquainted with, in a short space of time, he went on his way rejoicing, to be the herald in Ethiopia of Christ's advent.

But although they who were of the circumcision still did not obey the words of God, for they were despisers, yet they were previously instructed not to commit adultery, nor fornication, nor theft, nor fraud; and that whatsoever things are done to our neighbors' prejudice, were evil, and detested by God.

But they were bound to teach the Gentiles also this very thing, that works of such a nature were wicked, prejudicial, and useless, and destructive to those who engaged in them. Wherefore he who had received the apostolate to the Gentiles,(3) did labor more than those who preached the Son of God among them of the circumcision. For they were assisted by the Scriptures, which the Lord confirmed and fulfilled, in coming such as He had been announced; but here, [in the case of the Gentiles,] there was a certain foreign erudition, and a new doctrine [to be received, namely], that the gods of the nations not only were no gods at all, but even the idols of demons; and that there is one God, who is "above all principality, and dominion, and power, and every name which is named;"(4) and that His Word, invisible by nature, was made palpable and visible among men, and did descend "to death, even the death of the cross;"(5) also, that they who believe in Him shall be incorruptible and not subject to suffering, and shall receive the kingdom of heaven. These things, too, were preached to the Gentiles by word, without [the aid of] the Scriptures: wherefore, also, they who preached among the Gentiles underwent greater labor.

For when she had conceived twins, one of them put forth his hand first; and as the midwife supposed that he was the first-born, she bound a scarlet token on his hand. But after this had been done, and he had drawn back his hand, his brother Phares came forth the first; then, after him, Zara, upon whom was the scarlet line, [was born] the second: the Scripture clearly pointing out that people which possessed the scarlet sign, that is, faith in a state of circumcision, which was shown beforehand, indeed, in the patriarchs first; but after that withdrawn, that his brother might be born; and also, in like manner, him who was the elder, as being born in the second place, [him] who was distinguished by the scarlet token which was [fastened] on him, that is, the passion of the Just One, which was prefigured from the beginning in Abel, and described by the prophets, but perfected in the last times in the Son of God.   location 16783

For although Abraham was one, he did in himself prefigure the two covenants, in which some indeed have sown, while others have reaped; for it is said, "In this is the saying true, that it is one 'people' who sows, but another who shall reap;"(4) but it is one God who bestows things suitable upon both--seed to the sower, but bread for the reaper to eat. Just as it is one that plants, and another who waters, but one God who giveth the increase.(5) For the patriarchs and prophets sowed the word [concerning] Christ, but the Church reaped, that is, received the fruit. For this reason, too, do these very men (the prophets) also pray to have a dwelling-place in it, as Jeremiah says, "Who will give me in the desert the last dwelling-place?"(6) in order that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together in the kingdom of Christ, who is present with all those who were from the beginning approved by God, who granted them His Word to be present with them.(7)   location 16795

For Christ is the treasure which was hid in the field,(8) that is, in this world (for "the field is the world"(9); but the treasure hid in the Scriptures is Christ, since He was pointed out by means of types and parables. Hence His human nature could not(10) be understood, prior to the consummation of those things which had been predicted, that is, the advent of Christ. And therefore it was said to Daniel the prophet: "Shut up the words, and seal the book even to the time of consummation, until many learn, and knowledge be completed. For at that time, when the dispersion shall be accomplished, they shall know all these things."(11) But Jeremiah also says, "In the last days they shall understand these things."(12)

But when the time has arrived, and the prediction has come to pass, then the prophecies have a clear and certain exposition. And for this reason, indeed, when at this present time the Law is read to the Jews, it is like a fable; for they do not possess the explanation of all things pertaining to the advent of the Son of God, which took place in human nature; but when it is read by the Christians, it is a treasure, hid indeed in a field, but brought to light by the cross of Christ, and explained, both enriching the understanding of men, and showing forth the wisdom of God and declaring His dispensations with regard to man, and forming the kingdom of Christ beforehand, and preaching by anticipation the inheritance of the holy Jerusalem, and proclaiming beforehand that the man who loves God shall arrive at such excellency as even to see God, and hear His word   location 16810

But [it is also incumbent] to hold in suspicion others who depart from the primitive succession, and assemble themselves together in any place whatsoever, [looking upon them] either as heretics of perverse minds, or as schismatics puffed up and self-pleasing,   location 16819

Those, however, who are believed to be presbyters by many, but serve their own lusts, and, do not place the fear of God supreme in their hearts, but conduct themselves with contempt towards others, and are puffed up with the pride of holding the chief seat, and work evil deeds in secret, saying, "No man sees us," shall be convicted by the Word, who does not judge after outward appearance. . . . Of whom also did the Lord say: "But if the evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming, and shall begin to smite the man-servants and maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken; the lord of that servant shall come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."   location 16827

Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He comes, shall find so doing."(5) Paul then, teaching us where one may find such, says, "God has placed in the Church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers."(6) Where, therefore, the gifts of the Lord have been placed, there it behoves us to learn the truth, [namely,] from those who possess that succession of the Church which is from the apostles? and among whom exists that which is sound and blameless in conduct, as well as that which is unadulterated and incorrupt in speech. location 16850

{Rom 2:12-16; 2 Tim 2:2; 2 Sam 11:27; 1 Pet 3:19; Rom 3:23; Descent into Hades}
As I have heard from a certain presbyter, who had heard it from those who had seen the apostles, and from those who had been their disciples, the punishment [declared] in Scripture was sufficient for the ancients in regard to what they did without the Spirit's guidance. . . . David had done appeared wicked in the eyes of the Lord;" and Nathan the prophet is sent to him, pointing out to him his crime, in order that he, passing sentence upon and condemning himself, might obtain mercy and forgiveness from Christ. . . .And the Lord was angry with Solomon; for his heart was not perfect with the Lord, as was the heart of David his father."(4) The Scripture has thus sufficiently reproved him [Solomon], as the presbyter remarked, in order that no flesh may glory in the sight of the Lord.  2. It was for this reason, too, that the Lord descended into the regions beneath the earth, preaching His advent there also, and [declaring] the remission of sins received by those who believe in Him. Now all those believed in Him who had hope towards Him, that is, those who proclaimed His advent, and submitted to His dispensations, the righteous men, the prophets, and the patriarchs, to whom He remitted sins in the same way as He did to us, which sins we should not lay to their charge, if we would not despise the grace of God. For as these men did not impute unto us (the Gentiles) our transgressions, which we wrought before Christ was manifested among us, so also it is not right that we should lay blame upon those who sinned before Christ's coming. For "all men come short of the glory of God," and are not justified of themselves, but by the advent of the Lord,-they who earnestly direct their eyes towards His light. And it is for our instruction that their actions have been committed to writing, that we might know, in the first place, that our God and theirs is one, and that sins do not please Him although committed by men of renown; and in the second place, that we should keep from wickedness.   location 16894

{Heb 10:28-29; Heb 6:4-6; Mt 25:14-15; Rom 11:21; Rom 11:17}
For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord's coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing and remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who now commit sin, for death shall no more have dominion over Him; but the Son shall come in the glory of the Father, requiring from His stewards and dispensers the money which He had entrusted to them, with usury; and from those to whom He had given most shall He demand most. We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom.(6) And therefore it was that Paul said, "For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not you, who, when you wert a wild olive tree, were grafted into the fatness of the olive tree, and were made a partaker of its fatness."  location 16902

as, in the former case, God showed Himself not well pleased in many stances towards those who sinned, so also in the latter, "many are called, but few are chosen."(3) As then the unrighteous, the idolaters, and fornicators perished, so also is it now: for both the Lord declares, that such persons are sent into eternal fire;(4) and the apostle says, "Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, not effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."(5) And as it was not to those who are without that he said these things, but to us. lest we should be cast forth from the kingdom of God, by doing any such thing, he proceeds to say, "And such indeed were you; but you are washed, but you are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God." And just as then, those who led vicious lives, and put other people astray, were condemned and cast out, so also even now the offending eYou is plucked out, and the foot and the hand, lest the rest of the body perish in like manner.(6) And we have the precept: "If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a person no not to eat."(7) And again does the apostle say, "Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things comes the wrath of God upon the sons of mistrust. Be not you therefore par- takers with them."(8) And as then the condemnation of sinners extended to others who approved of them, and joined in their society; so also is it the case at present, that "a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump."(9)   location 16937

For to whomsoever the Lord shall say, "Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire," these shall be damned forever; and to whomsoever He shall say, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you for eternity," these do receive the kingdom forever, and make constant advance in it; since there is one and the same God the Father, and His Word, who has been always present with the human race   location 16960

1. "But," say they, "God hardened the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants."(5) Those, then, who allege such difficulties, do not read in the Gospel that passage where the Lord replied to the disciples, when they asked Him, "Why speakest you unto them in parables?"--"Because it is given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven; but to thorn I speak in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not hear, understanding they may not understand; in order that the prophecy of Isaiah regarding them may be fulfil leading, Make the heart of this people gross and make their ears dull, and blind their eyes. But blessed are your eyes, which see the things that you see; and your ears, which hear what you do hear.(6) For one and the same God [that blesses others] inflicts blindness upon those who do not believe, but who set Him at naught; just as the sun, which is a creature of His, [acts with regard] to those who, by reason of any weakness of the eyes cannot behold his light; but to those who believe in Him and follow Him, He grants a fuller and greater illumination of mind. In accordance with this word, therefore, does the apostle say, in the Second the] to the Corinthians: "In whom the this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine [unto them]."(7) And again, in that to the Romans: "And as they did not think fit to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things that are not convenient."(8) Speaking of antichrist, too, he says clearly in the Second to the Thessalonians: "And for this cause God shall send them the working of error, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but consented to iniquity."(9)
2. If, therefore, in the present time also, God, knowing the number of those who will not believe, since He foreknows all things, has given them over to unbelief, and turned away His face from men of this stamp, leaving them in the darkness which they have themselves chosen for themselves, what is there wonderful if He did also at that time give over to their unbelief, Pharaoh, who never would have believed, along with those who were with him? As the Word spoke to Moses from the bush: "And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, unless by a mighty hand."(10) And for the reason that the Lord spoke in parables, and brought blindness upon Israel, that seeing they might not see, since He knew the [spirit of] unbelief in them, for the same reason did He harden Pharaoh's heart; in order that, while seeing that it was the finger of God which led forth the people, he might not believe, but be precipitated into a sea of unbelief, resting in the notion that the exit of these [Israelites] was accomplished by magical power, and that it was not by the operation of God that the Red Sea afforded a passage to the people, but that this occurred by merely natural causes.    location 16993

1. Those, again, who cavil and find fault because the people did, by God's command, upon the eve of their departure, take vessels of all kinds and raiment from the Egyptians," and so went away, from which [spoils], too, the tabernacle was constructed in the wilderness, prove themselves ignorant of the righteous dealings of God, and of His dispensations; as also the presbyter remarked: For if God had not accorded this in the typical exodus, no one could now be saved in our true exodus; that is, in the faith in which we have been established, and by which we have been brought forth from among the number of the Gentiles. For in some cases there follows us a small, and in others a large amount of property, which we have acquired from the mammon of unrighteousness.  . . . The Egyptians were debtors to the [Jewish] people, not alone as to property, but as their very lives, because of the kindness of the patriarch Joseph in former times. . . .
2. Up to that time the people served the Egyptians in the most abject slavery, as says the Scripture: "And the Egyptians exercised their power rigorously upon the children of Israel; and they made life bitter to them by severe labors, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field which they did, by all the works in which they oppressed them with rigor."(1) And with immense labor they built for them fenced cities, increasing the substance of these men throughout a long course of years, and by means of every species of slavery; while these [masters] were not only ungrateful towards them, but had in contemplation their utter annihilation. In what way, then, did [the Israelites] act unjustly, if out of many things they took a few, they who might have possessed much property had they not served them, and might have gone forth wealthy, while, in fact, by receiving only a very insignificant recompense for their heavy servitude, they went away poor? It is just as if any free man, being forcibly carried away by another, and serving him for many years, and increasing his substance, should be thought, when he ultimately obtains some support, to possess some small portion of his [master's] property, but should in reality depart, having obtained only a little as the result of his own great labors, and out of vast possessions which have been acquired, and this should be made by anyone a subject of accusation against him, as if he had not acted properly.(2) He (the accuser) will rather appear as an unjust judge against him who had been forcibly carried away into slavery. Of this kind, then, are these men also, who charge the people with blame, because they appropriated a few things out of many, but who bring no charge against those who did not render them the recompense due to their fathers' services; nay, but even reducing them to the most burdensome slavery, obtained the highest profit from them.     location 17013

In in some cases there follows us a small, and in others a large amount of property, which we have acquired from the mammon of unrighteousness.

For who is there that sells, and does not wish to make a profit from him who buys? Or who purchases anything, and does not wish to obtain good value from the seller?

1. When recounting certain matters of this kind respecting them of old time, the presbyter [before mentioned] was in the habit of instructing us, and saying: "With respect to those misdeeds for which the Scriptures themselves blame the patriarchs and prophets, we ought not to inveigh against them, nor become like Ham, who ridiculed the shame of his father, and so fell under a curse; but we should [rather] give thanks to God in their behalf, inasmuch as their sins have been forgiven them through the advent of our Lord; for He said that they gave thanks [for us], and gloried in our salvation. With respect to those actions, again, on which the Scriptures pass no censure, but which are simply set down [as having occurred], we ought not to become the accusers [of those who committed them], for we are not more exact than God, nor can we be superior to our Master; but we should search for a type [in them].

{Lot; Gen 19:33-38}
With respect to those actions, again, on which the Scriptures pass no censure, but which are simply set down [as having occurred], we ought not to become the accusers [of those who committed them], for we are not more exact than God, nor can we be superior to our Master; but we should search for a type [in theme. For not one of those things which have been set down in Scripture without being condemned is without significance." An example is found in the case of Lot, who led forth his daughters from Sodom, and these then conceived by their own father; and who left behind him within the confines [of the land] his wife, [who remains] a pillar of salt unto this day. For Lot, not acting under the impulse of his own will, nor at the prompting of carnal concupiscence, nor having any knowledge or thought of anything of the kind, did [in fact] work out a type [of future events]. As says the Scripture: "And that night the eider went in and lay with her father; and Lot knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose." And the same thing took place in the case of the younger: "And he knew not," it is said, "when she slept with him, nor when she arose." Since, therefore, Lot knew not [what he did], nor was a slave to lust [in his actions], the arrangement [designed by God] was carried out, by which the two daughters (that is, the two churches), who gave birth to children begotten of one and the same father, were pointed out, apart from [the influence of] the lust of the flesh. For there was no other person, [as they supposed], who could impart to them quickening seed, and the means of their giving birth to children, as it is written: "And the elder said unto the younger, And there is not a man on the earth to enter in unto us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, and raise up seed from our father."(4)
2. Thus, after their simplicity and innocence, did these daughters [of Lot] so speak, imagining that all mankind had perished, even as the Sodomites had done, and that the anger of God had come down upon the whole earth. Wherefore also they are to be held excusable, since they supposed that they only, along with their father, were left for the preservation of the human race; and for this reason it was that they deceived their father. Moreover, by the words they used this fact was pointed out--that there is no other one who can confer upon the elder and younger church the [power of] giving birth to children, besides our Father. Now the father of the human race is the Word of God. . . . Now this whole matter was indicated through Lot, that the seed of the Father of all-that is, of the Spirit of God, by whom all things were made-was commingled and united with flesh-that is, with His own workmanship; by which commixture and unity the two synagogues-that is, the two churches-produced from their own father living sons to the living God.   location 17102

Jeremiah, too, makes this point still clearer, when he thus speaks concerning Jerusalem: "She that has born [seven] languishes; her soul has become weary; her sun has gone down while it was yet noon; she has been confounded, and suffered reproach: the remainder of them will I give to the sword in the sight of their enemies."   location 17269

For all indeed prophesied as to the sufferings of Christ, but they themselves were far from enduring sufferings similar to what was predicted. And the points connected with the passion of the Lord, which were foretold, were realized in no other case. For neither did it happen at the death of any man among the ancients that the sun set at mid-day, nor was the veil of the temple rent, nor did the earth quake, nor were the rocks rent, nor did the dead rise up, nor was anyone of these men [of old] raised up on the third day, nor received into heaven, nor at his assumption were the heavens opened, nor did the nations believe in the name of any other; nor did any from among them, having been dead and rising again, lay open the new covenant of liberty. Therefore the prophets spoke not of anyone else but of the Lord, in whom all these aforesaid tokens concurred.

from the Lord's advent, the new covenant which brings back peace, and the law which gives life, has gone forth over the whole earth, as the prophets said: "For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; and He shall rebuke many people; and they shall break down their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks, and they shall no longer learn to fight."(1) If therefore another law and word, going forth from Jerusalem, brought in such a [reign of] peace among the Gentiles which received it (the word), and convinced, through them, many a nation of its folly, then [only] it appears that the prophets spoke of some other person. But if the law of liberty, that is, the word of God, preached by the apostles (who went forth from Jerusalem) throughout all the earth, caused such a change in the state of things, that these [nations] did form the swords and war-lances into ploughshares, and changed them into pruning-hooks for reaping the corn, [that is], into instruments used for peaceful purposes, and that they are now unaccustomed to fighting, but when smitten, offer also the other cheek,(2) then the prophets have not spoken these things of any other person, but of Him who effected them. This person is our Lord, and in Him is that declaration borne out; since it is He Himself who has made the plough, and introduced the pruning-hook, that is, the first semination of man, which was the creation exhibited in Adam,(3) and the gathering in of the produce in the last times by the Word; and, for this reason, since He joined the beginning to the end, and is the Lord of both, He has finally displayed the plough, in that the wood has been joined on to the iron, and has thus cleansed His land because the Word having been firmly united to flesh, and in its mechanism fixed with pins,(4) has reclaimed the savage earth. In the beginning, He figured forth the pruning-hook by means of Abel, pointing out that there should be a gathering in of a righteous race of men. He says, "For behold how the just man perishes, and no man considers it; and righteous men are taken away, and no man layeth it to heart."(5) These things were acted beforehand in Abel, were also previously declared by the prophets, but were accomplished in the Lord's person; and the same [is still true] with regard to us, the body following the example of the Head.   location 17339

{Parable of the Vineyard; Mt 21:33-43; Jer 7:29-30; Jer 6:17-18}
For God planted the vineyard of the human race when at the first He formed Adam and chose the fathers; then He let it out to husbandmen when He established the Mosaic dispensation: He hedged it round about, that is, He gave particular instructions with regard to their worship: He built a tower, [that is], He chose Jerusalem: He dug a winepress, that is, He prepared a receptacle of the prophetic Spirit. And thus did He send prophets prior to the transmigration to Babylon, and after that event others again in greater number than the former, to seek the fruits, saying thus to them (the Jews): "Thus says the Lord, Cleanse your ways and your doings, execute just judgment, and look each one with pity and compassion on his brother: oppress not the widow nor the orphan, the proselyte nor the poor, and let none of you treasure up evil against his brother in your hearts, and love not false Oaths. Wash you, make you clean, put away evil from your hearts, learn to do well, seek judgment, protect the oppressed, judge the fatherless (purillo), plead for the widow; and come, let us reason together, says the Lord."(2) (Jer 7:3; Zech 7:9-10; Isa 1:17-19) And again: "Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips that they speak no guile; depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it."(Ps 34:13-14) In preaching these things, the prophets sought the fruits of righteousness. But last of all He sent to those unbelievers His own Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, whom the wicked husbandmen cast out of the vineyard when they had slain Him. Wherefore the Lord God did even give it up (no longer hedged around, but thrown open throughout all the world) to other husbandmen, who render the fruits in their seasons,--the beautiful elect tower being also raised everywhere. For the illustrious Church is [now] everywhere, and everywhere is i the winepress dug: because those who do receive the Spirit are everywhere. For inasmuch as the former have rejected the Son of God, and cast Him out of the vineyard when they slew Him, God has justly rejected them, and given to the Gentiles outside the vineyard the fruits of its cultivation. This is in accordance with what Jeremiah says, "The Lord has rejected and cast off the nation which does these things; for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, says the Lord."(Jer 7:29-30) And again in like manner does Jeremiah speak: "I set watchmen over you; hearken to the sound of the trumpet; and they said, We will not hearken. Therefore have the Gentiles heard, and they who feed the flocks in them."(Jer 6:17-18) It is therefore one and the same Father who planted the vineyard, who led forth the people, who sent the prophets, who sent His own Son, and who gave the vineyard to those other husbandmen that render the fruits in their season.

{Parable of the Wedding Feast; Mt 22:2-14; Rom 13:1-2}
But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man not having on a wedding garment; and he said unto him, Friend, how camest you hither, not having on a wedding garment? But he was speechless. Then said the king to his servants, Take him away, hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen."(8) Now, by these words of His, does the Lord clearly show all [these points, viz.,] that there is one King and Lord, the Father of all, of whom He had previously said, "Neither shall you swear by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;"(9) and that He had from the beginning prepared the marriage for His Son, and used, with the utmost kindness, to call, by the instrumentality of His servants, the men of the former dispensation to the wedding feast; and when they would not obey, He still invited them by sending out other servants, yet that even then they did not obey Him, but even stoned and slew those who brought them the message of invitation. He accordingly sent forth His armies and destroyed them, and burned down their city; but He called together from all the highways, that is, from all nations, [guests] to the marriage feast of His Son. . . . 6. Still further did He also make it manifest, that we ought, after our calling, to be also adorned with works of righteousness, so that the Spirit of God may rest upon us; for this is the wedding garment, of which also the apostle speaks, "Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up by immortality."(3) But those who have indeed been called to God's supper, yet have not received the Holy Spirit, because of their wicked conduct "shall be," He declares, "cast into outer darkness."(4) He thus clearly shows that the very same King who gathered from all quarters the faithful to the marriage of His Son, and who grants them the incorruptible banquet, [also] orders that man to be cast into outer darkness who has not on a wedding garment, that is, one who despises it. For as in the former covenant, "with many of them was He not well pleased;"(5) so also is it the case here, that "many are called, but few chosen."(6) It is not, then, one God who judges, and another Father who calls us together to salvation; nor one, in fact, who confers eternal light, but another who orders those who have not on the wedding garment to be sent into outer darkness. But it is one and the same God, the Father of our Lord, from whom also the prophets had their mission, who does indeed, through His infinite kindness, call the unworthy; but He examines those who are called, [to ascertain] if they have on the garment fit and proper for the marriage of His Son, because nothing unbecoming or evil pleases Him. This is in accordance with what the Lord said to the man who had been healed: "Behold, You are made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you."(7) For he who is good, and righteous, and pure, and spotless, will endure nothing evil, nor unjust, nor detestable in His wedding chamber. This is the Father of our Lord, by whose providence all things consist, and all are administered by His command; and He confers His free gifts upon those who should [receive them]; but the most righteous Retributor metes out [punishment] according to their deserts, most deservedly, to the ungrateful and to those that are insensible of His kindness; and therefore does He say, "He sent His armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city."(8) He says here, "His armies," because all men are the property of God. For "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein."(9) Wherefore also the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Romans, "For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.

7. And not alone by what has been stated, but also by the parable of the two sons, the younger of whom consumed his substance by living luxuriously with harlots, did the Lord teach one and the same Father, who did not even allow a kid to his elder son; but for him who had been lost, [namely] his younger son, he ordered the fatted calf to be killed, and he gave him the best robe.

{Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard; Mt 20:1-15}
Also by the parable of the workmen who were sent into the vineyard at different periods of the day, one and the same God is declared(1) as having called some in the beginning, when the world was first created; but others afterwards, and others during the intermediate period, others after a long lapse of time, and others again in the end of time; so that there are many workmen in their generations, but only one householder who calls them together. For there is but one vineyard, since there is also but one righteousness, and one dispensator, for there is one Spirit of God who arranges all things; and in like manner is there one hire, for they all received a penny each man, having [stamped upon it] the royal image and superscription, the knowledge of the Son of God, which is immortality. And therefore He began by giving the pay to those [who were engaged] last, because in the last times, when 'the Lord was revealed He presented Himself to all [as their reward].

{Lk 13:6; Mt 23:37}
Then, again, this truth was clearly shown forth by the parable of the fig-tree, of which the Lord says, "Behold, now these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, but I find none"(5) (pointing onwards, by the prophets, to His advent, by whom He came from time to time, seeking the fruit of righteousness from them, which he did not find), and also by the circumstance that, for the reason already mentioned, the fig- tree should be hewn down. And, without using a parable, the Lord said to Jerusalem, 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that killest the prophets, and stones those that are sent unto you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her chickens trader her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate."(6) For that which had been said in the parable, "Behold, for three years I come seeking fruit," and in clear terms, again, [where He says]," How often would I have gathered your children together," shall be [found] a falsehood, if we do not understand His advent, which is [announced] by the prophets--if, in fact, He came to them but once, and then for the first time. But since He who chose the patriarchs and those [who lived under the first covenant], is the same Word of God who did both visit them through the prophetic Spirit, and us also who have been called together from all quarters by His advent

{Free Will; Obedience, Role in Salvation; Mt 23:37; Rom 2:4-7}
1. This expression [of our Lord], "How often would I have gathered your children together, and you wouldest not,"(8) set forth the ancient law of human liberty, because God made man a free [agent] from the beginning, possessing his own power, even as he does his own soul, to obey the behests of God voluntarily, and not by compulsion of God. For there is no coercion with God, but a good will [towards us] is present with Him continually. And therefore does He give good counsel to all. And in man, as well as in angels, He has placed the power of choice (for angels are rational beings), so that those who had yielded obedience might justly possess what is good, given indeed by God, but preserved by themselves. On the other hand, they who have not obeyed shall, with justice, be not found in possession of the good, and shall receive condign punishment: for God did kindly bestow on them what was good; but they themselves did not diligently keep it, nor deem it something precious, but poured contempt upon His super- eminent goodness. Rejecting therefore the good, and as it were spewing it out, they shall all deservedly incur the just judgment of God, which also the Apostle Paul testifies in his Epistle to the Romans, where he says, "But do you despise the riches of His goodness, and patience, and long- suffering, being ignorant that the goodness of God leadeth you to repentance? But according to your hardness and impenitent heart, you treasurest to yourself wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God." "But glory and honor," he says, "to everyone that does good."(1) God therefore has given that which is good, as the apostle tells us in this Epistle, and they who work it shall receive glory and honor, because they have done that which is good when they had it in their power not to do it; but those who do it not shall receive the just judgment of God, because they did not work good when they had it in their power so to do.
2. But if some had been made by nature bad, and others good, these latter would not be deserving of praise for being good, for such were they created; nor would the former be reprehensible, for thus they were made [originally]. But since all men are of the same nature, able both to hold fast and to do what is good; and, on the other hand, having also the power to cast it from them and not to do it,--some do justly receive praise even among men who are under the control of good laws (and much more from God), and obtain deserved testimony of their choice of good in general, and of persevering therein; but the others are blamed, and receive a just condemnation, because of their rejection of what is fair and good. And therefore the prophets used to exhort men to what was good, to act justly and to work righteousness, as I have so largely demonstrated, because it is in our power so to do.

{Free Will; Mt 5:16; Lk 21:34}
3. For this reason the Lord also said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good deeds, and glorify your Father who is in heaven." And, "Take heed to yourselves, lest perchance your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and worldly cares." . . . All such passages demonstrate the independent will of man, and at the same time the counsel which God conveys to him, by which He exhorts us to submit ourselves to Him, and seeks to turn us away from [the sin of] unbelief against Him, without, however, in any way coercing us.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk. 4, ch. 37, par 3

{Free Will; Eph 4:25; Eph 4:29; 1 Cor 6:11}
he says, "Speak you every man truth with his neighbor."(11) And, "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor scurrility, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks."(12) And, "For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord; walk honestly as children of the light, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in anger and jealousy. And such were some of you; but you have been washed, but you have been sanctified in the name of our Lord."(13) If then it were not in our power to do or not to do these things, what reason had the apostle, and much more the Lord Himself, to give us counsel to do some things, and to abstain from others? But because man is possessed of free will from the beginning, and God is possessed of free will, in whose likeness man was created, advice is always given to him to keep fast the good, which thing is done by means of obedience to God.

{Free Will; Mk 9:23; Mt 8:13; Jn 3:36}
5. And not merely in works, but also in faith, has God preserved the will of man free and under his own control, saying, "According to your faith be it unto you; "(1) thus showing that there is a faith specially belonging to man, since he has an opinion specially his own. And again, "All things are possible to him that believeth;"(2) and, "Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done unto you."(3) Now all such expressions demonstrate that man is in his own power with respect to faith. And for this reason, "he that believeth in Him has eternal life while he who believeth not the Son has not eternal life, but the wrath of God shall remain upon him."(4)

6. Those, again, who maintain the opposite to these ['conclusions], do themselves present the Lord as destitute of power, as if, in fact, He were unable to accomplish what He willed; or, on the other hand, as being ignorant that they were by nature "material," as these men express it, and such as cannot receive His immortality. "But He should not," say they, "have created angels of such a nature that they were capable of transgression, nor men who immediately proved ungrateful towards Him." For they were made rational beings, endowed with the power of examining and judging, and were not [formed] as things irrational or of a [merely] animal nature, which can do nothing of their own will, but are drawn by necessity and compulsion to what is good, in which things there is one mind and one usage, working mechanically in one groove, who are incapable of being anything else except just what they had been created.

7. On this account, too, did the Lord assert that the kingdom of heaven was the portion of "the violent;" and He says, "The violent take it by force;"(6) that is, those who by strength and earnest striving are on the watch to snatch it away on the moment. On this account also Paul the Apostle says to the Corinthians, "Know you not, that they who run in a racecourse, do all indeed run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain. Everyone also who engages in the contest is temperate in all things: now these men [do it] that they may obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. But I so run, not as uncertainty; I fight, not as One beating the air; but I make my body livid, and bring it into subjection, lest by any means, when preaching to others, I may myself be rendered a castaway."(7) This able wrestler, therefore, exhorts us to the struggle for immortality, that we may be crowned, and may deem the crown precious, namely, that which is acquired by our struggle, but which does not encircle us of its own accord. And the harder we strive, so much is it the more valuable; while so much the more valuable it is, so much the more should we esteem it. And indeed those things are not esteemed so highly which come spontaneously, as those which are reached by much anxious care. Since, then, this power has been conferred upon us, both the Lord has taught and the apostle has enjoined us the more to love God, that we may reach this [prize] for ourselves by striving after it.

{Jer 2:19; God's Plan for Mankind; Imputed Righteousness Refuted}
The prophet says, "Thine own apostasy shall heal you;"(8) God thus determining all things beforehand for the bringing of man to perfection, for his edification, and for the revelation of His dispensations, that goodness may both be made apparent, and righteousness perfected, and that the Church may be fashioned after the image of His Son, and that man may finally be brought to maturity at some future time, becoming ripe through such privileges to see and comprehend God.

By this arrangement, therefore, and these harmonies, and a sequence of this nature, man, a created and organized being, is rendered after the image and likeness of the uncreated God, -the Father planning everything well and giving His commands, the Son carrying these into execution and performing the work of creating, and the Spirit nourishing and increasing [what is made], but man making progress day by day, and ascending towards the perfect, that is, approximating to the uncreated One. For the Uncreated is perfect, that is, God.

{Ps 82:6-7; God's Plan for Man}
For we [i.e., the heretics and unbelievers] cast blame upon Him, because we have not been made gods from the beginning, but at first merely men, then at length gods; although God has adopted this course out of His pure benevolence, that no one may impute to Him invidiousness or grudgingness. He declares, "I have said, you are gods; and you are all sons of the Highest."(1) But since we could not sustain the power of divinity, He adds, "But you shall die like men," setting forth both truths--the kindness of His free gift, and our weakness, and also that we were possessed of power over ourselves. For after His great kindness He graciously conferred good [upon us], and made men like to Himself, [that is] in their own power; while at the same time by His prescience He knew the infirmity of human beings, and the consequences which would flow from it; but through [His] love and [His] power, He shall overcome the substance of created nature.(2) For it was necessary, at first, that nature should be exhibited; then, after that, that what was mortal should be conquered and swallowed up by immortality, and the corruptible by incorruptibility, and that man should be made after the image and likeness of God, having received the knowledge of good and evil.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk. 4, ch. 38, par 4

{Doctrine of Man; Gen 3:5; Obedience, Role in Salvation; God's Plan for Man}
1. Man has received the knowledge of good and evil. It is good to obey God, and to believe in Him, and to keep His commandment, and this is the life of man; as not to obey God is evil, and this is his death. Since God, therefore, gave [to man] such mental power man knew both the good of obedience and the evil of disobedience, that the eYou of the mind, receiving experience of both, may with judgment make choice of the better things; and that he may never become indolent or neglectful of God's command; and learning by experience that it is an evil thing which deprives him of life, that is, disobedience to God, may never attempt it at all, but that, knowing that what preserves his life, namely, obedience to God, is good, he may diligently keep it with all earnestness. Wherefore he has also had a twofold experience, possessing knowledge of both kinds, that with discipline he may make choice of the better things. But how, if he had no knowledge of the contrary, could he have had instruction in that which is good?

{Deification of Man; God's Plan for Man}
2. How, then, shall he be a God, who has not as yet been made a man? Or how can he be perfect who was but lately created? How, again, can he be immortal, who in his mortal nature did not obey his Maker? For it must be that thou, at the outset, shouldest hold the rank of a man, and then afterwards partake of the glory of God. For you do not make God, but God you. If, then, You are God's workmanship, await the hand of your Maker which creates everything in due time; in due time as far as you are concerned, whose creation is being carried out.

{Free Will; Parable of the Wedding Feast; Obedience, Role in Salvation}
3. If, however, you will not believe in Him, and will flee from His hands, the cause of imperfection shall be in you who did not obey, but not in Him who called [you]. For He commissioned [messengers] to call people to the marriage, but they who did not obey Him deprived themselves of the royal supper.(3) The skill of God, therefore, is not defective, for He has power of the stones to raise up children to Abraham;(4) but the man who does not obtain it is the cause to himself of his own imperfection. Nor, [in like manner], does the light fail because of those who have blinded themselves; but while it remains the same as ever, those who are [thus] blinded are involved in darkness through their own fault. The light does never enslave anyone by necessity; nor, again, does God exercise compulsion upon anyone unwilling to accept the exercise of His skill. Those persons, therefore, who have apostatized from the light given by the Father, and transgressed the law of liberty, have done so through their own fault, since they have been created free agents, and possessed of power over themselves.

{Mt. 8:12; Mt 22:13; Mt 25:30}
4. But God, foreknowing all things, prepared fit habitations for both, kindly conferring that light which they desire on those who seek after the light of incorruption, and resort to it; but for the despisers and mockers who avoid and turn themselves away from this light, and who do, as it were, blind themselves, He has prepared darkness suitable to persons who oppose the light, and He has inflicted an appropriate punishment upon those who try to avoid being subject to Him. Submission to God is eternal rest, so that they who shun the light have a place worthy of their flight; and those who fly from eternal rest, have a habitation in accordance with their fleeing. Now, since all good things are with God, they who by their own determination fly from God, do defraud themselves of all good things; and having been [thus] defrauded of all good things with respect to God, they shall consequently fall under the just judgment of God. For those persons who shun rest shall justly incur punishment, and those who avoid the light shall justly dwell in darkness.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk. 4, ch. 39, par 4

{Mt 25:41; Isa 45:7; Obedience, Role in Salvation}
1. It is therefore one and the same God the Father who has prepared good things with Himself for those who desire His fellowship, and who remain in subjection to Him; and who has the eternal fire for the ringleader of the apostasy, the devil, and those who revolted with him, into which [fire] the Lord(5) has declared those men shall be sent who have been set apart by themselves on His left hand. And this is what has been spoken by the prophet, "I am a jealous God, making peace, and creating evil things;"(6) thus making peace and friendship with those who repent and turn to Him, and bringing [them to] unity, but preparing for the impenitent, those who shun the light, eternal fire and outer darkness, which are evils indeed to those persons who fall into them.

{Parable of the Wheat and Tares; Mt 13:36-43; Gen 3:15; Atonement}
3. The Lord, indeed, sowed good seed in His own field;(5) and He says, "The field is the world." But while men slept, the enemy came, and "sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went his way."(6) Hence we learn that this was the apostate angel and the enemy, because he was envious of God's workmanship, and took in hand to render this [workmanship] an enmity with God. For this cause also God has banished from His presence him who did of his own accord stealthily sow the tares, that is, him who brought about the transgression;(7) but He took compassion upon man, who, through want of care no doubt, but still wickedly [on the part of another], became involved in disobedience; and He turned the enmity by which [the devil] had designed to make [man] the enemy of God, against the author of it, by removing His own anger from man, turning it in another direction, and sending it instead upon the serpent. As also the Scripture tells us that God said to the serpent, "And I will place enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He(8) shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."(9) And the Lord summed up in Himself this enmity, when He was made man from a woman, and trod upon his [the serpent's] head.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk. 4, ch. 40, par 3

{Mt 13:38; Jn 8:44; Free Will}
1. Inasmuch as the Lord has said that there are certain angels, [viz. those] of the devil, for whom eternal fire is prepared; and as, again, He declares with regard to the tares, "The tares are the children of the wicked one,"(10) it must be affirmed that He has ascribed all who are of the apostasy to him who is the ringleader of this transgression. But He made neither angels nor men so by nature. For we do not find that the devil created anything whatsoever, since indeed he is himself a creature of God, like the other angels. . . .
2. Since, therefore, all things were made by God, and since the devil has become the cause of apostasy to himself and others, justly does the Scripture always term those who remain in a state of apostasy "sons of the devil" and "angels of the wicked one." For [the word] "son," as one before me has observed, has a twofold meaning: one [is a son] in the order of nature, because he was born a son; the other, in that he was made so, is reputed a son, although there be a difference between being born so and being made so. For the first is indeed born from the person referred to; but the second is made so by him, whether as respects his creation or by the teaching of his doctrine.

{Isa 1:2; Ps 18:45; Mt 13:38; Jn 8:44}
For when any person has been taught from the mouth of another, he is termed the son of him who instructs him, and the latter [is called] his father. According to nature, then -that is, according to creation, so to speak--we are all sons of God, because we have all been created by God. But with respect to obedience and doctrine we are not all the sons of God: those only are so who believe in Him and do His will. And those who do not believe, and do not obey His will, are sons and angels of the devil, because they do the works of the devil. And that such is the case He has declared in Isaiah: "I have begotten and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me."(1) And again, where He says that these children are aliens: "Strange children have lied unto Me."(2) According to nature, then, they are [His] children, because they have been so created; but with regard to their works, they are not His children.
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk. 4, ch. 41, par 2

{Eternal Security; Ps 58:3-4}
3. For as, among men, those sons who disobey their fathers, being disinherited, are still their sons in the course of nature, but by law are disinherited, for they do not become the heirs of their natural parents; so in the same way is it with God,--those who do not obey Him being disinherited by Him, have ceased to be His sons. Wherefore they cannot receive His inheritance: as David says, "Sinners are alienated from the womb; their anger is after the likeness of a serpent."
Irenaeus, Against Heresies, bk. 4, ch. 41, par 3

{Free Will; Isa 1:16}
And inasmuch as they were not by nature so created by God, but had power also to act rightly, the same person said to them, giving them good counsel, "Wash you, make you clean; take away iniquity from your souls before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities." Thus, no doubt, since they had transgressed and sinned in the same manner, so did they receive the same reproof as did the Sodomites. But when they should be converted and come to repentance, and cease from evil, they should have power to become the sons of God, and to receive the inheritance of immortality which is given by Him.

Straightway, on our regeneration, we attained that perfection after which we aspired. For we were illuminated, which is to know God. He is not then imperfect who knows what is perfect. And do not reprehend me when I profess to know God; for so it was deemed right to speak to the Word, and He is free. For at the moment of the Lord's baptism there sounded a voice from heaven, as a testimony to the Beloved, "You art My beloved Son, to-day have I begotten You." Let us then ask the wise, Is Christ, begotten to-day, already perfect, or--what were most monstrous--imperfect? If the latter, there is some addition He requires yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His knowledge is absurd, since He is God. For none can be superior to the Word, or the teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant, that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in perfection, according to economic fore-ordination? And if He was perfect, why was He, the perfect one, baptized? It was necessary, they say, to fulfil the profession that pertained to humanity. Most excellent. Well, I assert, simultaneously with His baptism by John, He becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from him? Certainly not. But He is perfected by the washing--of baptism--alone, and is sanctified by the descent of the Spirit? Such is the case. The same also takes place in our case, whose exemplar Christ became. Being baptized, we are illuminated; illuminated, we become sons; being made sons, we are made perfect; being made perfect, we are made immortal. "I," says He, "have said that you are gods, and all sons of the Highest."    location 26965

{Titus 3:5; Acts 22:16; Heb 10:22; 1 Pet 3:21; Heb 10:32; Heb 9:9; Heb 6:4; Baptism; Grace}
This work [baptism] is variously called grace, and illumination, and perfection, and washing: washing, by which we cleanse away our sins; grace, by which the penalties accruing to transgressions are remitted; and illumination, by which that holy light of salvation is beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly. Now we call that perfect that lacks nothing. For what is yet wanting to him who knows God? For it were truly monstrous that that which is not complete should be called a gift (or act) of God's grace.    location 26977

Those bonds are with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being taken away by one Poeonian* medicine (* [Iliad, v. 401.]), the baptism of the Word. We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity,    location 27014

"Before faith came, we were kept under the Law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so that the Law became our pedagogue to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster." Do you not hear that we are no longer under that Law which was accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: "For you are all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus." There are not, then, in the same Word some "illuminated (gnostics); and some psychikos men;" [1 Cor. 2:14], but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: "For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup."    location 27020

Wherefore He Himself, declaring Himself very beautifully, likened Himself to a grain of mustard-seed; and pointed out the spirituality of the Word that is sown, and the productiveness of its nature, and the magnificence and conspicuousness of the power of the word; and besides, intimated that the pungency and the purifying virtue of punishment are profitable on account of its sharpness. By the little grain, as it is figuratively called, He bestows salvation on all humanity abundantly.    location 27634

For the life of Christians, in which we are now trained, is a system of reasonable actions--that is, of those things taught by the Word--an unfailing energy which we have called faith.

For neither is food our business, nor is pleasure our aim; . . . discrimination to be employed in reference to food. And it is to be simple, truly plain, suiting precisely simple and artless children--as ministering to life, not to luxury. . . .

"And if one of the unbelievers call us to a feast, and we determine to go" (for it is a good thing not to mix with the dissolute), the apostle bids us "eat what is set before us, asking no questions for conscience sake." Similarly he has enjoined to purchase "what is sold in the shambles," without curious questioning.  . . . We are not, then, to abstain wholly from various kinds of food, but only are not to be taken up about them. We are to partake of what is set before us, as becomes a Christian, out of respect to him who has invited us, by a harmless and moderate participation in the social meeting; regarding the sumptuousness of what is put on the table as a matter of indifference, despising the dainties, as after a little destined to perish. "Let him who eats not despise him who does not eat; and let him who eats not judge him who eats." And a little way on he explains the reason of the command, when he says, "He that eats, eats to the Lord, and gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and he gives God thanks." . . .And if we would persuade any of our fellow guests to virtue, we are all the more on this account to abstain from those dainty dishes; and so exhibit ourselves as a bright pattern of virtue, such as we ourselves have in Christ. "For if any of such foods make a brother stumble, I shall not eat it as long as the world lasts," he says, "that I may not make my brother stumble." I gain the man by a little self-restraint. "Have we not power to eat and to drink?" And "we know"--he speaks the truth--"that an idol is nothing in the world; but we have only one true God, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus." "But," he says, "through your knowledge the weak brother perishes, for whom Christ died; and they that would the conscience of the weak brethren sin against Christ."   location 27808, etc.

In what manner do you think the Lord drank when He became man for our sakes? As shamelessly as we? Was it not with decorum and propriety? Was it not deliberately? For rest assured, He Himself also partook of wine; for He, too, was man. And He blessed the wine, saying, "Take, drink: this is my blood"--the blood of the vine.    location 28034

{Mk 16:25; Mt 26:29; Mt 11:19; Jn 2:10-11}
And that he who drinks ought to observe moderation, He clearly showed by what He taught at feasts. For He did not teach affected by wine. And that it was wine which was the thing blessed, He showed again, when He said to His disciples, "I will not drink of the fruit of this vine, till I drink it with you in the kingdom of my Father." But that it was wine which was drunk by the Lord, He tells us again, when He spoke concerning Himself, reproaching the Jews for their hardness of heart: "For the Son of man," He says, "came, and they say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans." Let this be held fast by us against those that are called Encratites.    location 28037

{1 Cor 7:29-30; Gen 1:28; Mt 19:21}
And so the use of cups made of silver and gold, and of others inlaid with precious stones, is out of place, being only a deception of the vision. . . . The elaborate vanity, too, of vessels in glass chased, more apt to break on account of the art, teaching us to fear while we drink, is to be banished from our well-ordered constitution. And silver couches, and pans and vinegar-saucers, . . . and couches with silver feet and inlaid with ivory. . .. Explaining this more clearly, he adds, "It remains that they that have wives be as though they had none, and they that buy as though they possessed not." And if he speaks thus of marriage, in reference to which God says, "Multiply," how do you not think that senseless display is by the Lord's authority to be banished? Wherefore also the Lord says, "Sell what you hast, and give to the poor; and come, follow me."     location 28065, 28070, 28073, 28077

For my part, I approve of Plato, who plainly lays it down as a law that a man is not to labor for wealth of gold or silver, nor to possess a useless vessel which is not for some necessary purpose, and moderate; so that the same thing may serve for many purposes, and the possession of a variety of things may be done away with.    location 28082

{Luxury}
For though such of us as cultivate the soil need a mattock and plough, none of us will make a pickaxe of silver or a sickle of gold, but we employ the material which is serviceable for agriculture, not what is costly. What prevents those who are capable of considering what is similar from entertaining the same sentiments with respect to household utensils, of which let use, not expense, be the measure? For tell me, does the table-knife not cut unless it be studded with silver, and have its handle made of ivory? Or must we forge Indian steel in order to divide meat, as when we call for a weapon for the fight? What if the basin be of earthenware? will it not receive the dirt of the hands? or the footpan the dirt of the foot?    location 28088

{Banquets, Pagan}
A night spent over drink invites drunkenness, rouses lust, and is audacious in deeds of shame. For if people occupy their time with pipes, and psalteries, and choirs, and dances, and Egyptian clapping of hands, and such disorderly frivolities, they become quite immodest and intractable, beat on cymbals and drums, and make a noise on instruments of delusion; for plainly such a banquet, as seems to me, is a theatre of drunkenness.   location 28123
Clement of Alexandria, The Pedagogue, bk. 2, ch.4

{2 Pet 2:13; Jude 12; Musical Instruments}
not spending our time in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness." Let the pipe be resigned to the shepherds, and the flute to the superstitious who are engrossed in idolatry. For, in truth, such instruments are to be banished from the temperate banquet, being more suitable to beasts than men, and the more irrational portion of mankind.
and we must be on our guard against whatever pleasure titillates eYou and ear, and effeminates. . . .   location 28132
Clement of Alexandria, The Pedagogue, bk. 2, ch.4

{Ps 150:3-6; Musical Instruments}
[The] numbers of the Carian muse corrupt men's morals, drawing to perturbation of mind, by the licentious and mischievous art of music. . ...The Spirit, distinguishing from such revelry the divine service, sings, "Praise Him with the sound of trumpet;" for with sound of trumpet He shall raise the dead. "Praise Him on the psaltery;" for the tongue is the psaltery of the Lord. "And praise Him on the lyre." By the lyre is meant the mouth struck by the Spirit, as it were by a plectrum. "Praise with the timbrel and the dance," refers to the Church meditating on the resurrection of the dead in the resounding skin. "Praise Him on the chords and organ." Our body He calls an organ, and its nerves are the strings, by which it has received harmonious tension, and when struck by the Spirit, it gives forth human voices. "Praise Him on the clashing cymbals." He calls the tongue the cymbal of the mouth, which resounds with the pulsation of the lips. Therefore He cried to humanity, "Let every breath praise the Lord," because He cares forevery breathing thing which He has made. For man is truly a pacific instrument; while other instruments, if you investigate, you will find to be warlike, inflaming to lusts, or kindling up amours, or rousing wrath.  . . . In their wars, therefore, the Etruscans use the trumpet, the Arcadians the pipe, the Sicilians the pectides, the Cretans the lyre, the Lacedaemonians the flute, the Thracians the horn, the Egyptians the drum, and the Arabians the cymbal. The one instrument of peace, the Word alone by which we honor God, is what we employ. We no longer employ the ancient psaltery, and trumpet, and timbrel, and flute, which those expert in war and contemners of the fear of God were wont to make use of    location 28143

{Eph 5:20; Ps 33:1-3; 1 Tim 4:3-4}
"Whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and His Father." This is our thankful revelry. And even if you wish to sing and play to the harp or lyre, there is no blame. You shall imitate the righteous Hebrew king in his thanksgiving to God. "Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous; praise is comely to the upright," says the prophecy. "Confess to the Lord on the harp; play to Him on the psaltery of ten strings. Sing to Him a new song." And does not the ten-stringed psaltery indicate the Word Jesus, who is manifested by the element of the decad? And as it is befitting, before partaking of food, that we should bless the Creator of all; so also in drinking it is suitable to praise Him on partaking of His creatures.    location 28152

{Ps 149:3-4; Music}
But let amatory songs be banished far away, and let our songs be hymns to God. "Let them praise," it is said, "His name in the dance, and let them play to Him on the timbrel and psaltery." And what is the choir which plays? The Spirit will show you: "Let His praise be in the congregation (church) of the saints; let them be joyful in their King." And again he adds, "The Lord will take pleasure in His people." For temperate harmonies are to be admitted; but we are to banish as far as possible from our robust mind those liquid harmonies, which, through pernicious arts in the modulations of tones, train to effeminacy and scurrility. But grave and modest strains say farewell to the turbulence of drunkenness. Chromatic harmonies are therefore to be abandoned to immodest revels,    location 28163

For speech is the fruit of the mind. If, then, wags are to be ejected from our society, we ourselves must by no manner of means be allowed to stir up laughter. For it were absurd to be found imitators of things of which we are prohibited to be listeners; and still more absurd for a man to set about making himself a laughing-stock. . . . Pleasantry is allowable, not waggery. Besides, even laughter must be kept in check. . ...For, in a word, whatever things are natural to men we must not eradicate from them, but rather impose on them limits and suitable times. For man is not to laugh on all occasions because he is a laughing animal,    location 28180, 28182

And much more must we keep pure from shameful deeds: on the one hand, from exhibiting and exposing parts of the body which we ought not; and on the other, from beholding what is forbidden. For the modest son [Shem] could not bear to look on the shameful exposure of the righteous man [Noah]; and modesty covered what intoxication exposed--the spectacle of the transgression of ignorance.

The Lord Himself, therefore, dividing His precepts into what relates to the body, the soul, and thirdly, external things, counsels us to provide external things on account of the body; and manages the body by the soul (psyke), and disciplines the soul, saying, "Take no thought for your life (psyke) what you shall eat; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on; for the life is more than meat, and the body more than raiment."    location 28667

"There was a certain man," said the Lord, narrating, "very rich, who was clothed in purple and scarlet, enjoying himself splendidly every day." This was the hay. "And a certain poor man named Lazarus was laid at the rich man's gate, full of sores, desiring to be filled with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table." This is the grass.

I say, then, that man requires clothes for nothing else than the covering of the body, for defense against excess of cold and intensity of heat, lest the inclemency of the air injure us. And if this is the object of clothing, see that one kind be not assigned to men and another to women. For it is common to both to be covered, as it is to eat and drink. The necessity, then, being common, we judge that the provision ought to be similar. For as it is common to both to require things to cover them, so also their coverings ought to be similar; although such a covering ought to be assumed as is requisite for covering the eyes of women. For if the female sex, on account of their weakness, desire more [i.e., fancy clothing], we ought to blame the habit of that evil training, by which often men reared up in bad habits become more effeminate than women. . . . But this must not be yielded to. And if some accommodation is to be made [to sisters], they may be permitted to use softer clothes, provided they put out of the way fabrics foolishly thin, and of curious texture in weaving; bidding farewell to embroidery of gold and Indian silks    location 28710

For luxurious clothing, which cannot conceal the shape of the body, is no more a covering.

The Apocalypse says also that the Lord Himself appeared wearing such a robe. It says also, "I saw the souls of those that had witnessed, beneath the altar, and there was given to each a white robe."

Let not art contend against nature; that is, let not falsehood strive with truth.

Why so? Because the subsequent discourse of the prophet reproaches them, saying, "Sons have I begotten and upraised, but they have reprobated me;" and again, "And if you shall have outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you; and if you shall have multiplied prayers, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of blood;"

Whence we (Christians) understand that we still more ought to observe a sabbath from all "servile work" always, and not only every seventh day, but through all time.

the temporal sabbath is human, and the eternal sabbath is accounted divine; concerning which He predicts through Isaiah: "And there shall be," He says, "month after month, and day after day, and sabbath after sabbath; and all flesh shall come to adore in Jerusalem, says the Lord;" which we understand to have been fulfilled in the times of Christ, when "all flesh"-- that is, every nation--" came to adore in Jerusalem" God the Father, through Jesus Christ His Son, as was predicted through the prophet: "Behold, proselytes through me shall go unto You." Thus, therefore, before this temporal sabbath, there was therefore an eternal sabbath foreshown and foretold; just as before the carnal circumcision there was therefore a spiritual circumcision foreshown. In short, let them teach us, as we have already premised, that Adam observed the sabbath; or that Abel, when offering to God a holy victim, pleased Him by a religious reerence for the sabbath; or that Enoch, when translated, had been a keeper of the sabbath; or that Noah the ark-builder observed [the Sabbath].

But the Jews are sure to say, that ever since this precept was given through Moses, the ob-servance has been binding. Accordingly it is manifest that the precept was not eternal nor spiritual, but temporary, which would one day cease. In short, so true is it that it is not in the exemption from work of the sabbath--that is, of the seventh day--that the celebration of this solemnity is to consist, that Joshua the son of Nun, at the time that he was reducing the city Jericho by war, stated that he had received from God a precept to order the people that priests should carry the ark of the testament of God seven days, making the circuit of the city; and that thus, when the seventh day's circuit had been performed, the walls of the city would spontaneously fall.

From this proceeding we gather that the twofold sacrifices of "the peoples" were even from the very beginning foreshown. In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to "the people" Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel's introduction thither, there should there be celebrated sacrifices and holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in the holy land. Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the prophets, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of the twelve prophets: "I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my Name has been made famous among all the nations, says the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer clean sacrifices to my Name."

Thus, accordingly, the spiritual "sacrifices of praise" are pointed to, and "an heart contribulate" is demonstrated an acceptable sacrifice to God.

"Thine arrows," he says, "are sharp,"--God's everywhere-flying precepts (arrows) threatening the exposure1283 of every heart, and carrying compunction and transfixion to each conscience: "peoples shall fall beneath you,"--of course, in adoration. Thus mighty in war and weapon-bearing is Christ; thus will He "receive the spoils," not of "Samaria" alone, but of all nations as well.

The Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner of Christ, John, a fu-ture "angel," through the prophet: "Behold, I send my angel before Your"--that is, Christ's--"face, who shall prepare your way before you." Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those "angels" whom God has appointed as ministers of His power.
For the same John is called not merely an "angel" of Christ, but therefore a "lamp"
shining before Christ: for David predicts, "I have prepared the lamp for my Christ;" and him coming "to fulfil the prophets," called so to the Jews. "He was," He says, "the burning and shining lamp;" as being he who not merely "prepared His ways in the desert," but there-fore, by pointing out "the Lamb of God," illumined the minds of men by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb  whom Moses was wont to announce as des-tined to suffer. Thus, too, (was the son of Nun called) JOSHUA, on account of the future mystery of his name: for that name (He who spoke with Moses) confirmed as His own which Himself had conferred on him, because He had bidden him thenceforth be called, not "angel" nor "Oshea," but "Joshua." Thus, therefore, each name is appropriate to the Christ of God--that He should be called Jesus as well (as Christ). And that the virgin of whom it behoved Christ to be born (as we have above mentioned) must derive her lineage of the seed of David, the prophet in subsequent passages evidently asserts. "And there shall be born," he says, "a rod from the root of Jesse"--which rod is Mary--"and a flower shall as-cend from his root: and there shall rest upon him the Spirit of God, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of discernment and piety, the spirit of counsel and truth; the spirit of God's fear shall fill Him."

And He cried into mine ears with a loud voice, saying, The vengeance of this city is at hand; and each one had vessels of extermina-tion in his hand. And, behold, six men were coming toward the way of the high gate which was looking toward the north, and each one's double-axe of dispersion was in his hand: and one man in the midst of them, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and a girdle of sapphire about his loins: and they entered, and took their stand close to the brazen altar. And the glory of the God of Israel, which was over the house, in the open court of it, as-cended from the cherubim: and the Lord called the man who was clothed with the garment reaching to the feet, who had upon his loins the girdle; and said unto him, Pass through the midst of Jerusalem, and write the sign Tau on the foreheads of the men who groan and grieve over all the enormities which are done in their midst. And while these things were do-ing, He said unto an hearer, Go you after him into the city, and cut short; and spare not with your eyes, and pity not elder or youth or virgin; and little ones and women slay you all, that they may be thoroughly wiped away; but all upon whom is the sign Tau approach you not; and begin with my saints."

For when the sons of the prophets were cutting "wood" with axes on the bank of the river Jordan, the iron flew off and sank in the stream; and so, on Elisha the prophet's coming up, the sons of the prophets beg of him to extract from the stream the iron which had sunk. And accordingly Elisha, having taken "wood," and cast it into that place where the iron had been submerged, forthwith it rose and swam on the surface, and the "wood" sank, which the sons of the prophets recovered. Whence they understood that Elijah's spirit was presently conferred upon him. What is more manifest than the mystery of this "wood,"--that the obduracy of this world had been sunk in the profundity of error, and is freed in baptism by the "wood" of Christ, that is, of His passion; in order that what had formerly perished through the "tree" in Adam, should be restored through the "tree" in Christ?

in accordance with a prophecy of Hosea, uttered on this wise: "Before daybreak shall they arise unto Me, saying, Let us go and return unto the Lord our God, because Himself will draw us out and free us. After a space of two days, on the third day"-- which is His glori-ous resurrection-- He received back into the heavens (from where the Spirit Himself had come to the virgin) Him whose nativity and passion alike the Jews have failed to acknowledge. Therefore, since the Jews still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved to be come, let the Jews recognize their own fate,--a fate which they were constantly foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the Christ, on account of the impiety with which they despised and slew Him. For first, from the day when, according to the saying of Isaiah, "a man cast forth his abominations of gold and sil-ver, which they made to adore with vain and hurtful (rites),"--that is, ever since we Gen-tiles, with our breast doubly enlightened through Christ's truth, cast forth (let the Jews see it) our idols,--what follows has likewise been fulfilled. For "the Lord of Sabaoth has taken away among the Jews from Jerusalem," among the other things named, "the wise architect" too, who builds the church, God's temple, and the holy city, and the house of the Lord. For thenceforth God's grace desisted (from working) among them. And "the clouds were com-manded not to rain a shower upon the vineyard of Sorek,"--the clouds being celestial ben-efits, which were commanded not to be forthcoming to the house of Israel; for it "had borne thorns"--whereof that house of Israel had wrought a crown for Christ--and not "righteousness, but a clamor,"--the clamor whereby it had extorted His surrender to the cross. And thus, the former gifts of grace being withdrawn, "the law and the prophets were until John," and the fish pool of Bethsaida until the advent of Christ: thereafter it ceased curatively to remove from Israel infirmities of health; since, as the result of their persever-ance in their frenzy, the name of the Lord was through them blasphemed, as it is written: "On your account the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles:" for it is from them that the infamy (attached to that name) began, and (was propagated during) the interval from Tiberius to Vespasian. And because they had committed these crimes, and had failed to understand that Christ "was to be found" in "the time of their visitation," their land has been made "desert, and their cities utterly burnt with fire, while strangers devour their re-gion in their sight: the daughter of Sion is derelict, as a watch-tower in a vineyard, or as a shed in a cucumber garden,"--ever since the time, to wit, when "Israel knew not" the Lord, and "the People understood Him not;" but rather "quite forsook, and provoked unto in-dignation, the Holy One of Israel."

So, too, in Zechariah, in His own person, nay, in the very mystery of His name therefore, the most true Priest of the Father, His own Christ, is delineated in a twofold garb with ref-erence to the two advents. First, He was clad in "sordid attire," that is, in the indignity of passible and mortal flesh, when the devil, therefore, was opposing himself to Him-- the in-stigator, to wit, of Judas the traitor-- who even after His baptism had tempted Him. In the next place, He was stripped of His former sordid raiment, and adorned with a garment down to the foot, and with a turban and a clean mitre, that is, (with the garb) of the second advent; since He is demonstrated as having attained "glory and honor." Nor will you be able to say that the man (there depicted) is "the son of Jozadak," who was never at all clad in a sordid garment, but was always adorned with the sacerdotal garment, nor ever de-prived of the sacerdotal function. But the "Jesus" there alluded to is CHRIST, the Priest of God the most high Father; who at His FIRST ADVENT came in humility, in human form, and passible, even up to the period of His passion; being Himself likewise made, through all (stages of suffering) a victim for us all; who after His resurrection was "clad with a garment down to the foot," and named the Priest of God the Father unto eternity.

So, again, I will make an interpretation of the two goats which were habitually offered on the fast-day. Do not they, too, point to each successive stage in the character of the Christ who is already come? A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar (they were), because of the identity of the Lord's general appearance, inasmuch as He is not to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognized by those by whom He was once hurt. But the one of them, girded with scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and tearing, and piercing, was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked with manifest tokens of Christ's passion; who, after being girded with scarlet garment, and subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with all contumelies, was crucified outside the city. The other, howev-er, offered for sins, and given as food to the priests merely of the temple, gave signal evi-dences of the second appearance; in so far as, after the expiation of all sins, the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy a spiritual public distribution (as it were) of the Lord's grace, while all others are fasting from salvation.

The heretics against whom this work is directed, were the same who maintained that the demiurge, or the god who created this world and gave the Mosaic dispensation, was opposed to the supreme God.

Because there was present with Him no power, no material, no nature which belonged to any other than Himself. 55642

God had a far nobler and more suitable one in His own Wisdom-- one which was not to be gauged by the writings of philosophers, but to be learnt from the words or prophets. This alone, indeed, knew the mind of the Lord. For "who knows the things of God, and the things in God, but the Spirit, which is in Him?" Now His wisdom is that Spirit. This was His counsellor, the very way of His wisdom and knowledge. Of this He made all things, making them through It, and making them with It. "When He prepared the heavens," so says (the Scripture ), "I was present with Him; and when He strengthened above the winds the lofty clouds, and when He secured the fountains which are under the heaven, I was present, compacting these things along with Him. I was He in whom He took delight; moreover, I daily rejoiced in His presence: for He rejoiced when He had finished the world, and among the sons of men did He show forth His pleasure." Now, who would not rather approve of this as the Fountain and origin of all things-- of 55653

{Prov 8:22-25; Jn 1:1; Father and Son; Ps 45:1}
Indeed, as soon as He perceived It to be necessary for His creation of the world, He immediately creates It, and generates It in Himself. "The Lord," says the Scripture, "possessed me, the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works. Before the worlds He founded me; before He made the earth, before the mountains were settled in their places; moreover, before the hills He generated me, and prior to the depths was I begotten." Let Hermogenes then confess that the very Wisdom of God is declared to be born and created, for the especial reason that we should not suppose that there is any other being than God alone who is unbegotten and uncreated. For if that, which from its being inherent in the Lord was of Him and in Him, was yet not without a beginning,-- I mean His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God It began to assume motion for the arrangement of His creative works,-- how much more impossible is it that anything should have been without a beginning which was extrinsic to the Lord! But if this same Wisdom is the Word of God, in the capacity of Wisdom, and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also (nothing) was set in order without Wisdom, how can it be that anything, except the Father, should be older, and on this account indeed nobler, than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word? Not to say that what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful than that which is made. Because that which did not require a Maker to give it existence, will be much more elevated in rank than that which had an author to bring it into being. 55664

Therefore on this ground Hermogenes puts Matter even before God, by putting it before the Son. Because the Son is the Word, and "the Word is God," and "I and my Father are one." 55669
Tertullian, Against Hermogenes, ch.18

{Gen 1:1; Prov 8:22}
No doubt, a substantial thing may be the beginning of some other thing which may be formed out of it; thus the clay is the beginning of the vessel, and the seed is the beginning of the plant. But when we employ the word beginning in this sense of origin, and not in that of order, we do not omit to mention also the name of that particular thing which we regard as the origin of the other. 55687
The Greek term for beginning, which is arche, admits the sense not only of priority of order, but of power as well; whence princes and magistrates are called archontes. Therefore in this sense too, beginning may be taken for princely authority and power. It was, indeed, in His transcendent authority and power, that God made the heaven and the earth. 55690
Tertullian, Against Hermogenes, ch.19

{Prov 8:22}
But in proof that the Greek word means nothing else than beginning, and that beginning admits of no other sense than the initial one, we have that (Being) even acknowledging such a beginning, who says: "The Lord possessed me, the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works." For since all things were made by the Wisdom of God, it follows that, when God made both the heaven and the earth in principio-- that is to say, in the beginning-- He made them in His Wisdom. 55697
When Wisdom, however, was referred to, it was quite right to say, in the beginning. For it was in Wisdom that He made all things at first, because by meditating and arranging His plans therein, He had in fact already done (the work of creation); and if He had even intended to create out of matter, He would yet have effected His creation when He previously meditated on it and arranged it in His Wisdom, since It was in fact the beginning of His ways: 55707

I will apply the Gospel as a supplementary testimony to the Old Testament.

"In the beginning was the Word"-- that is, the same beginning, of course, in which God made the heaven and the earth--" and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made."

The Scripture, which at its very outset proposes to run through the order thereof tells us as its first information that it was created; it next proceeds to set forth what sort of earth it was. In like manner with respect to the heaven, it informs us first of its creation--" In the beginning God made the heaven:" it then goes on to introduce its arrangement; how that God both separated "the water which was below the firmament from that which was above the firmament," and called the firmament heaven,-- the very thing He had created in the beginning. Similarly it (afterwards) treats of man: "And God created man, in the image of God made He him." It next reveals how He made him: "And (the Lord) God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Now this is undoubtedly the correct and fitting mode for the narrative. First comes a prefatory statement, then follow the details in full; first the subject is named, then it is described. 55815

Besides, the belief that everything was made from nothing will be impressed upon us by that ultimate dispensation of God which will bring back all things to nothing. For "the very heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll;" nay, it shall come to nothing along with the earth itself, with which it was made in the beginning. "Heaven and earth shall pass away," says He. "The first heaven and the first earth passed away," "and there was found no place for them," because, of course, that which comes to an end loses locality. 55953
Tertullian, Against Hermogenes, ch.34
"And the stars too shall fall from heaven, even as a fig-tree casteth her green figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind." "The mountains shall melt like wax at the presence of the Lord;" that is, "when He riseth to shake terribly the earth." "But I will dry up the pools;" and "they shall seek water, and they shall find none." Even "the sea shall be no more." Now if any person should go so far as to suppose that all these passages ought to be spiritually interpreted, he will yet be unable to deprive them of the true accomplishment of those issues which must come to pass just as they have been written. 55965

He says that the Father Himself came down into the virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ.

Again: "If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down from hence; for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning you"— referring no doubt, to the Father—" and in their hands they shall bear you up, that you hurt not your foot against a stone." Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: "Away with Matthew; away with Luke! Why heed their words? In spite of them, I declare that it was God Himself that I approached; it was the Almighty Himself that I tempted face to face; and it was for no other purpose than to tempt Him that I approached Him. If, on the contrary, it had been only the Son of God, most likely I should never have condescended to deal with Him." However, he is himself a liar from the beginning, and whatever man he instigates in his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas. For he was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a prison; on which occasion, even "if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profited him nothing," not having the love of God, whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop of Rome* had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, he, by importunately urging false accusations against the prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop's predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the said gifts.

In the course of time, then, the Father indeed was born, and the Father suffered, God Himself, the Lord Almighty, whom in their preaching they declare to be Jesus Christ!! We, however, as we indeed always have done (and more especially since we have been better instructed by the Paraclete, who leads men indeed into all truth), believe that there is one only God, but under the following dispensation, or oikonomia , as it is called, that this one only God has also a Son, His Word, who proceeded from Himself, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made. Him we believe to have been sent by the Father into the virgin, and to have been born of her— being both Man and God, the Son of Man and the Son of God, and to have been called by the name of Jesus Christ; we believe Him to have suffered, died, and been buried, according to the Scriptures, and, after He had been raised again by the Father and taken back to heaven, to be sitting at the right hand of the Father, and that He will come to judge the quick and the dead; who sent also from heaven from the Father, according to His own promise, the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, the sanctifier of the faith of those who believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost.

before any of the older heretics, much more before Praxeas, a pretender of yesterday, will be apparent both from the lateness of date which marks all heresies, and also from the absolutely novel character of our new-fangled Praxeas. In this principle also we must henceforth find a presumption of equal force against all heresies whatsoever— that whatever is first is true, whereas that is spurious which is later in date. But keeping this prescriptive rule inviolate, still some opportunity must be given for reviewing (the statements of heretics), with a view to the instruction and protection of divers persons; were it only that it may not seem that each perversion of the truth is condemned without examination, and simply prejudged; especially in the case of this heresy, which supposes itself to possess the pure truth, in thinking that one cannot believe in One Only God in any other way than by saying that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are the very selfsame Person. As if in this way also one were not All, in that All are of One, by unity (that is) of substance; while the mystery of the dispensation is still guarded, which distributes the Unity into a Trinity, placing in their order the three Persons— the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: three, however, not in condition, but in degree; not in substance, but in form; not in power, but in aspect; yet of one substance, and of one condition, and of one power, inasmuch as He is one God, from whom these degrees and forms and aspects are reckoned, under the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. How they are susceptible of number without division, will be shown as our treatise proceeds.

There are some who allege that even Genesis opens thus in Hebrew: "In the beginning God made for Himself a Son.*1" As there is no ground for this, I am led to other arguments derived from God's own dispensation, in which He existed before the creation of the world, up to the generation of the Son. For before all things God was alone— being in Himself and for Himself universe, and space, and all things. Moreover, He was alone, because there was nothing external to Him but Himself. Yet even not then was He alone; for He had with Him that which He possessed in Himself, that is to say, His own Reason. For God is rational, and Reason was first in Him; and so all things were from Himself. This Reason is His own Thought (or Consciousness= Sensus ipsius.(source)) which the Greeks call logos, by which term we also designate Word or Discourse*2 and therefore it is now usual with our people, owing to the mere simple interpretation of the term, to say that the Word (=Sermonen) was in the beginning with God; although it would be more suitable to regard Reason as the more ancient; because God had not Word (=Sermonalis) from the beginning, but He had Reason (=Rationalis) even before the beginning;

Observe, then, that when you are silently conversing with yourself, this very process is carried on within you by your reason, which meets you with a word at every movement of your thought, at every impulse of your conception. Whatever you think, there is a word; whatever you conceive, there is reason. . . . Thus, in a certain sense, the word is a second person within you, through which in thinking you utter speech, and through which also, (by reciprocity of process,) in uttering speech you generate thought. The word is itself a different thing from yourself. . . .

Then, therefore, does the Word also Himself assume His own form and glorious garb, His own sound and vocal utterance, when God says, "Let there be light." This is the perfect nativity of the Word, when He proceeds forth from God— formed*1 by Him first to devise and think out all things under the name of Wisdom—" The Lord created or formed me as the beginning of His ways;" then afterward begotten, to carry all into effect—" When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him." Thus does He make Him equal to Him: for by proceeding from Himself He became His first-begotten Son, because begotten before all things; and His only-begotten also, because alone begotten of God, in a way peculiar to Himself, from the womb of His own heart— even as the Father Himself testifies: "My heart," says He, "has emitted my most excellent Word.*2"

*1 See Adv. Valentin. cc. xiv. xv.
Valentinus divides and separates his prolations from their Author, and places them at so great a distance from Him, that the Aeon (*It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word  (ho aion), from the archaic  (aiwon).source / Strong's Greek 165. aión ) does not know the Father: he longs, indeed, to know Him, but cannot; nay, he is almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter.*1 With us, however, the Son alone knows the Father, and has Himself unfolded "the Father's bosom." He has also heard and seen all things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by the Father, that also does He speak. And it is not His own will, but the Father's, which He has accomplished, which He had known most intimately, even from the beginning. "For what man knows the things which be in God, but the Spirit which is in Him?" But the Word was formed by the Spirit, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the body of the Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the Father, as He says, "I am in the Father;" and is always with God, according to what is written, "And the Word was with God;" and never separate from the Father, or other than the Father, since "I and the Father are one." This will be the prolation, taught by the truth (Literally, the , "of the truth."), the guardian of the Unity, wherein we declare that the Son is a prolation from the Father, without being separated from Him. For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also declares, just as the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the river, and the sun the ray. For these are probolai ( ), or emanations, of the substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate, indeed, to call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the fountain, and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a parent, and everything which issues from the origin is an offspring. Much more is (this true of) the Word of God, who has actually received as His own peculiar designation the name of Son. But still the tree is not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from God. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and His Word— the Father and His Son— two. For the root and the tree are distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds, without being on that account separated. Where, however, there is a second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps, does not at all disturb the Monarchy, whilst it at the same time guards the state of the Economy.

I testify that the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit are inseparable from each other, and so will you know in what sense this is said. Now, observe, my assertion is that the Father is one, and the Son one, and the Spirit one, and that They are distinct from Each Other. This statement is taken in a wrong sense by every uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it predicated a diversity, in such a sense as to imply a separation among the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit. I am, moreover, obliged to say this, when (extolling the Monarchy at the expense of the Economy) they contend for the identity of the Father and Son and Spirit, that it is not by way of diversity that the Son differs from the Father, but by distribution: it is not by division that He is different, but by distinction; because the Father is not the same as the Son, since they differ one from the other in the mode of their being. For the Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole, as He Himself acknowledges: "My Father is greater than I." In the Psalm His inferiority is described as being "a little lower than the angels." Thus the Father is distinct from the Son, being greater than the Son, inasmuch as He who begets is one, and He who is begotten is another; He, too, who sends is one, and He who is sent is another; and He, again, who makes is one, and He through whom the thing is made is another.

I have given You for a light to the Gentiles, that You mayest be their salvation to the end of the earth." Hear now also the Son's utterances respecting the Father: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach the gospel unto men." He speaks of Himself likewise to the Father in the Psalm: "Forsake me not until I have declared the might of your arm to all the generation that is to come." Also to the same purport in another Psalm: "O Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!" But almost all the Psalms which prophesy of the person of Christ, represent the Son as conversing with the Father—that is, represent Christ (as speaking) to God. Observe also the Spirit speaking of the Father and the Son, in the character of a third Person: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit You on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." Likewise in the words of Isaiah: "Thus says the Lord to the Lord (*Tertullian reads Kurio instead of, "Cyrus." source) mine Anointed." Likewise, in the same prophet, He says to the Father respecting the Son: "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We brought a report concerning Him, as if He were a little child, as if He were a root in a dry ground, who had no form nor comeliness."

If the number of the Trinity also offends you, as if it were not connected in the simple Unity, I ask you how it is possible for a Being who is merely and absolutely One and Singular, to speak in plural phrase, saying, "Let us make man in our own image, and after our own likeness;" whereas He ought to have said, "Let me make man in my own image, and after my own likeness," as being a unique and singular Being? In the following passage, however, "Behold the man is become as one of us," He is either deceiving or amusing us in speaking plurally, if He is One only and singular. Or was it to the angels that He spoke, as the Jews interpret the passage, because these also acknowledge not the Son? Or was it because He was at once the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that He spoke to Himself in plural terms, making Himself plural on that very account? Nay, it was because He had already His Son close at His side, as a second Person, His own Word, and a third Person also, the Spirit in the Word, that He purposely adopted the plural phrase, "Let us make;" and, "in our image;" and, "become as one of us." . . .

But in respect of the previous works of the world what says the Scripture? Its first statement indeed is made, when the Son has not yet appeared: "And God said, Let there be light, and there was light."

Now if He too is God, according to John, (who says,) "The Word was God," then you have two Beings— One that commands that the thing be made, and the Other that executes the order and creates. In what sense, however, you ought to understand Him to be another, I have already explained, on the ground of Personality, not of Substance— in the way of distinction, not of division. But although I must everywhere hold one only substance in three coherent and inseparable (Persons), yet I am bound to acknowledge, from the necessity of the case, that He who issues a command is different from Him who executes it.

{Ps 45:6-7; Father and Son}
Well then, you reply, if He was God who spoke, and He was also God who created, at this rate, one God spoke and another created; (and thus) two Gods are declared. If you are so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of righteousness. You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even your God, has anointed You or made You His Christ." Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the scepter's royal power.

Gospel: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." There was One "who was," and there was another "with whom" He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit You on my right hand." And Isaiah says this: "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" Now he would most certainly have said your Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: "Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven."

Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord.

For it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as "children of light," adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as "the light of the world."

I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father "God," and invoke Jesus Christ as "Lord." But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him "God," as the same apostle says: "Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever." For I should give the name of "sun" even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms of one undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the Son.

[Otherwise,] the Scripture is false in stating that God said, "If a man see my face, he shall not live." Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fullness of His majesty, while we recognize the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His derived existence; even as it is not permitted us to contemplate the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray,

the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that He was visible before the days of His flesh, in the way that He says to Aaron and Miriam, "And if there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream; not as with Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, that is to say, in truth, and not enigmatically," that is to say, in image; as the apostle also expresses it, "Now we see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face." Since, therefore, He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses— a promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration), when as we read in the Gospel, "Moses appeared talking with Jesus"— it is evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were,) and an enigma, in vision and dream, that God, I mean the Son of God, appeared— to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly speak with him face to face, yet it was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were,) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spoke with Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face, eye to eye, how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His face, which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also say that His face cannot be seen, because He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose). Or what is that face of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? "I have seen God," says Jacob, "face to face, and my life is preserved." There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not, ) although He was the face of God, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form.

* Lam. iv. 20. Tertullian reads, "Spiritus personae ejus Christus Dominus." This varies only in the pronoun from the Septuagint, which runs, . According to our A.V., "the breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord" (or, "our anointed Lord"), allusion is made, in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, to the capture of the king—the last of David's line, "as an anointed prince." Comp.Jer. lii. 9.(source)
"My Father," says Christ, "is greater than I." Therefore the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? "The Spirit of His person is Christ the Lord.*" As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father's person, there is good reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged— that is to say, the Father— pronounced Him to be His "face." Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is His head; for "the head of Christ is God."

I will take out of the New Testament a confirmation of our view, that you may not straightway attribute to the Father every possible (relation and condition) which I ascribe to the Son. Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: "No man has seen God at any time;" meaning, of course, at any previous time. But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, "Whom no man has seen, nor can see;" because the man indeed would die who should see Him. But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and "handled" Christ. … How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; while He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs?

He came in the flesh, was the "Word in the beginning with God" the Father, and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father. "And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;" that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: "No man has seen God at any time." What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: "Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life." Well, (I must again ask,) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.

Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: "Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever." He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: "Whom none among men has seen, nor indeed can see;" and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: "Who only has immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto." It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God;" so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself— mortality, accessibility— of whom the apostle testifies that "He died according to the Scriptures," and that "He was seen by himself last of all,"— by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperiling his sight that he experienced that light. A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son, had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: "For no man shall see God, and live." This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary,) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two— the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because "the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do"—" do" that is, in His mind and thought. For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought, gives effect and form to what He sees.

It is the Son, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord.

For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done—( even ours, I say), "upon whom the ends of the world are come."

As to the point maintained by them, that the name of Christ belongs also to the Father, they shall hear (what I have to say) in the proper place.

For, without any detriment to the Son, it is quite possible for it to have rightly determined that God is only One, to whom the Son belongs; since He who has a Son ceases not on that account to exist,— Himself being One only, that is, on His own account, whenever He is named without the Son. And He is named without the Son whenever He is defined as the principle (of Deity) in the character of "its first Person," which had to be mentioned before the name of the Son; because it is the Father who is acknowledged in the first place, and after the Father the Son is named. Therefore "there is one God," the Father, "and without Him there is none else." And when He Himself makes this declaration, He denies not the Son, but says that there is no other God; and the Son is not different from the Father. Indeed, if you only look carefully at the contexts which follow such statements as this, you will find that they nearly always have distinct reference to the makers of idols and the worshippers thereof, with a view to the multitude of false gods being expelled by the unity of the Godhead, which nevertheless has a Son; and inasmuch as this Son is undivided and inseparable from the Father, so is He to be reckoned as being in the Father, even when He is not named. The fact is, if He had named Him expressly, He would have separated Him, saying in so many words: "Beside me there is none else, except my Son." In short He would have made His Son actually another, after excepting Him from others. Suppose the sun to say, "I am the Sun, and there is none other besides me, except my ray," would you not have remarked how useless was such a statement, as if the ray were not itself reckoned in the sun? He says, then, that there is no God besides Himself in respect of the idolatry both of the Gentiles as well as of Israel; nay, even on account of our heretics also, who fabricate idols with their words, just as the heathen do with their hands; that is to say, they make another God and another Christ. When, therefore, He attested His own unity, the Father took care of the Son's interests, that Christ should not be supposed to have come from another God, but from Him who had already said, "I am God and there is none other beside me," who shows us that He is the only God, but in company with His Son, with whom "He stretches out the heavens alone."

meaning alone with His Son, even as He is one with His Son. The utterance, therefore, will be in like manner the Son's, "I have stretched out the heavens alone," because by the Word were the heavens established. Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered to the Father's work. It must also be He who says, "I am the First, and to all futurity I AM." The Word, no doubt, was before all things. "In the beginning was the Word;" and in that beginning He was sent forth by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning, as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined that the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures.

They would have the entire revelation of both Testaments yield to these three passages, whereas the only proper course is to understand the few statements in the light of the many. But in their contention they only act on the principle of all heretics. For, inasmuch as only a few testimonies are to be found (making for them) in the general mass, they pertinaciously set off the few against the many, and assume the later against the earlier. The rule, however, which has been from the beginning established for every case, gives its prescription against the later assumptions, as indeed it also does against the fewer.

{Jn 10:24-30,32; Jn 10:34-38; Sabellianism}
When He was asked by the Jews if He were the very Christ (meaning, of course, the Christ of God; for to this day the Jews expect not the Father Himself, but the Christ of God, it being nowhere said that the Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, "I am telling you, and yet you do not believe: the works which I am doing, in my Father's name, they actually bear witness of me." Witness of what? Of that very thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry— whether He were the Christ of God. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance) that no man should pluck them out of His hand, He says, "My Father, which gave them to me, is greater than all;" adding immediately, "I am and my Father are one." Here, then, they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the first place that there is in this passage an intimation of Two Beings—" I and my Father;" then that there is a plural predicate, "are," inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the predicate terminates in an abstract, not a personal noun)—" we are one thing" Unum, not "one person" Unus. For if He had said "one Person," He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. Unus, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a case where) "Two" are still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says Unum, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity of number, but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection on the Father's part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son's, who obeys the Father's will. When He says, "I and my Father are one" in essence— Unum— He shows that there are Two, whom He puts on an equality and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement, that He "had showed them many works from the Father," for none of which did He deserve to be stoned. And to prevent their thinking Him deserving of this fate, as if He had claimed to be considered as God Himself, that is, the Father, by having said, "I and my Father are one," representing Himself as the Father's divine Son, and not as God Himself, He says, "If it is written in your law, I said, You are gods; and if the Scripture cannot be broken, say you of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemes, because He said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, even if you will not believe me, still believe the works; and know that I am in the Father, and the Father in me." It must therefore be by the works that the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; and so it is by the works that we understand that the Father is one with the Son.

And now it may be seen in what sense it was said, "He that has seen me has seen the Father,"— even in the same in which it was said in a previous passage, "I and my Father are one." Wherefore? Because "I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world" and, "I am the way: no man comes unto the Father, but by me;" and, "No man can come to me, except the Father draw him;" and, "All things are delivered unto me by the Father;" and, "As the Father quickeneth (the dead), so also doth the Son;" and again, "If you had known me, you would have known the Father also." For in all these passages He had shown Himself to be the Father's Commissioner, through whose agency even the Father could be seen in His works, and heard in His words, and recognized in the Son's administration of the Father's words and deeds. The Father indeed was invisible, as Philip had learnt in the law, and ought at the moment to have remembered: "No man shall see God, and live." So he is reproved for desiring to see the Father, as if He were a visible Being, and is taught that He only becomes visible in the Son from His mighty works, and not in the manifestation of His person.

In one Person they no doubt are well able to be co-existent. Of them Jesus consists— Man, of the flesh; of the spirit, God— and the angel designated Him as "the Son of God," in respect of that nature, in which He was spirit, reserving for the flesh the appellation "Son of Man." In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him "the Mediator between God and Men," and so affirmed His participation of both substances.

Well, but how could the Son suffer, if the Father did not suffer with Him? My answer is, The Father is separate from the Son, though not from Him as God. For even if a river be soiled with mire and mud, although it flows from the fountain identical in nature with it, and is not separated from the fountain, yet the injury which affects the stream reaches not to the fountain; and although it is the water of the fountain which suffers down the stream, still, since it is not affected at the fountain, but only in the river, the fountain suffers nothing, but only the river which issues from the fountain. So likewise the Spirit of God, whatever suffering it might be capable of in the Son, yet, inasmuch as it could not suffer in the Father, the fountain of the Godhead, but only in the Son, it evidently could not have suffered, as the Father. But it is enough for me that the Spirit of God suffered nothing as the Spirit of God, since all that It suffered It suffered in the Son.

This verity the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: "If the Father spared not His own Son." This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: "And the Lord has delivered Him up for our offences."

He orders everything, whatever it is, by a Word; arranges it by His Wisdom; perfects it by His Power. He can neither be seen—He is brighter than light; nor can be grasped—He is purer than touch; nor estimated; He is greater than all perceptions; infinite, immense, and how great is known to Himself alone.

{Jer 23:24; Isa 66:1; Acts 17:27-28; Heb 4:13}
Do you wish to see God with your fleshly eyes, when you are neither able to behold nor to grasp your own soul itself, by which you are enlivened and speak? But, moreover, it is said that God is ignorant of man's doings; and being established in heaven, He can neither survey all nor know individuals. You err, O man, and are deceived; for from where is God afar off, when all things heavenly and earthly, and which are beyond this province of the universe, are known to God, are full of God? Everywhere He is not only very near to us, but He is infused into us. Therefore once more look upon the sun: it is fixed fast in the heaven, yet it is diffused over all lands equally; present everywhere, it is associated and mingled with all things; its brightness is never violated. How much more God, who has made all things, and looks upon all things, from whom there can be nothing secret, is present in the darkness, is present in our thoughts, as if in the deep darkness. Not only do we act in Him, but also, I had almost said, we live with Him.
Mark Minucius Felix, Octavius, ch. 32.

{Mt 21:43; Jer 15:6; Jer 2:5-12; Ezra 8:22; Jews, Unbelieving; Mt 21:39-41; Josephus}
But it is objected [by the Romans] that it availed the Jews nothing that they themselves worshipped the one God with altars and temples, with the greatest superstition. You are guilty of ignorance if you are recalling later events while you are forgetful or unconscious of former ones. For they themselves also, as long as they worshipped our God—and He is the same God of all—with chastity, innocence, and religion, as long as they obeyed His wholesome precepts, from a few became innumerable, from poor became rich, from being servants became kings; a few overwhelmed many; unarmed men overwhelmed armed ones as they fled from them, following them up by God's command, and with the elements 194 striving on their behalf. Carefully read over their Scriptures, or if you are better pleased with the Roman writings, inquire concerning the Jews in the books (to say nothing of ancient documents) of Flavius Josephus or Antoninus Julianus, and you shall know that by their wickedness they deserved this fortune, and that nothing happened which had not before been predicted to them, if they should persevere in their obstinacy. Therefore you will understand that they forsook before they were forsaken, and that they were not, as you impiously say, "taken captive with their God," but they were given up by God as deserters from His discipline.
Mark Minucius Felix, Octavius, ch. 33.

{1 Cor 15:52-55; Jn 11:25-26; Cremation}
But who is so foolish or so brutish as to dare to deny that man, as he could first of all be formed by God, so can again be re-formed; that he is nothing after death, and that he was nothing before he began to exist; and as from nothing it was possible for him to be born, so from nothing it may be possible for him to be restored? Moreover, it is more difficult to begin that which is not, than to repeat that which has been. Do you think that, if anything is withdrawn from our feeble eyes, it perishes to God? Every single body, whether it is dried up into dust, or is dissolved into moisture, or is compressed into ashes, or is attenuated into smoke, is withdrawn from us, but it is reserved for God in the custody of the elements. Nor, as you believe, do we fear any loss from cremation, but we adopt the ancient and better custom of burying in the earth. See, therefore, how for our consolation all nature suggests a future resurrection. The sun sinks down and arises, the stars pass away and return, the flowers die and revive again, after their wintry decay the shrubs resume their leaves, seeds do not flourish again. unless they are rotted: thus the body in the tomb is like the trees which in winter hide their verdure with a deceptive dryness.
Mark Minucius Felix, Octavius, ch. 34.

{1 Pet 2:12; Phil 2:15-16}
from your numbers the prison boils over; but there is no Christian there, unless he is accused on account of his religion, or a deserter.

{Foreknowledge of God; Free will; Astrology}
Neither let anyone either take comfort from, or apologize for what happens from fate. Let what happens be of the disposition of fortune, yet the mind is free; and therefore man's doing, not his dignity, is judged. For what else is fate than what God has spoken of each one of us? since He can foresee our constitution, He determines also the fates for us, according to the deserts and the qualities of individuals. Thus in our case it is not the star under which we are born that is punished, but the particular nature of our disposition is blamed.
Mark Minucius Felix, Octavius, ch. 36.

{2 Cor 1:8-10; Mt 10:21-23}
God is neither unable to aid us, nor does He despise us, since He is both the ruler of all men and the lover of His own people. But in adversity He looks into and searches out each one; He weighs the disposition of every individual in dangers, even to death at last; He investigates the will of man, certain that to Him nothing can perish. Therefore, as gold by the fires, so are we declared by critical moments.
Mark Minucius Felix, Octavius, ch. 36.

{Modesty; Entertainment; Rom 13:13; Eph 4:17-19}
We therefore, who are measured by our character and our modesty, reasonably abstain from evil pleasures, and from your pomps and exhibitions, the origin of which in connection with sacred things we know, and condemn their mischievous enticements. For in the chariot games, who does not shudder at the madness of the people brawling among themselves? Or at the teaching of murder in the gladiatorial games? In the theatrical games also the madness is not less, but the debauchery is more prolonged: for now a mimic either expounds or shows forth adulteries; now nerveless player, while he feigns lust, suggests it; the same actor disgraces your gods by attributing to them adulteries, sighs, hatreds; the same provokes your tears with pretended sufferings, with vain gestures and expressions. Thus you demand murder in actuality [i.e., gladiators], while you weep at it in fiction.

COMMODIANUS****
{Gen 6:1-4}
When Almighty God, to beautify the nature of the world, willed that that earth should be visited by angels, when they were sent down they despised His laws. Such was the beauty of women, that it turned them aside; so that, being contaminated, they could not return to heaven. Rebels from God, they uttered words against Him. Then the Highest uttered His judgment against them; and from their seed giants are said to have been born. By them arts were made known in the earth, and they taught the dyeing of wool, and everything which is done; and to them, when they died, men erected images. But the Almighty, because they were of an evil seed, did not approve that, when dead, they should be brought back from death. Whence wandering they now subvert many bodies, and it is such as these especially that you this day worship and pray to as gods.

[Hippolytus****]
{Dan 1:1; Jer 25:11}
Daniel was born in the time of the prophetic ministry of the blessed Jeremiah, and in the reign of Jehoiakim. . . . When the whole people, then, were transported, and the city made desolate, and the sanctuary destroyed, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled that he spoke by the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "The sanctuary shall be desolate seventy year." Then we find that the blessed Daniel prophesied in Babylon, and appeared as the vindicator of Susanna.
 Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. I.  

{Dan 7:3-7; Dan 7:17-19; Dan 2:32; Dan 4:31-35}
1. In speaking of a "lioness from the sea," he meant the rising of the kingdom of Babylon, and that this was the "golden head of the image." And in speaking of its "eagle wings," he meant that king Nebuchadnezzar was exalted and that his glory was lifted up against God. Then he says "its wings were plucked off," i.e., that his glory was destroyed; for he was driven out of his kingdom. And the words, "A man's heart was given it, and it was made stand upon the feet of a man," mean that he came to himself again, and recognized that he was but a man, and gave the glory to God. Then after the lioness he sees a second beast, "like a bear," which signified the Persians. For after the Babylonians the Persians obtained the power. And in saying that "it had three ribs in its mouth," he pointed to the three nations, Persians, Medes, and Babylonians, which were expressed in the image by the silver after the gold. Then comes the third beast, "a leopard," which means the Greeks; for after the Persians, Alexander of Macedon had the power, when Darius was overthrown, which was also indicated by the brass in the image. And in saying that the beast "had four wings of a fowl, and four heads," he showed most clearly how the kingdom of Alexander was parted into four divisions. For in speaking of four heads, he meant the four kings that arose out of it. For Alexander, when dying, divided his kingdom into four parts. Then he says, "The fourth beast (was) dreadful and terrible: it had iron teeth, and claws of brass." Who, then, are meant by this but the Romans, whose kingdom, the kingdom that still stands, is expressed by the iron? "For," he says, "its legs are of iron."
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 1.

{Dan 2:33-35; Dan 2:41-43; Dan 7:8-27}
2. After this, then, what remains, beloved, but the toes of the feet of the image, in which "part shall be of iron and part of clay mixed together?" By the toes of the feet he meant, mystically, the ten kings that rise out of that kingdom. As Daniel says, "I considered the beast; and, lo, (there were) ten horns behind, among which shall come up another little horn springing from them;" by which none other is meant than the antichrist that is to rise; and he shall set up the kingdom of Judah. And in saying that "three horns" were "plucked up by the roots" by this one, he indicates the three kings of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, whom this one will slay in the array of war. And when he has conquered all, he will prove himself a terrible and savage tyrant, and will cause tribulation and persecution to the saints, exalting himself against them. And after him, it remains that "the stone" shall come from heaven which "smote the image" and shivered it, and subverted all the kingdoms, and gave the kingdom to the saints of the Most High. This "became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." Locations 92590-92594 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 2.
 

{Dan 7:24; Dan 2:32-33; Dan 7:4-8}
3. As these things, then, are destined to come to pass, and as the toes of the image turn out to be democracies,1296 and the ten horns of the beast are distributed among ten kings, let us look at what is before us more carefully, and scan it, as it were, with open eye. The "golden head of the image" is identical with the "lioness," by which the Babylonians were represented. "The golden shoulders and the arms of silver" are the same with the "bear," by which the Persians and Medes are meant. "The belly and thighs of brass" are the "leopard," by which the Greeks who ruled from Alexander onwards are intended. The "legs of iron" are the "dreadful and terrible beast," by which the Romans who hold the empire now are meant. The "toes of clay and iron" are the "ten horns" which are to be. The "one other little horn springing up in their midst" is the "antichrist." The stone that "smites the image and breaks it in pieces," and that filled the whole earth, is Christ, who comes from heaven and brings judgment on the world.  
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 3.


{Sabbath; Gen 2:3; 2 Tim 2:12; 2 Pet 3:8; Rev 17:10; Chronology; Millennium}
4. But that we may not leave our subject at this point undemonstrated, we are obliged to discuss the matter of the times, of which a man should not speak hastily, because they are a light to him. For as the times are noted from the foundation of the world, and reckoned from Adam, they set clearly before us the matter with which our inquiry deals. For the first appearance of our Lord in the flesh took place in Bethlehem, under Augustus, in the year 5500; and He suffered in the thirty-third year. And 6,000 years must needs be accomplished, in order that the Sabbath may come, the rest, the holy day "on which God rested from all His works." For the Sabbath is the type and emblem of the future kingdom of the saints, when they "shall reign with Christ," when He comes from heaven, as John says in his Apocalypse: for "a day with the Lord is as a thousand years." Since, then, in six days God made all things, it follows that 6,000 years must be fulfilled. And they are not yet fulfilled, as John says: "five are fallen; one is," that is, the sixth; "the other is not yet come."  
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 4.

{Rev 17:10; Ex 25:17-20; Chronology}
5. In mentioning the "other," moreover, he specifies the seventh, in which there is rest. But someone may be ready to say, "How will you prove to me that the Savior was born in the year 5500?" Learn that easily, O man; for the things that took place of old in the wilderness, under Moses, in the case of the tabernacle, were constituted types and emblems of spiritual mysteries, in order that, when the truth came in Christ in these last days, you might be able to perceive that these things were fulfilled. For He says to him, "And you shall make the ark of imperishable wood, and shall overlay it with pure gold within and without; and you shall make the length of it two cubits and a half, and the breadth thereof one cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half the height;" which measures, when summed up together, make five cubits and a half, so that the 5500 years might be signified thereby. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 5.

{Ex 25:11; Jn 19:14; Chronology}
6. At that time, then, the Savior appeared and showed His own body to the world, (born) of the virgin, who was the "ark overlaid with pure gold," with the Word within and the Holy Spirit without; so that the truth is demonstrated, and the "ark" made manifest. From the birth of Christ, then, we must reckon the 500 years that remain to make up the 6000, and thus the end shall be. And that the Savior appeared in the world, bearing the imperishable ark, His own body, at a time which was the fifth and half, John declares: "Now it was the sixth hour," he says, intimating by that, one-half of the day. But a day with the Lord is 1000 years; and the half of that, therefore, is 500 years. For it was not fitting that He should appear earlier, for the burden of the Law still endured, nor yet when the sixth day was fulfilled (for the baptism is changed), but on the fifth and half, in order that in the remaining half time the gospel might be preached to the whole world, and that when the sixth day was completed He might end the present life. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 6.
  
{Dan 7:2-3; Antichrist; Chronology}
7. Since, then, the Persians held the mastery for 330 years, and after them the Greeks, who were yet more glorious, held it for 300 years, of necessity the fourth beast, as being strong and mightier than all that were before it, will reign 500 years. When the times are fulfilled, and the ten horns spring from the beast in the last (times), then Antichrist will appear among them. When he makes war against the saints, and persecutes them, then may we expect the manifestation of the Lord from heaven.  
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 7.

{Dan 8:6-7}
8. The prophet having thus instructed us with all exactness as to the certainty of the things that are to be, broke off from his present subject, and passed again to the kingdom of the Persians and Greeks, recounting to us another vision which took place, and was fulfilled in its proper time; in order that, by establishing our belief in this, he might be able to present us to God as readier believers in the things that are to be. Accordingly, what he had narrated in the first vision, he again recounts in detail for the edification of the faithful. For by the "ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward," he means Darius, the king of the Persians, who overcame all the nations; "for," says he, "these beasts shall not stand before him." And by the "he-goat that came from the west," he means Alexander the Macedonian, the king of the Greeks; and in that he "came against that very ram, and was moved with anger, and smote him upon the face, and shivered him, and cast him upon the ground, and stamped upon him," this expresses just what has happened.  
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 8.

{Dan 8:7-8}
9. For Alexander waged war against Darius, and overcame him, and made himself master of the whole sovereignty, after routing and destroying his camp. Then, after the exaltation of the he-goat, his horn--the great one, namely--was broken; and there arose four horns under it, toward the four winds of heaven. For, when Alexander had made himself master of all the land of Persia, and had reduced its people into subjection, he thereupon died, after dividing his kingdom into four principalities, as has been shown above. And from that time "one horn was exalted, and waxed great, even to the power of heaven; and by him the sacrifice," he says, "was disturbed, and righteousness cast down to the ground." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 9.


{Dan 8:13-14}
10. For Antiochus arose, surnamed Epiphanes, who was of the line of Alexander. And after he had reigned in Syria, and brought under him all Egypt, he went up to Jerusalem, and entered the sanctuary, and seized all the treasures in the house of the Lord, and the golden candlestick, and the table, and the altar, and made a great slaughter in the land; even as it is written: "And the sanctuary shall be trodden under foot, unto evening and unto morning, a thousand and three hundred days." For it happened that the sanctuary remained desolate during that period, three years and a half, that the thousand and three hundred days might be fulfilled; until Judas Maccabaeus arose after the death of his father Matthias, and withstood him, and destroyed the encampment of Antiochus, and delivered the city, and recovered the sanctuary, and restored it in strict accordance with the law. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 10.

{Dan 9:1-2}
11. Since, then, the angel Gabriel also recounted these things to the prophet, as they have been understood by us, as they have also taken place, and as they have been all clearly described in the books of the Maccabees, let us see further what he says on the other weeks. For when he read the book of Jeremiah the prophet, in which it was written that the sanctuary would be desolate seventy years, he made confession with fastings and supplications, and prayed that the people might return sooner from their captivity to the city Jerusalem. Thus, then, he speaks in his account: "In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was king over the realm of the Chaldeans, I Daniel understood in the books the number of the years, as the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem in seventy years," etc. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 11.

{Dan 9:23-25}
12. After his confession and supplication, the angel says to him, "You are a man greatly beloved:" for you desire to see things of which you shall be informed by me; and in their own time these things will be fulfilled; and he touched me, saying, "Seventy weeks are determined upon your people, and upon the holy city, to seal up sins and to blot out transgressions, and to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy; and you shall know and understand, that from the going forth of words for the answer, and for the building of Jerusalem, unto Christ the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 12.

{Dan 9:25; Jer 25:11-12}
13. Having mentioned therefore seventy weeks, and having divided them into two parts, in order that what was spoken by him to the prophet might be better understood, he proceeds thus, "Unto Christ the Prince shall be seven weeks," which make forty-nine years. It was in the twenty-first year that Daniel saw these things in Babylon. Hence, the forty-nine years added to the twenty-one, make up the seventy years, of which the blessed Jeremiah spoke: "The sanctuary shall be desolate seventy years from the captivity that befell them under Nebuchadnezzar; and after these things the people will return, and sacrifice and offering will be presented, when Christ is their Prince." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 13.


{Dan 9:25; 1 Sam 2:35}
14. Now of what Christ does he speak, but of Jesus the son of Josedech, who returned at that time along with the people, and offered sacrifice according to the law, in the seventieth year, when the sanctuary was built? For all the kings and priests were styled Christs, because they were anointed with the holy oil, which Moses of old prepared. These, then, bore the name of the Lord in their own persons, showing aforetime the type, and presenting the image until the perfect King and Priest appeared from heaven, who alone did the will of the Father; as also it is written in Kings: "And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do all things according to my heart."

{Dan 9:24-25; Jn 1:29; Eph 2:14; Col 2:14; Chronology}
15. In order, then, to show the time when He is to come whom the blessed Daniel desired to see, he says, "And after seven weeks there are other threescore and two weeks," which period embraces the space of 434 years. For after the return of the people from Babylon under the leadership of Jesus the son of Josedech, and Ezra the scribe, and Zerubbabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of David, there were 434 years unto the coming of Christ, in order that the Priest of priests might 181 be manifested in the world, and that He who taketh away the sins of the world might be evidently set forth, as John speaks concerning Him: "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!"1306 And in like manner Gabriel says: "To blot out transgressions, and make reconciliation for sins." But who has blotted out our transgressions? Paul the apostle teaches us, saying, "He is our peace who made both one;"1307 and then, "Blotting out the handwriting of sins that was against us."1308 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 15.


{Dan 9:24; Obedience, Role in Salvation; Chronology}
16. That transgressions, therefore, are blotted out, and that reconciliation is made for sins, is shown by this. But who are they who have reconciliation made for their sins, but they who believe on His name, and propitiate His countenance by good works? And that after the return of the people from Babylon there was a space of 434 years, until the time of the birth of Christ, may be easily understood. For, since the first covenant was given to the children of Israel after a period of 434 years, it follows that the second covenant also should be defined by the same space of time, in order that it might be expected by the people and easily recognized by the faithful. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 16.

{Dan 9:24; Isa 61:1; Lk 4:18}
17. And for this reason Gabriel says: "And to anoint the Most Holy." And the Most Holy is none else but the Son of God alone, who, when He came and manifested Himself, said to them, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me;" and so forth. Whosoever, therefore, believed on the heavenly Priest, were cleansed by that same Priest, and their sins were blotted out. And whosoever believed not on Him, despising Him as a man, had their sins sealed, as those which could not be taken away; whence the angel, foreseeing that not all should believe on Him, said, "To finish sins, and to seal up sins." For as many as continued to disbelieve Him, even to the end, had their sins not finished, but sealed to be kept for judgment. But as many as will believe on Him as One able to remit sins, have their sins blotted out. Wherefore he says: "And to seal up vision and prophet." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 17.

{Lk 13:15-16; Isa 49:9}
18. For when He came who is the fulfilling of the law and of the prophets (for the law and the prophets were till John), it was necessary that the things spoken by them should be confirmed (sealed), in order that at the coming of the Lord all things loosed should be brought to light, and that things bound of old should now be loosed by Him, as the Lord said Himself to the rulers of the people, when they were indignant at the cure on the Sabbath-day: "you  hypocrites, does not each one of you loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? and ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound these eighteen years, be loosed on the Sabbath-day?"1310 Whomsoever, therefore, Satan bound in chains, these did the Lord on His coming loose from the bonds of death, having bound our strong adversary and delivered humanity. As also Isaiah says: "Then will He say to those in chains, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves."1311  
1306 John i. 29. 1307 Eph. ii. 14. 1308 Col. ii. 14. 1309 Isa. lxi. 1; Luke iv. 18.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 18.

{Isa 29:11; Dan 12:9}
19. And that the things spoken of old by the law and the prophets were all sealed, and that they were unknown to men, Isaiah declares when he says: "And they will deliver the book that is sealed to one that is learned, and will say to him, Read this; and he will say, I cannot read it, for it is sealed."1312 It was fitting and necessary that the things spoken of old by the prophets should be sealed to the unbelieving Pharisees, who thought that they understood the letter of the law, and be opened to the believing. The things, therefore, which of old were sealed, are now by the grace of God the Lord all open to the saints. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 19.

{Rev 3:7; Rev 5:5; Mt 10:27; Dan 12:9}
20. For He was Himself the perfect Seal, and the Church is the key: "He who opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens,"1313 as John says. And again, the same says: "And I saw, on the right hand of Him that sat on the throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven seals; and I saw an angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?" and so forth. "And I beheld in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, a Lamb standing slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne. And when He had taken the book, the four beasts and four-and-twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having harps and golden vials full of incense, which is the prayers of the saints. And they sing a new song, saying, You are worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for You wast slain, and have redeemed us to God by your blood."1314 He took the book, therefore, and loosed it, in order that the things spoken concerning Him of old in secret, might now be proclaimed with boldness upon the house-tops.1315 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 20.

{Dan 12:4; Dan 9:25-27; Rev 5:5}
21. For this reason, then, the angel says to Daniel, "Seal the words, for the vision is until the end of the time." But to Christ it was not said "seal," but "loose" the things bound of old; in order that, by His grace, we might know the will of the Father, and believe upon Him whom He has sent for the salvation of men, Jesus our Lord. He says, therefore, "They shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall;" which in reality took place. For the people returned and built the city, and the temple, and the wall round about. Then he says: "After threescore and two weeks the times will be fulfilled, and one week will make a covenant with many; and in the midst (half) of the week sacrifice and oblation will be removed, and in the temple will be the abomination of desolations." 
1310 Luke xiii. 15, 16. 1311 Isa. xlix. 9. 1312 Isa. xxix. 11. 1313 Apoc. iii. 7. 1314 Apoc. v. 1315 Cf. Matt. x. 27.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 21.

{Dan 9:26-27; Chronology; End Times}
22. For when the threescore and two weeks are fulfilled, and Christ is come, and the Gospel is preached in every place, the times being then accomplished, there will remain only one week, the last, in which Elias will appear, and Enoch, and in the midst of it the abomination of desolation will be manifested,1316 viz., Antichrist, announcing desolation to the world. And when he comes, the sacrifice and oblation will be removed, which now are offered to God in every place by the nations. These things being thus recounted, the prophet again describes another vision to us. For he had no other care save to be accurately instructed in all things that are to be, and to prove himself an instructor in such. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 22.

{Dan 10:1-4}
23. He says then: "In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was Belshazzar; and the word was true, and great power and understanding were given him in the vision. In those days I Daniel was mourning three weeks of days. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three weeks of days were fulfilled. On the fourth day of the first month I humbled myself," says he, "one and twenty days," praying to the living God, and asking of Him the revelation of the mystery. And the Father in truth heard him, and sent His own Word, to show what should happen by Him. And that took place, indeed, by the great river. For it was meet that the Son should be manifested there, where also He was to remove sins. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 23.

{Dan 10:5}
24. "And I lifted up mine eyes," he says, "and, behold, a man clothed in linen."1317 In the first vision he says, "Behold, the angel Gabriel (was) sent." Here, however, it is not so; but he sees the Lord, not yet indeed as perfect man, but with the appearance and form of man, as he says: "And, behold, a man clothed in linen." For in being clothed in a various-colored coat, he indicated mystically1318 the variety of the graces of our calling. For the priestly coat was made up of different colours, as various nations waited for Christ's coming, in order that we might be made up (as one body) of many colours. "And his loins were girded with the gold of Ophaz." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 24.

{Dan 10:5-6}
25. Now the word "Ophaz," which is a word transferred from Hebrew to Greek, denotes pure gold. With a pure girdle, therefore, he was girded round the loins. For the Word was to bear us all, binding us like a girdle round His body, in His own love. The complete body was His,1319 but we are members in His body, united together, and sustained by the Word Himself. "And his body was like Tharses."1320 Now "Tharses," by interpretation, is "Ethiopians." For that it would be difficult 1316 to recognize Him, the prophet had thus already announced beforehand, intimating that He would be manifested in the flesh in the world, but that many would find it difficult to recognize Him. "And his face as lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire;" for it was meet that the fiery and judicial power of the Word should be signified aforetime, in the exercise of which He will cause the fire (of His judgment) to light with justice upon the impious, and consume them. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 25.

{Dan 10:6; Isa 1:26; Rev 19:6}
26. He added also these words: "And his arms and his feet like polished brass;" to denote the first calling of men, and the second calling like unto it, viz. of the Gentiles.1321 "For the last shall be as the first; for I will set your rulers as at the beginning, and your leaders as before. And His voice was as the voice of a great multitude."1322 For all we who believe on Him in these days utter things oracular, as speaking by His mouth the things appointed by Him. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 26.

{Dan 10:20; Dan 10:12}
27. And after a little He says to him: "Do you know from where I come unto you? And now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia. But I will show you that which is noted in the Scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things but Michael your prince, and I left him there. For from the day that you did give your countenance to be afflicted before the Lord your God, your prayer was heard, and I was sent to fight with the prince of Persia:" for a certain counsel was formed not to send the people away: "that therefore your prayer might be speedily granted, I withstood him, and left Michael there."  
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 27.

{Ex 32:4; Ex 33:3}
28. And who was he that spoke, but the angel who was given to the people, as he says in the law of Moses: "I will not go with you, because the people is stiff-necked; but my angel shall go before along with you?"1323 This (angel) withstood Moses at the inn, when he was bringing the child uncircumcised into Egypt. For it was not allowed Moses, who was the elder (or legate) and mediator of the law, and who proclaimed the covenant of the fathers, to introduce a child uncircumcised, lest he should be deemed a false prophet and deceiver by the people. "And now," says he, "will I show the truth to you." Could the Truth have shown anything else but the truth? 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 28.

{Dan 11:2-4}
29. He says therefore to him: "Behold, there shall stand up three kings in Persia: and the fourth shall be far richer than they all; and when he has got possession of his riches, he shall stand up against all the realms of Greece. And a mighty king shall stand up, and shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will; and when his kingdom stands, it shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven." These things we have already discussed above, when we discoursed upon the four beasts. But since Scripture now again sets them forth explicitly, we must also discourse upon them a second time, that we may not leave Scripture unused and unexplained. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 29.

{Dan 11:2-4}
30. "There shall stand up yet three kings," he says, "in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all." This has been fulfilled. For after Cyrus arose Darius, and then Artaxerxes. These were the three kings; (and) the Scripture is fulfilled. "And the fourth shall be far richer than they all." Who is that but Darius, who reigned and made himself glorious,--who was rich, and assailed all the realms of Greece? Against him rose Alexander of Macedon, who destroyed his kingdom; and after he had reduced the Persians, his own kingdom was divided toward the four winds of heaven. For Alexander at his death divided his kingdom into four principalities. "And a king shall stand up, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of Egypt." 
1321 Isa. i. 26. 1322 Apoc. xix. 6. 1323 Ex. xxxii. 4; xxxiii. 3.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 30.

{Dan 11:21-35}
31. For Antiochus became king of Syria. He held the sovereignty in the 107th year of the kingdom of the Greeks. And in those same times indeed he made war against Ptolemy king of Egypt, and conquered him, and won the power. On returning from Egypt he went up to Jerusalem, in the 103rd year, and carrying off with him all the treasures of the Lord's house, he marched to Antioch. And after two years of days the king sent his raiser of taxes1324 into the cities of Judea, to compel the Jews to forsake the laws of their fathers, and submit to the decrees of the king. And he came, and tried to compel them, saying, "Come forth, and do the commandment of the king, and you shall live." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 31.

{2 Macc 2:33; Dan 11:33}
32. But they said, "We will not come forth: neither will we do the king's commandment; we will die in our innocency: and he slew of them a thousand souls."1325 The things, therefore, which were spoken to the blessed Daniel are fulfilled: "And my servants shall be afflicted, and shall fall by famine, and by sword, and by captivity."1326 Daniel, however, adds: "And they shall be helped with a little help." For at that time Matthias arose, and Judas Maccabaeus, and helped them, and delivered them from the hand of the Greeks. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 32.

{Dan 11:6}
33. That therefore was fulfilled which was spoken in the Scripture. He proceeds then thus: "And the (king's) daughter of the South shall come to the king of the North to make an agreement with him; and the arms of him that bringeth her shall not stand; and she, too, shall be smitten, and shall fall, and he that bringeth her." For this was a certain Ptolemaïs,1327 queen of Egypt. At that time indeed she went forth with her two sons, Ptolemy and Philometor, to make an agreement with Antiochus king of Syria; and when she came to Scythopolis, she was slain there. For he who brought her betrayed her. At that same time, the two brothers made war against each other, and Philometor was slain, and Ptolemy gained the power. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 33.

{Dan 11:8; Dan 11:11}
34. War, then, was again made by Ptolemy against Antiochus, (and) Antiochus met him. For thus says the Scripture: "And the king of the South shall stand up against the king of the North, and her seed shall stand up against him." And what seed but Ptolemy, who made war with Antiochus? And Antiochus having gone forth against him, and having failed to overcome him, had to flee, and returned to Antioch, and collected a larger host. Ptolemy accordingly took his whole equipment, and carried it into Egypt. And the Scripture is fulfilled, as Daniel says: And he shall carry off into Egypt their gods, and their cast-works, and all their precious (vessels of) gold. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 34.

{Dan 11:6}
35. And after these things Antiochus went forth a second time to make war against him, and overcome Ptolemy. And after these events Antiochus commenced hostilities again against the children of Israel, and despatched one Nicanor with a large army to subdue the Jews, at the time 184 when Judas, after the death of Matthias, ruled the people; and so forth, as is written in the Maccabees. These events having taken place, the Scripture says again: "And there shall stand up another king, and he shall prevail upon the earth; and the king of the South shall stand up, and he shall obtain his daughter to wife." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 35.

{1 Macc 10:1; Dan 11:6; Dan 11:17; Dan 11:27}
36. For it happened that there arose a certain Alexander,1328 son of Philip. He withstood Antiochus1329 at that time, and made war upon him, and cut him off, and gained possession of the kingdom. Then he sent to Ptolemy king of Egypt, saying, Give me your daughter Cleopatra to wife. And he gave her to Alexander to wife. And thus the Scripture is fulfilled, when it says: "And he shall obtain his daughter to wife." And it says further: "And he shall corrupt her, and she shall not be his wife." This also has been truly fulfilled. For after Ptolemy had given him his daughter, he returned, and saw the mighty and glorious kingdom of Alexander. And coveting its possession, he spoke falsely to Alexander, as the Scripture says: "And the two kings shall speak lies at (one) table." And, in sooth, Ptolemy betook himself to Egypt, and collected a great army, and attacked the city at the time when Alexander had marched into Cilicia. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 36.

{Dan 11:17; Dan 11:21}
37. Ptolemy then invaded the country, and established garrisons throughout the cities; and on making himself master of Judea, set out for his daughter, and sent letters to Demetrius in the islands, saying, Come and meet me here, and I will give you my daughter Cleopatra to wife, for Alexander has sought to kill me. Demetrius came accordingly, and Ptolemy received him, and gave him her who had been destined for Alexander. Thus is fulfilled that which is written: "And he shall corrupt her, and she shall not be his wife." Alexander was slain. Then Ptolemy wore two crowns, that of Syria and that of Egypt, and died the third day after he had assumed them. Thus is fulfilled that which is written in Scripture: "And they shall not give him the glory of the kingdom." For he died, and received not honor from all as king. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 37.

{Dan 11:36; Dan 11:41-43}
38. The prophet then, after thus recounting the things which have taken place already, and been fulfilled in their times, declares yet another mystery to us, while he points out the last times. For he says: "And there shall rise up another shameless king; and he shall exalt himself above every god, and shall magnify himself, and shall speak marvellous things, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished;" and so forth. "And these shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief (or principality) of the children of Ammon. And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the land; and the land of Egypt shall not escape. And he shall have power over the secret treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt and of the Libyans, and the Ethiopians in their strongholds." 


1328 He refers to Alexander I. king of Syria, of whom we read in 1 Macc. x. He pretended to be the son of Antiochus Epiphanes, and even gained a decree of the senate of Rome in his favor as such. Yet he was a person of unknown origin, as indeed he acknowledged himself in his choice of the designation Theopator. Livy calls him "a man unknown, and of uncertain parentage" (homo ignotus et incertae stirpis). So Hippolytus calls him here, "a certain Alexander"). He had also other surnames, e.g., Euergetes, Balas, etc. 1329 For "Antiochus" in the text, read "Demetrius."
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 38.

{Rev 11:3; Dan 9:27; Antichrist; End Times}
39. Thus, then, does the prophet set forth these things concerning the Antichrist, who shall be shameless, a war-maker, and despot, who, exalting himself above all kings and above every god, shall build the city of Jerusalem, and restore the sanctuary. Him the impious will worship as God, and will bend to him the knee, thinking him to be the Christ. He shall cut off the two witnesses and forerunners of Christ, who proclaim His glorious kingdom from heaven, as it is said: "And I will give (power) unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth."1330 As also it was announced to Daniel: "And one week shall confirm a covenant with many; and in the midst of the week it shall be that the sacrifice and oblation shall be removed"--that the one week might be shown to be divided into two. The two witnesses, then, shall preach three years and a half; and Antichrist shall make war upon the saints during the rest of the week, and desolate the world, that what is written may be fulfilled: "And they shall make the abomination of desolation for a thousand two hundred and ninety days." 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 39.

{Dan 11:41; Isa 11:14; Dan 12:12; Antichrist; End Times}
40. Daniel has spoken, therefore, of two abominations; the one of destruction, and the other of desolation. What is that of destruction, but that which Antiochus established there at the time? And what is that of desolation, but that which shall be universal when Antichrist comes? "And there shall escape out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon." For these are they who ally themselves with him on account of their kinship, and first address him as king. Those of Edom are the sons of Esau, who inhabit Mount Seir. And Moab and Ammon are they who are descended from his two daughters, as Isaiah also says: "And they shall fly (extend themselves) in the ships of strangers, and they shall also plunder the sea; and those from the east, and from the west, and the north, shall give them honor: and the children of Ammon shall first obey them."1331 He shall be proclaimed king by them, and shall be magnified by all, and shall prove 185 himself an abomination of desolation to the world, and shall reign for a thousand two hundred and ninety days. "Blessed is he that waiteth, and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days;" for when the abomination comes and makes war upon the saints, whosoever shall survive his days, and reach the forty-five days, while the other period of fifty days advances, to him the kingdom of heaven comes. Antichrist, indeed, enters even into part of the fifty days, but the saints shall inherit the kingdom along with Christ. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 40.


{Dan 12:5-7}
41. These things being thus narrated, Daniel proceeds: "And, behold, there stood two men, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side; and they made answer to the man that stood upon the bank of the river, and said to him, How long shall it be to the end of these wonderful words which you have spoken? And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the water of the river; and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and they shall know all these things when the dispersion is accomplished." 
1330 Apoc. xi. 3. 1331 Isa. xi. 14.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 41.

{Dan 12:5-7}
42. Who, then, were the two men who stood on the bank of the river, but the Law and the Prophets? And who was he who stood upon the water, but He concerning whom they prophesied of old, who in the last times was to be borne witness to by the Father at the Jordan, and to be declared to the people boldly by John, "who wore the casty1332 of the scribe about his loins, and was clothed with a linen coat of various colours?" These, therefore, interrogate Him, knowing that to Him were given all government and power, in order to learn accurately of Him when He will bring the judgment on the world, and when the things spoken by Him will be fulfilled. And He, desiring by all means to convince them, lifted His right hand and His left hand to heaven, and swore by Him that lives forever. Who is He that swore, and by whom swore He? Manifestly the Son by the Father, saying, The Father lives forever, but in a time, and times, and an half, when the dispersion is accomplished, they shall know all these things. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 42.

{Dan 12:7; Mt 24:12; Chronology}
43. By the stretching forth of His two hands He signified His passion; and by mentioning "a time, and times, and an half, when the dispersion is accomplished," He indicated the three years and a half of Antichrist. For by "a time" He means a year, and by "times" two years, and by an "half time" half a year. These are the thousand two hundred and ninety days of which Daniel prophesied for the finishing of the passion, and the accomplishment of the dispersion when Antichrist comes. In those days they shall know all these things. And from the time of the removal of the continuous sacrifice there are also reckoned one thousand two hundred and ninety days. (Then) iniquity shall abound, as the Lord also says: "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."1333 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 43.


{Dan 12:12; Mt 10:22; Jn 8:12; End Times}
44. And that divisions will arise when the falling away takes place, is without doubt. And when divisions arise, love is chilled. The words, "Blessed is he that waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days," have also their value, as the Lord said: "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." Wherefore let us by no means admit the falling away, lest iniquity abound, and the abomination of desolation--that is, the adversary--overtake us. And He said to him, "unto evening"--that is, unto the consummation--"and morning." What is "morning?" The day of resurrection. For that is the beginning of another age, as the morning is the beginning of the day. And the thousand and four hundred days are the light of the world. For on the appearing of the light in the world (as He says, "I am the light of the world"), the sanctuary shall be purged, as he said,1334 (of) the adversary. For it cannot by any means be purged but by his destruction. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Daniel, Sec. II, ch. 44.


{Dan 1:1}
1335 1. "In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim." The Scripture narrates these things, with the purpose of intimating the second captivity of the people, when Jehoiakim and the three youths with him, together with Daniel, were taken captive and carried off. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. I, par. 1.

{Dan 1:2}
2. "And the Lord gave," etc. These words, "and the Lord gave," are written, that no one, in reading the preface to the book, may attribute their capture to the strength of the captors and the slackness of their chief. And it is well said, "with part," for the deportation was for the correction, not the ruin, of the whole nation, that there might be no misapplication of the cause. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. I, par.2

{Dan 1:8}
8. "And Daniel purposed in his heart." Oh, blessed are they who thus kept the covenant of the fathers, and transgressed not the law given by Moses, but feared the God proclaimed by him. These young captives in a strange land, were not seduced by delicate meats, nor were they slaves to the pleasures of wine, nor were they caught by the bait of princely glory. But they kept their mouths holy and pure, that pure speech might proceed from pure mouths, and praise with such (mouths) the heavenly Father. 186 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. I, par.8.


{Dan 1:12}
12. "Prove now your servants." They teach that it is not earthly meats that give to men their beauty and strength, but the grace of God bestowed by the Word. "And after a little." You have seen the incorruptible faith of the youths, and the unalterable fear of God. They asked an interval of ten days, to prove therein that man cannot otherwise find grace with God than by believing the word preached by the Lord. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. I, par.12.

{Dan 1:19}
19. "And among them all, was found none like Daniel." These men, who were proved faithful witnesses in Babylon, were led by the Word in all wisdom, that by their means the idols of the Babylonians should be put to shame, and that Nebuchadnezzar should be overcome by three youths, and that by their faith the fire in the furnace should be kept at bay, and the desire of the wicked elders (or chiefs) proved vain. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. I, par.19.

{Dan 2:3}
3. "I have dreamed a dream." The dream, then, which was seen by the king was not an earthly dream, so that it might be interpreted by the wise of the world; but it was a heavenly dream, fulfilled in its proper times, according to the counsel and foreknowledge of God. And for this reason it was kept secret from men who think of earthly things, that to those who seek after heavenly things heavenly mysteries might be revealed. And, indeed, there was a similar case in Egypt in the time of Pharaoh and Joseph. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.3.

{Dan 2:5}
5. "The thing is gone from me." For this purpose was the vision concealed from the king, that he who was chosen of God., viz., Daniel, might be shown to be a prophet. For when things concealed from some are revealed by another, he who tells them is of necessity shown to be a prophet. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.5.

{Dan 2:10}
10. "And they say, There is not a man." Whereas, therefore, they declared it to be impossible that what was asked by the king should be told by man; God showed them, that what is impossible with man is possible with God. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.10.

{Dan 2:14}
14. "Arioch, the captain of the king's guard" (literally, "the chief slaughterer or cook"). For as the cook slays all animals and cooks them, of a similar nature was his occupation. And the rulers of the world slay men, butchering them like brute beasts. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.14.

{Dan 2:23; Hos 14:9}
23. "Because You have given me wisdom and might." We ought therefore to mark the goodness of God, how He straightway reveals and shows (Himself) to the worthy, and to those that fear Him, fulfilling their prayers and supplications, as the prophet says: "Who is wise, and he shall understand these things, and prudent, and he shall know them?"1336 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.23.


{Dan 2:27}
27. "Cannot the wise men, the magicians." He instructs the king not to seek an explanation of heavenly mysteries from earthly men, for they shall be accomplished in their due time by God. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.27

{Dan 2:29}
29. "As for you, O king, your thoughts." For the king, on making himself master of the land of Egypt, and getting hold of the country of Judea, and carrying off the people, thought upon his bed what should be after these things; and He who knows the secrets of all, and searches the thoughts of the hearts, revealed to him by means of the image the things that were to be. And He hid from him the vision, in order that the counsels of God might not be interpreted by the wise men of Babylon, but that by the blessed Daniel, as a prophet of God, things kept secret from all might be made manifest. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.29.


{Dan 2:31}
31. "Behold a great image." How, then, should we not mark the things prophesied of old in Babylon by Daniel, and now yet in the course of fulfilment in the world? For the image shown at that time to Nebuchadnezzar furnished a type of the whole world. In these times the Babylonians were sovereign over all, and these were the golden head of the image. And then, after them, the Persians held the supremacy for 245 years, and they were represented by the silver. Then the Greeks had the supremacy, beginning with Alexander of Macedon, for 300 years, so that they were the brass. After them came the Romans, who were the iron legs of the image, for they were strong as iron. Then (we have) the toes of clay and iron, to signify the democracies that were subsequently to rise, partitioned among the ten toes of the image, in which shall be iron mixed with clay. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.31.

Note by the compiler: Eusebius Pamphili and Hippolytus the most holy bishop of Rome, compare the dream of Nebuchadnezzar now in question with the vision of the prophet Daniel. Since these have given a different interpretation of this vision now before us in their expositions, I deemed it necessary to transcribe what is said by Eusebius of Caesarea, who bears the surname Pamphili, in the 15th book of his Gospel Demonstration;1337 for he expounds the whole vision in these terms: 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II

{Dan 2:31-34}
Eusebius: "I think that this (i.e., the vision of Nebuchadnezzar) differs in nothing from the vision of the prophet. For as the prophet saw a great sea, so the king saw a great image. And again, as the prophet saw four beasts, which he interpreted as four kingdoms, so the king was given to understand four kingdoms under the gold, and silver, and brass, and iron. And again, as the prophet saw the division of the ten horns of the last beast, and three horns broken by one; so the king, in like manner, saw in the extremities of the image one part iron and another clay. And besides this, as the prophet, after the vision of the four kingdoms, saw the Son of man receive dominion, and power, and a kingdom; so also the king thought he saw a stone smite the whole image, and become a great mountain and fill the sea. And rightly so. For it was quite consistent in the king, whose view of the spectacle of life was so false, and who admired the beauty of the mere sensible colours, so to speak, in the picture set up to view, to liken the life of all men to a great image; but (it became) the prophet to compare the great and mighty tumult of life to a mighty sea. And it was fitting that the king, who prized the substances deemed precious among men, gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, should liken to these substances the kingdoms that held the sovereignty at different times in the life of men; but that the prophet should describe these same kingdoms under the likeness of beasts, in accordance with the manner of their rule. And again, the king--who was puffed up, as it seems, in his own conceit, and plumed himself on the power of his ancestors--is shown the vicissitude to which affairs are subject, and the end destined for all the kingdoms of earth, with the view of teaching him to lay aside his pride in himself, and understand that there is nothing stable among men, but only that which is the appointed end of all things--the kingdom of God. For after the first kingdom of the Assyrians, which was denoted by the gold, there will be the second kingdom of the Persians, expressed by the silver; and then the third kingdom of the Macedonians, signified by the brass; and after it, the fourth kingdom of the Romans will succeed, more powerful than those that went before it; for which reason also it was likened to iron. For of it is said: "And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; as iron breaks and subdues all things, so shall it break and subdue all things." And after all these kingdoms which have been mentioned, the kingdom of God is represented by the stone that breaks the whole image. And the prophet, in conformity with this, does not see the kingdom which comes at the end of all these things, until he has in order described the four dominions mentioned under the four beasts. And I think that the visions shown, both to the king and to the prophet, were visions of these four kingdoms alone, and of none others, because by these the nation of the Jews was held in bondage from the times of the prophet." [end of Eusebius]
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II
1336 Hos. xiv. 9.

{Dan 2:33}
33. "His feet," etc.: In the vision of the prophet, the ten horns are the things that are yet to be. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.33.

{Dan 2:34}
34. "You saw till that a stone was cut." You saw, as it were, a stone cut without hands, and smiting the image upon its feet. For the human kingdom was decisively separated from the divine; with reference to which it is written, "as it were cut." The stroke, however, smites the extremities, and in these it broke all dominion that is upon earth. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.34.

{Dan 2:45}
45. "And the dream is certain." That no one, therefore, may have any doubt whether the things announced shall turn out so or not, the prophet has confirmed them with the words, "And the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure;" I have not erred in the interpretation of the vision. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.45.

{Dan 2:46; Ex 7:1}
46. "Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face." Nebuchadnezzar hearing these things, and being put in remembrance of his vision, knew that what was spoken by Daniel was true. How great is the power of the grace of God, beloved, that one who a little before was doomed to death with the other wise men of Babylon, should now be worshipped by the king, not as man, but as God! "He commanded that they should offer manaa"1338 (i.e., in Chaldee, "oblation") "and sweet odours unto him." Of old, too, the Lord made a similar announcement to Moses, saying, "See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh;"1339 in order that, on account of the signs wrought by him in the land of Egypt, Moses might no longer be reckoned a man, but be worshipped as a god by the Egyptians. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.46.

{Dan 2:48; Gen 41:41-43}
48. "Then the king made Daniel a great man." For as he had humbled himself, and presented himself as the least among all men, God made him great, and the king established him as ruler over the whole land of Babylon. Just as also Pharaoh did to Joseph, appointing him then to be ruler over the whole land of Egypt. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.48.

{Dan 2:49}
49. "And Daniel requested," etc. For as they had united with Daniel in prayer to God that the vision might be revealed to him, so Daniel, when he obtained great honor from the king, made mention of them, explaining to the king what had been done by them, in order that they also should be deemed worthy of some honor as fellow-seers and worshippers of God. For when they asked heavenly things from the Lord, they received also earthly things from the king. 188 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. II, par.49.

{Dan 2:38}
1. "In the eighteenth year," etc. A considerable space of time having elapsed, therefore, and the eighteenth year being now in its course, the king, calling to mind his vision, "made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits." For as the blessed Daniel, in interpreting the vision, had answered the king, saying, "You are this head of gold in the image," the king, being puffed up with this address, and elated in heart, made a copy of this image, in order that he might be worshipped by all as God. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.1.

{Dan 3:7}
7. "All the people fell." Some (did so) because they feared the king himself; but all (or "most"), because they were idolaters, obeyed the word commanded by the king. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.7.

{Dan 3:16}
16. "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered," etc. These three youths are become an example to all faithful men, inasmuch as they did not fear the crowd of satraps, neither did they tremble when they heard the king's words, nor did they shrink when they saw the flame of the blazing furnace, but deemed all men and the whole world as nought, and kept the fear of God alone before their eyes. Daniel, young he stood at a distance and kept silence, encouraged them to be of good cheer as he smiled to them. And he rejoiced also himself at the witness they bore, understanding, as he did, that the three youths would receive a crown in triumph over the devil.
1338 [The minchah, that is.] 1339 Ex. vii. 1.
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.16.

{Dan 3:19}
19. "And commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more." He bids the vast furnace be heated one seven times more, as if he were already overcome by them. In earthly things, then, the king was superior; but in faith toward God the three youths were superior. Tell me, Nebuchadnezzar, with what purpose you order them to be cast into the fire bound? Is it lest they might escape, if they should have their feet unbound, and thus be able to extinguish the fire? But you do not do these things of yourself, but there is another who works these things by your means. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.19.


{Prayer of Azariah 1:24}
47.1340 "And the flame streamed forth." The fire, he means, was driven from within by the angel, and burst forth outwardly. See how even the fire appears intelligent, as if it recognized and punished the guilty. For it did not touch the servants of God, but it consumed the unbelieving and impious Chaldeans. Those who were within were besprinkled with a (cooling) dew by the angel, while those who thought they stood in safety outside the furnace were destroyed by the fire. The men who cast in the youths were burned by the flame, which caught them on all sides, as I suppose, when they went to bind the youths. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.47.

{Dan 3:25; Prov 21:1}
92 (i.e., 25). "And the form of the fourth is like the Son of God." Tell me, Nebuchadnezzar, when did you see the Son of God, that you should confess that this is the Son of God? And who pricked your heart, that you should utter such a word? And with what eyes wert you able to look into this light? And why was this manifested to you alone, and to none of the satraps about you? But, as it is written, "The heart of a king is in the hand of God:" the hand of God is here, whereby the Word pricked his heart, so that he might recognize Him in the furnace, and glorify Him. And this idea of ours is not without good ground. For as the children of Israel were destined to see God in the world, and yet not to believe on Him, the Scripture showed beforehand that the Gentiles would recognize Him incarnate, whom, while not incarnate, Nebuchadnezzar saw and recognized of old in the furnace, and acknowledged to be the Son of God. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.92.

{Dan 3:26}
93. (i.e., 26). "And he said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego." The three youths he thus called by name. But he found no name by which to call the fourth. For He was not yet that Jesus born of the virgin. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.93.

{Dan 3:30}
97. (i.e., 30). "Then the king promoted," etc. For as they honored God by giving themselves up to death, so, too, they were themselves honored not only by God, but also by the king. And they taught strange and foreign nations also to worship God. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. III, par.97.

{Dan 7:1}
1. "And he wrote the dream." The things, therefore, which were revealed to the blessed prophet by the Spirit in visions, these he also recounted fully for others, that he might not appear to prophesy of the future to himself alone, but might be proved a prophet to others also, who wish to search the divine Scriptures. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.1.

{Dan 7:2}
2. "And behold the four winds." He means created existence in its fourfold division. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.2.

{Dan 7:3}
3. "And four great beasts." As various beasts then were shown to the blessed Daniel, and these different from each other, we should understand that the truth of the narrative deals not with certain beasts, but, under the type and image of different beasts, exhibits the kingdoms that have risen in this world in power over the race of man. For by the great sea he means the whole world. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.3.

{Dan 7:4}
4. "Till the wings thereof were plucked." For this happened in reality in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, as has been shown in the preceding book. And he bears witness directly that this very thing was fulfilled in himself; for he was driven out of the kingdom, and stripped of his glory, 189 and of the greatness which he formerly possessed. "And after a little:" the words, "It was made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it," signify that Nebuchadnezzar, when he humbled himself, and acknowledged that he was but a man, in subjection under the power of God, and made supplication to the Lord, found mercy with Him, and was restored to his own kingdom and honor. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.4.

{Dan 7:5}
5. "A second beast like to a bear." To represent the kingdom of the Persians. "And it had three ribs." The three nations he calls three ribs. The meaning, therefore, is this: that beast had the dominion, and these others under it were the Medes, Assyrians, and Babylonians. "And they said thus to it, Arise, devour." For the Persians arising in these times, devastated every land, and made many men subject to them, and slew them. For as this beast, the bear, is a foul animal, and carnivorous, tearing with claws and teeth, such also was the kingdom of the Persians, who held the supremacy for two hundred and thirty years. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.5.

{Dan 7:6}
6. "And, lo, another beast like a leopard." In mentioning a leopard, he means the kingdom of the Greeks, over whom Alexander of Macedon was king. And he likened them to a leopard, because they were quick and inventive in thought, and bitter in heart, just as that animal is many-coloured in appearance, and quick in wounding and in drinking man's blood. "The beast had also four heads." When the kingdom of Alexander was exalted, and grew, and acquired a name over the whole world, his kingdom was divided into four principalities. For Alexander, when near his end, partitioned his kingdom among his four comrades of the same race, viz., "Seleucus, Demetrius, Ptolemy, and Philip;" and all these assumed crowns, as Daniel prophesies, and as it is written in the first book of Maccabees. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.6.

{Dan 7:7}
7. "And behold a fourth beast." Now, that there has arisen no other kingdom after that of the Greeks except that which stands sovereign at present, is manifest to all. This one has iron teeth, because it subdues and reduces all by its strength, just as iron does. And the rest it did tread with its feet, for there is no other kingdom remaining after this one, but from it will spring ten horns. "And it had ten horns." For as the prophet said already of the leopard, that the beast had four heads, and that was fulfilled, and Alexander's kingdom was divided into four principalities, so also now we ought to look for the ten horns which are to spring from it, when the time of the beast shall be fulfilled, and the little horn, which is Antichrist, shall appear suddenly in their midst, and righteousness shall be banished from the earth, and the whole world shall reach its consummation. So that we ought not to anticipate the counsel of God, but exercise patience and prayer, that we fall not on such times. We should not, however, refuse to believe that these things will come to pass. For if the things which the prophets predicted in former times have not been realized, then we need not look for these things. But if those former things did happen in their proper seasons, as was foretold, these things also shall certainly be fulfilled. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.7.

{Dan 7:8}
8. "I considered the horns." That is to say, I looked intently at the beast, and was astonished at everything about it, but especially at the number of the horns. For the appearance of this beast differed from that of the other beasts in kind. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.8.

{Dan 7:13; Rev 1:13}
13. "And came to the Ancient of days." By the Ancient of days he means none other than the Lord and God and Ruler of all, and even of Christ Himself, who makes the days old, and yet becomes not old Himself by times and days. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.13.

{Dan 7:14; Dan 2:44; Descent into Hades; Mt 28:18}
14. "His dominion is an everlasting dominion." The Father, having put all things in subjection to His own Son, both things in heaven and things on earth, showed Him forth by all as the first-begotten of God, in order that, along with the Father, He might be approved the Son of God before angels, and be manifested as the Lord also of angels: (He showed Him forth also as) the first-begotten of a virgin, that He might be seen to be in Himself the Creator anew of the first-formed Adam, (and) as the first-begotten from the dead, that He might become Himself the first-fruits of our resurrection. "Which shall not pass away." He exhibited all the dominion given by the Father to His own Son, who is manifested as King of all in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, and as Judge of all: of all in heaven, because He was born the Word, of the heart of the Father before all; and of all in earth, because He was made man, and created Adam anew of Himself; and of all under the earth, because He was also numbered among the dead, and preached to the souls of the saints, (and) by death overcame death. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.14.

{Dan 7:17; 2 Thess 1:7-10; End Times}
17. "Which shall arise." For when the three beasts have finished their course, and been removed, and the one still stands in vigor,--if this one, too, is removed, then finally earthly things (shall) end, and heavenly things begin; that the indissoluble and everlasting kingdom of the saints may be brought to view, and the heavenly King manifested to all, no longer in figure, like one seen in vision, or revealed in a pillar of cloud upon the top of a mountain, but amid the powers and armies of angels, as God incarnate and man, Son of God and Son of man--coming from heaven as the world's Judge. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.17.

{Dan 7:19; Rev 13:7-8; Antichrist; End Times}
19. "And I inquired about the fourth beast." It is to the fourth kingdom, of which we have already spoken, that he here refers: that kingdom, than which no greater kingdom of like nature has arisen upon the earth; from which also ten horns are to spring, and to be apportioned among ten crowns. And amid these another little horn shall rise, which is that of Antichrist. And it shall pluck by the roots the three others before it; that is to say, he shall subvert the three kings of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, with the view of acquiring for himself universal dominion. And after conquering the remaining seven horns, he will at last begin, inflated by a strange and wicked spirit, to stir up war against the saints, and to persecute all everywhere, with the aim of being glorified by all, and being worshipped as God. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.19.

{Dan 7:22; End Times}
22. "Until the Ancient of days come." That is, when at length the Judge of judges and the King of kings comes from heaven, who shall subvert the whole dominion and power of the adversary, and shall consume all with the eternal fire of punishment. But to His servants, and prophets, and martyrs, and to all who fear Him, He will give an everlasting kingdom; that is, they shall possess the endless enjoyment of good. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.22.

{Dan 7:25}
25. "Until a time, and times, and the dividing of time." This denotes three years and a half. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. VII, par.25.

{Dan 9:21}
21. "And, behold, the man Gabriel. . .flying." You see how the prophet likens the speed of the angels to a winged bird, on account of the light and rapid motion with which these spirits fly so quickly in discharge of orders. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. IX, par.21.

{Dan 10:6}
6. "And the voice of His words." For all we who now believe on Him declare the words of Christ, as if we spoke by His mouth the things enjoined by Him. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.6.

{Dan 10:7}
7. "And I saw," etc. For it is to His saints that fear Him, and to them alone, that He reveals Himself. For if anyone seems to be living now in the Church, and yet has not the fear of God, his companionship with the saints will avail him nothing. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.7.

{Dan 10:12; Jas 5:16}
12. "Thy words were heard." Behold how much the piety of a righteous man avails, that to him alone, as to one worthy, things not yet to be manifested in the world should be revealed. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.12.

{Dan 10:13; Ex 33:3; Michael}
13. "And lo, Michael." Who is Michael but the angel assigned to the people? As (God) says to Moses, "I will not go with you in the way, because the people are stiff-necked; but my angel shall go with you." 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.13.

{Dan 10:16; 2 Cor 4:14}
16. "My inwards are turned" (A.V., "my sorrows are turned upon me"). For it was meet that, at the appearing of the Lord, what was above should be turned beneath, in order that also what was beneath might come above.--I require time, he says, to recover myself, and to be able to endure the words and to make reply to what is said.--But while I was in this position, he continues, I was strengthened beyond my hope. For one unseen touched me, and straightway my weakness was removed, and I was restored to my former strength. For whenever all the strength of our life and its glory pass from us, then are we strengthened by Christ, who stretches forth His hand and raises the living from among the dead, and as it were from Hades itself, to the resurrection of life. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.16.

{Dan 10:18}
18. "And he strengthened me." For whenever the Word has made us of good hope with regard to the future, we are able also readily to hear His voice. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.18.

{Dan 10:20}
20. "To fight with the prince of Persia." For from the day that you do humble yourself before the Lord your God your prayer was heard, and I was sent "to fight with the prince of Persia." For there was a design not to let the people go. Therefore, that your prayer might be speedily answered, "I stood up against him." 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. X, par.20.

{Dan 12:1; Mt 24:21; Mk 13:19; Rev 16:18; End Times}
1. "There shall be a time of trouble." For at that time there shall be great trouble, such as has not been from the foundation of the world, when some in one way, and others in another, shall be sent through every city and country to destroy the faithful; and the saints shall travel from the west to the east, and shall be driven in persecution from the east to the south, while others shall conceal themselves in the mountains and caves; and the abomination shall war against them everywhere, and shall cut them off by sea and by land by his decree, and shall endeavor by every means to destroy them out of the world; and they shall not be able any longer to sell their own property, nor to buy from strangers, unless one keeps and carries with him the name of the beast, or bears its mark upon his forehead. For then they shall all be driven out from every place, and dragged from their own homes and haled into prison, and punished with all manner of punishment, and cast out from the whole world. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. XII, par.1.

{Dan 12:2; Isa 26:19; Ezek 37:12-14; Mt 25:46}
2. "These shall awake to everlasting life." That is, those who have believed in the true life, and who have their names written in the book of life. "And these to shame." That is, those who are attached to Antichrist, and who are cast with him into everlasting punishment. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. XII, par.2.

{Dan 12:3; Mt 13:43}
3. "And they that be wise shall shine." And the Lord has said the same thing in the Gospel: "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun."1341 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. XII, par.3.


{Dan 12:7; Antichrist}
7. "For a time, times, and an half." By this he indicated the three and a half years of Antichrist. 191 For by a time he means a year; and by times, two years; and by a half time, half a year. These are the "one thousand two hundred and ninety days" of which Daniel prophesied. 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. XII, par.7.

{Dan 12:9; Mt 25:1-13; Rev 19:7}
9. "The words are closed up and sealed." For as a man cannot tell what God has prepared for the saints; for neither has eye seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man (to conceive) these things, into which even the saints, too, shall then eagerly desire to look; so He said to him, "For the words are sealed until the time of the end; until many shall be chosen and tried with fire." And who are they who are chosen, but those who believe the word of truth, so as to be made white thereby, and to cast off the filth of sin, and put on the heavenly, pure, and glorious Holy Spirit, in order that, when the Bridegroom comes, they may go in straightway with Him? 
Hippolytus, Scholia on Daniel, ch. XII, par.9.

{Dan 12:11; End Times}
11. "The abomination of desolation shall be given (set up)." Daniel speaks, therefore, of two abominations: the one of destruction, which Antiochus set up in its appointed time, and which bears a relation to that of desolation, and the other universal, when Antichrist shall come. For, as Daniel says, he too shall be set up for the destruction of many.1342

{Dan 3:25}
 "O Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, bless you  the Lord; O you apostles, prophets, and martyrs of the Lord, bless you the Lord: praise Him, and exalt Him above all, forever." We may well marvel at the words of the three youths in the furnace, how they enumerated all created things, so that not one of them might be reckoned free and independent in itself; but, summing up and naming them all together, both things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, they showed them to be all the servants of God, who created all things by the Word, that no one should boast that any of the creatures was without birth and beginning.

{Preface to Susannah}
What is narrated here, happened at a later time, although it is placed before the first book (at the beginning of the book). For it was a custom with the writers to narrate many things in an inverted order in their writings. For we find also in the prophets some visions recorded among the first and fulfilled among the last; and again, on the other hand, some recorded among the last and fulfilled first. And this was done by the disposition of the Spirit, that the devil might not understand the things spoken in parables by the prophets, and might not a second time lay his snares and ruin man. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, preface.

{2 Kings 22:8; Jer 43:8; Susannah 1:2}
1. "Called Joacim." This Joacim, being a stranger in Babylon, obtains Susannah in marriage. And she was the daughter of Chelcias the priest,1347 who found the book of the law in the house of the Lord, when Josiah the king commanded him to purify the holy of holies. His brother was Jeremiah the prophet, who was carried, with the remnant that was left after the deportation of the people to Babylon, into Egypt, and dwelt in Taphnae;1348 and, while prophesying there, he was stoned to death by the people. "A very fair woman, and one that feared the Lord," etc. For by the fruit produced, the tree also is easily known. For men who are pious and zealous for the law, bring into the world children worthy of God; such as he was who became a prophet and witness of Christ, and she who was found chaste and faithful in Babylon, whose honor and chastity were the occasion of the manifestation of the blessed Daniel as a prophet.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 1.
 
{Susannah 1:4}
4. "Now Joacim was a great rich man," etc. We must therefore seek the explanation of this. For how could those who were captives, and had been made subject to the Babylonians, meet together in the same place, as if they were their own masters? In this matter, therefore, we should observe 192 that Nebuchadnezzar, after their deportation, treated them kindly, and permitted them to meet together, and do all things according to the law. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 4.

{Susannah 1:7}
7. "And at noon Susannah went into (her husband's garden)." Susannah prefigured the Church; and Joacim, her husband, Christ; and the garden, the calling of the saints, who are planted like fruitful trees in the Church. And Babylon is the world; and the two elders are set forth as a figure of the two peoples that plot against the Church--the one, namely, of the circumcision, and the other of the Gentiles. For the words, "were appointed rulers of the people and judges," (mean) that in this world they exercise authority and rule, judging the righteous unrighteously. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 7.

{Susannah 1:8; Apocrypha; Canon, Old Testament}
8. "And the two elders saw her." These things the rulers of the Jews wish now to expunge from the book, and assert that these things did not happen in Babylon, because they are ashamed of what was done then by the elders. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 8.

{Susannah 1:9}
9. "And they perverted their own mind." For how, indeed, can those who have been the enemies and corruptors of the Church judge righteously, or look up to heaven with pure heart, when they have become the slaves of the prince of this world? 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 9.

{Susannah 1:10}
10. "And they were both wounded with her (love)." This word is to be taken in truth; for always the two peoples, being wounded (instigated) by Satan working in them, strive to raise persecutions and afflictions against the Church, and seek how they may corrupt her, young they do not agree with each other. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 10.

{Susannah 1:12; Gal 2:4}
12. "And they watched diligently." And this, too, is to be noted. For up to the present time both the Gentiles and the Jews of the circumcision watch and busy themselves with the dealings of the Church, desiring to suborn false witnesses against us, as the apostle says: "And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus."1349  It is a kind of sin to be anxious to give the mind to [gazing at] women. 
1347 2 Kings xxii. 8. 1348 Jer. xliii. 8.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 12.

{Susannah 1:14}
14. "And when they were gone out, they parted the one from the other." As to their parting the one from the other at the hour of dinner (luncheon), this signifies that in the matter of earthly meats the Jews and the Gentiles are not at one; but in their views, and in all worldly matters, they are of one mind, and can meet each other. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 14.

{Susannah 1:14; Prov 1:32}
14. "And asking one another, they acknowledged their lust." Thus, in revealing themselves to each other, they foreshadow the time when they shall be proved by their thoughts, and shall have to give account to God for all the sin which they have done, as Solomon says: "And scrutiny shall destroy the ungodly."1350 For these are convicted by the scrutiny. 
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 14.

{Susannah 1:15; Baptism}
15. "As they watched a fit time." What fit time but that of the Passover, at which the laver is prepared in the garden for those who burn, and Susannah washes herself, and is presented as a pure bride to God? "With two maids only." For when the Church desires to take the laver according to use, she must of necessity have two handmaids to accompany her. For it is by faith on Christ and love to God that the Church confesses and receives the laver.  
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 15.

{Susannah 1:22}
22. Behold the words of a chaste woman, and one dear to God: "I am confined on every side." For the Church is afflicted and confined, not only by the Jews, but also by the Gentiles, and by those who are called Christians--but are not such in reality. For, observing her chaste and happy life, they strive to ruin her.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 22.

{Susannah 1:31; 1 Pet 3:4; 2 Kings 9:30}
31. "Now Susannah was a very delicate woman." Not that she had tawdry adornments about her person, as Jezebel had, or eyes painted with various colors. Rather, that she had the adornment of faith, chastity, and sanctity.
Hippolytus, Commentary on Susannah, par 31.

{Susannah 1:55; Tob 3:25}
55. "For even now the angel of God." He shows also that when Susannah prayed to God and was heard, the angel was then sent to help her, just as was the case in the instance of Tobias and Sara. For when they prayed, the supplication of both of them was heard in the same day and the same hour. And the angel Raphael was sent to heal them both.

{Gen 2:8; Gen 2:10-14}
Now these things we are under the necessity of setting forth at length, in order to disprove the supposition of others. For some choose to maintain that paradise [Garden of Eden] is in heaven, and forms no part of the system of creation. But since we see with our eyes the rivers that go forth from it which are open, indeed, even in our day, to the inspection of any who choose, let everyone conclude from this that it did not belong to heaven, but was in reality planted in the created system. And, in truth, it is a locality in the east, and a place select.

Issachar desired the good part, resting in the midst of the lots. And seeing that rest was good, and that the land was fat, he set his shoulder to toil, and became a husbandman." Hippolytus:  That is, his eyes are brilliant as with the word of truth; for they regard all who believe upon Him. And his teeth are white as milk;--that denotes the luminous power of his words: for this reason he calls them white, and compares them to milk, as that which nourishes the flesh and the soul. And Zebulun is, by interpretation, "fragrance" and "blessing."

Gen. xlix. 27 "Benjamin is a ravening wolf; in the morning he shall devour still, and till evening he apportions food." Hippolytus: This thoroughly suits Paul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin. For when he was young, he was a ravening wolf; but when he believed, he "apportioned" food. This also is shown us by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that the tribe of Benjamin is among the first persecutors, which is the sense of "in the morning." For Saul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin, persecuted David, who was appointed to be a type of the Lord.  (ANF p. 168)

{1 Sam 28:17-19}
The question is raised, whether Samuel rose by the hand of the sorceress or not. And if, indeed, we were to allow that he did rise, we should be propounding what is false. For how could a demon call back the soul, I say not of a righteous man merely, but of anyone whatever, when it had gone, and was tarrying one knew not where? But he says, how then was the woman dismayed, and how did she see in an extraordinary way men ascending? For if her vision had not been of an extraordinary kind, she would not have said, "I see gods ascending out of the earth." She invoked one, and how did there ascend many? What then? Shall we say that the souls of all who appeared ascended, and those, too, not invoked by the woman; or that what was seen was merely phantasms of them? Even this, however, will not suffice. How, he urges further, did Saul recognize (what appeared) and do obeisance? Well, Saul did not actually see, but only, on being told by the woman that the figure of one of those who ascended was the figure he desired, and taking it to be Samuel, he consulted it as such, and did it obeisance. And it could be no difficult matter for the demon to conjure up the form of Samuel, as it was known to him. How then, says he, did he foretell the calamities that were to befall Saul and Jonathan at the same time? He did foretell indeed the end of the war, and how Saul would be overcome, drawing that as an inference from the wrath of God against him. Just as a physician, who has no exact knowledge of the science, might yet, seeing a patient past cure, tell of his death, though he made an error as to the hour, so, too, the demon, knowing the wrath of God by Saul's deeds, and by this very attempt to consult the sorceress, foretells his defeat and his death at the same time, though in error as to the day of his death.

{Preface to Psalms}
The book of Psalms contains new teaching after the Law of Moses. And after the writing of
Moses, it is the second book of doctrine. Now, after the death of Moses and Joshua, and after the judges, arose David, who was deemed worthy of bearing the name of father of the Savior himself; and he first gave to the Hebrews a new style of psalmody, by which he abrogates the ordinances established by Moses with respect to sacrifices [??] and introduces the new hymn and a new style of jubilant praise in the worship of God; and throughout his whole ministry he teaches very many other things that went beyond the Law of Moses.

For by this was signified the imperishable and incorruptible tabernacle of (the Lord) Himself, which gendered no corruption of sin. For the sinner, indeed, makes this confession: "My wounds stank, and were corrupt, because of my foolishness." But the Lord was without sin, made of imperishable wood, as regards His humanity; that is, of the virgin and the Holy Ghost inwardly, and outwardly of the Word of God, like an ark overlaid with purest gold.

Hippolytus, Commentary on Psalm 78

{Ps 78:47-48; Ps 105:32; Ex 9:23; Ps 36:6; Jacob; Symmachus}
[Concerning the hail]: Symmachus renders it: "Who gave up their cattle to the plague, and their possessions to birds." For, having met an overwhelming overthrow, they became a prey for carnivorous birds. But, according to the Seventy, the sense is not that the hail destroyed their cattle, and the fire the rest of their substance, but that hail, falling in an extraordinary manner along with fire, destroyed utterly their vines and sycamines first of all, which were entirely unable to stand out against the first attack; then the cattle which grazed on the plains; and then every herb and tree, which the fire accompanying the hail consumed; and the affair was altogether portentous, as fire ran with the water, and was commingled with it. "For fire ran in the hail," he says; and it was thus hail, and fire burning in the hail. David also calls the cattle and the fruit of the trees "substance," or "riches." And it should be observed that, though the hail is recorded to have destroyed every herb and every tree, yet there were left some which the locust, as it came upon them after the fiery hail, consumed; of which it is said, that it eats up every herb, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail left behind it. Now, in a spiritual sense, there are some sheep belonging to Christ, and others belonging to the Egyptians. Those, however, which once belonged to others may become His, as the sheep of Laban became Jacob's; and contrariwise. Whichever of the sheep, moreover, Jacob rejected, he made over to Esau. Beware, then, lest, being found in the flock of Jesus, you be set apart when gifts are sent to Esau, and be given over to Esau as reprobate and unworthy of the spiritual Jacob. The single-minded are the sheep of Christ, and these God saves according to the word: "O Lord, you preservest man and beast." They who in their folly attach themselves to godless doctrine, are the sheep of the Egyptians, and these, too, are destroyed by the hail. And whatsoever the Egyptians possess is given over to the fire, but Abraham's substance is given to Isaac.

{Prov 6:27; Job 31:1; 1 Cor 9:27; Mt 5:28}
Prov 6:27. That you may not say, "What harm is there in the eyes, when there is no necessity that he should be perverted who looks?" he shows you that desire is a fire, and the flesh is like a garment. The latter is an easy prey, and the former is a tyrant. And when anything harmful is not only taken within, but also held fast, it will not go forth again until it has made an exit for itself. For he who looks upon a woman, even though he escape the temptation, does not come away pure of all lust. And why should one have trouble, if he can be chaste and free of trouble? See what Job says: "I made a covenant with my eyes, that I should not think of another's wife." Thus well does he know the power of abuse. And Paul for this reason kept "under his body, and brought it into subjection." And, figuratively speaking, he keeps a fire in his breast who permits an impure thought to dwell in his heart. And he walks upon coals who, by sinning in act, destroys his own soul.

As likewise the wise prophet testifies: Wisdom that was before the world, and is the source of life, the infinite "Wisdom of God, has built her house" by a mother who knew no man,-- to wit, as He assumed the temple of the body.

For as the body is one, and yet has many members; so also sin, being one, contains within it many various lusts by which it lays its snares for men. Wherefore, in order to teach us this, he uses the examples of Hades, and the love of women, and Tartarus, and the earth that is not filled with water. And water and fire, indeed, will never say, "It is enough." And Hades in no wise ceases to receive the souls of unrighteous men; nor does the love of sin, in the instance of the love of women, cease to be given to fornication, and it becomes the betrayer of the soul. And as Tartarus, which is situated in a doleful and dark locality, is not touched by a ray of light, so is everyone who is the slave of sin in all the passions of the flesh. Like the earth not filled with water he is never able to come to confession, and to the laver of regeneration, and like water and fire, never says, "It is enough."

ORIGEN NUMBERS****
{Preface to Numbers; Preface to Leviticus; Judith; Tobit; Canon, Old Testament; 2 Tim 3:16}
1. Thus, when they are read some passages from the divine books in which there is nothing apparently obscure, they gladly receive it, for example, the book of Esther or of Judith, or even of Tobit, or the precepts Wisdom. But if they are read the Book of Leviticus, their mind is constantly offended and refuses it as not its own food. For since such a mind comes to learn how to worship God and to accept His commandments of righteousness and true religion, if he hears instead orders given about sacrifices and rites of immolation taught, how could he avoid constantly being inattentive and refusing the food as not suitable for him? Moreover, when the Gospels or the Apostle or the Psalms are read, another person joyfully receives them, gladly embraces them, and rejoices in assembling from them, as it were, remedies for his weakness. But if the book of Numbers is read to him, and especially those passages we have now in hand he will judge that there is nothing helpful, nothing as a remedy for his weakness or a benefit for the salvation of his soul. He will constantly reject and spit them out as heavy and burdensome food. 
. . .
But we cannot say of the Holy Spirit's writings that there is anything useless or unnecessary in them, however much they appear obscure to some. What we ought rather to do is to turn the eyes of our mind toward Him who ordered this to be written and to ask of Him their
meaning.
Origen, Homily 27 on Numbers, par.1.

{Preface to Numbers; 1 Cor 10:11}
2. Who would dare to say that what is written "by the Word of God is of no us and makes no contribution to salvation, but is merely a narrative of what happened and was over and done a long time ago, but pertains in no way to us when it is told? These opinions are irreligious and foreign to the catholic faith.

2. (con't) In a spiritual sense, there can be seen a double exodus from Egypt, either when we leave our life as Gentiles and come to the knowledge of the divine law or when the soul leaves its dwelling place in the body.

{Num 33:1; Typology}
*KJV Num 33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
short definition: hand

6. For the hand of Moses and Aaron is mentioned so that you may understand "hand" to mean work. If when I leave Egypt and turn to God I cast away pride, then I have sacrificed a bull to God by the hand of Aaron. If I have destroyed wantonness and lust, I believe I have killed a goat for the Lord by the hand of Aaron. If I have conquered desire, a calf; if folly, I will seem to have sacrificed a sheep. In this way when the vices of the soul are purged, the hand of Aaron works in us. And the hand of Moses is with us when we are enlightened by the Law to understand these very things.
Origen, Homily 27 on Numbers, par.6.

{Num 33:2; Heb 3:17; 1 Cor 10:5; Mt 7:13-14}
7. "And Moses wrote down their starting places and their stages by the Word of the Lord" (Num. 33:2). He wrote them down, then, "by the Word of the Lord" so that when we read them and see how many starting places lie ahead of us on the journey that leads to the kingdom, we may prepare ourselves for this way of life and, considering the journey that lies ahead of us, may not allow the time of our life to be ruined by sloth and neglect. The danger is that while we linger in the vanities of the world and delight in each of the sensations that come to our sight or hearing or even to touch, smell, and taste, days may slip by, time may pass on, and we shall not find an opportunity for completing the journey that lies ahead. Then we give up halfway there, and there will happen to us what is reported of those who could not complete the journey, but whose limb fell in the wilderness (Heb. 3:17; 1 Cor. 10:5). Thus, we are on a journey.

ORIGEN LUKE****

Luke 1.6  On the passage, "But both were just in God's sight and walked without blame in all the Lords commandments and precepts."  
1. PEOPLE WHO WANT to offer an excuse for their sins claim that no one is without sin. They appeal to the testi¬mony of the Book of Job, where Scripture says. "No one is clean from filth, not even if his life upon the earth has been only one day long. His months can be numbered.'" But they only mouth the words of this verse and are wholly igno¬rant of its meaning. We shall answer them briefly. "To be with¬out sin" has two meanings in Scripture. One is never to have sinned at all; the other is to have ceased sinning. If they say that the phrase "to be without sin" describes someone who has never sinned at all, then we agree that no one is without sin. All of us have sinned at some time, even though we might have become virtuous afterwards. But if they take the phrase "no one is without sin" as denying that anyone, after he has sinned, can return to the practice of virtues and never sin again, then their opinion is wrong. For, it can happen that someone who has previously sinned can stop sinning and be said to be "without sin."

Our Lord Jesus Christ "presented to himself a glorious Church, which had no stain "' (Eph 5.2)--not because the members of the Church never had a stain, but because they were later free from stain. Scripture adds, "and no wrinkle," not because the members of the Church did not have the wrinkles "of the old man" at one time, hut because they have ceased to have them. The words that follow should be understood in the same way: "So that the Church may be holy and spotless"'--not because their souls were spotless from the beginning, but because they are coun¬ted as pure and unblemished after they have ceased being stained. We say this to teach that someone who has stopped sinning can be called "without sin and spotless." Hence, Scrip¬ture says clearly of Zechariah and Elizabeth, "Both were just in God's sight and walked without blame in all the Lord's commandments and precepts.'"  
Origen, Homily 2 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 1:6; Jn 12:43}
Let us consider more deeply the praises of Zechariah and Elizabeth that Luke writes in his narrative. We want not only to understand that they deserved praise, but also to make their holy zeal our own and become worthy of praise ourselves. Luke could have written simply, "Both were just and walked in all the commandments." But he had to add, "Both were just in God's sight.' For, it can happen that someone is just in the sight of men without being just "in God's sight." For example, someone has nothing evil to say about me. He considers everything about me and finds nothing to reproach me with. Then I am just in the sight of men. Imagine that everyone has the same opinion of me. They seek something to reproach me with but cannot find anything. They praise me unanimously. Then I am just in the sight of many. But the judgment of men is uncertain. They do not know whether I once sinned in the hidden depths of my heart--whether I looked at a woman and desired her, and adultery was born in my heart." When men see me giving alms according to my means, they do not know whether I am doing it because of God's commandment or because I am seeking human praise and applause. To be just "in God's sight" is a difficult undertaking. It means that you do something good only for the sake of the good and you seek only God, who rewards a good work. The Apostle says something like that: "Their praise is not from men but from God." Blessed is he who is just and praisewor¬thy "in God's sight." For, although men seem to have clear judgment, they cannot judge inerrantly. It happens from time to time that they praise someone who is not praiseworthy and reproach someone who deserves no reproach at all. Both in praise and in censure God alone is a just judge.  
Origen, Homily 2 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 1:6; Prov 3:4}
5. Thus Luke rightly adds to the praise of those two just people, "Both were just in God's sight." Solomon, too, in the Book of Proverbs, urges us on to a goal like this when he says, "Look for good in the sight of God and men."  There follows more praise of Zechariah and Elizabeth: "They walked in all the Lord's commandments and pre¬cepts." We walk "in the Lord's precepts" when we judge well and rightly. We walk "in his commandments" when we do some deed well and rightly. I think Luke wanted to com¬mend them with perfect praise when he said, "Both were just and walked in all the Lord's commandments and precepts.""  
Origen, Homily 2 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 1:6; 2 Cor 5:10}
Someone might say to me, "If this praise is perfect, what does Scripture mean when it adds, 'without blame'? It was enough to say, 'they walked in all the Lord's ways and pre-cepts,''' unless it can happen that someone might walk in all God's commandments and still not walk 'without blame.' . . .  We can fulfill God's commands but have our consciences spattered with the filth of vainglory because we are pleasing men. We might be motivated to do good deeds by a reason that displeases God. In these cases we can be carrying out God's commandment, but we are not doing it "without blame," and are following unjustly what is just. Thus it is difficult to "walk without blame in all the Lord's commandments and precepts," following the testimony and praise of God in Christ Jesus. This praise has to be given on the day of judgment by him "before whose tribunal all of us must stand, so that each one might receive recompense for what he has done in his body, whether good or evi1." "For, we shall all stand before God's tribunal" to receive what we merit in Christ Jesus to whom is glory and power for ages of ages. 
Origen, Homily 2 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 1:17; Lk 1:35; Descent into Hades}
"He will go before Christ in the spirit and power of Elijah." Luke does not say. "in the soul of Elijah," but, "in the spirit and power of Elijah." Power and spirit dwelt in Elijah as in all the prophets and, with regard to his humanity, in the Lord and Savior as well. A little later in the Gospel the angel says to Mary, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you."' So the spirit that had been in Elijah came upon John as well, and the power that Elijah had also appeared in John. Elijah was carried off to heaven. John was the Lord's precur¬sor and died before him so that he could go down to the un¬derworld and proclaim His coming.
Origen, Homily 3 on Luke.

{Mt 11:29; Lk 1:48}
5. For the Savior says, "learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." If you wish to hear the name of this virtue, how even the philosophers designated it, listen: the humility that God looks upon is the same virtue that they call modesty or moderation.. . . It is the state of someone who is not conceited, but who lowers himself.
[Footnote:]  The Greeks never considered humility to be a virtue, and the word used for it at Luke 1:48 always had in secular Greek negative connotations. Morally, it meant "baseness" or "vileness." Socially, it meant "lowness of position."
Origen, Homily 8 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 1:13}
4. then they sought good reasons why in particular he should be called John. No one in his family had this name. They asked his father. Zachariah was unable to answer, and spoke by writing letters and gesturing he wrote on a tablet, "his name is John." As soon as the stylus marked the wax, his tongue, which of been down, was loosed. 
Origen, Homily 9 on Luke, par. 4.

{Lk 1:71; Jn 8:56}
3."Deliverance from our enemies." We should not think this means corporeal enemies, the wrath or spiritual ones for the Lord Jesus came, "strong in battle," to destroy our enemies and free us from their snares, namely from the hand of all our enemies. " "To bring about mercy for our fathers." I believe that, when our Lord the savior came, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were blessed with God's mercy. Previously, they had seen his day and rejoiced. It is not believable that they did not profit from it later, when he came and was born of a virgin.
Origen, Homily 10 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 1:41; Lk 1:67; Lk 7:28; John the Baptist}
6. John heard Jesus while he was still enclosed in his mother's womb, and leapt up and rejoiced when he heard him. Why might you not believe that, once he was born, he could understand his father's prophecy, as Zechariah said to him, "And you, child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways." So I suppose that Zechariah hastened to speak to the infant because he knew John would soon be living in the desert, and he would no longer enjoy John's presence. "For, the boy was in the wilderness up to the day of his revelation to Israel."' (Lk 1:80) …
7. Moses, too, dwelt in the desert [like John the Baptist]. After he completed the fortieth year of his age, he fled from Egypt and, for another forty years, pastured Jethro's herds. But John went out to the wilderness as soon as he was born. "Greatest among the sons of women," he was evidently worthy of a greater upbringing. The prophet says of him, "Behold I send my angel before your face." One who had been sent into the Lord's presence, and who, as soon as he was born could hear and understand his father's prophecies, is rightly called an angel [or messenger]. We believe such great miracles.
Origen, Homily 10 on Luke, par. 6 and 7.

{Lk 1:80; Tripartite Nature of Man}
"But the boy grew and was strengthened in spirit."
1. What it means follows: "He grew in spirit." His spirit did not remain in the same condition in which it had begun, but always kept growing in him. In each hour and each moment, as the spirit grew, his soul too kept developing. And not only his soul, but also his senses and his mind kept following the growth of his spirit.
Origen, Homily 11 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 1:80; Mt 26:41; Tripartite Nature of Man}
3. 'For the spirit is quick to respond, but the flesh is weak.' (Mt 26:41) Someone who wants to become stronger should be strengthened only in spirit. Many are strengthened in the flesh, and their bodies become more powerful. But an ath¬lete of God should become more powerful in spirit. Thus strengthened, he will crush the wisdom of the flesh. Spiritual activity will subject the body to the soul's command.
Origen, Homily 11 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 1:80; Lk 1:41; Lk 1:76; Ex 19:19; John the Baptist}
4."And he was in the wilderness until the day of his revela¬tion to Israel." I said recently that even John's conception had something astonishing about it. "The infant leapt in the womb." and, [this was] before he was born. He recognized his Lord. His birth was just as much a wonder. Zechariah spoke to him as to one who could hear and prophesied, "And you, child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High." John had been conceived and born thus. So it was right for him not to expect to be reared by his father and mother "until the day of his revelation to Israel." He withdrew, fleeing from the tumult of cities, the crowds of people, and the vices of the towns. He went into the wilderness, where the air is purer and the sky more open, and God is closer. Neither the mystery of his bap¬tism nor the time for preaching had come yet. He gave himself to prayers and associated with angels. He called upon God and heard him answer and say, "Behold I am here."" Just as "Moses spoke and God answered him," so, I think, John spoke in the desert and the Lord answered him. 
Origen, Homily 11 on Luke, par. 4.

{Mt 11:11; Lk 7:28; Lk 1:80; Mt 3:4; John the Baptist}
5. I believe this, because I am impressed by the clear account of the Scriptures. For, if "none among those born of women was greater than John the Baptist,"16 and God answered Moses," then it was fitting that he also answered John. For John was greater than Moses. John was reared in the wilderness. The same archangel announced John's birth as announced the Lord's. John's father, who did not believe John was to be born, fell dumb. Hence, John "was in the desert." He was nourished in a new way, not according to human customs. Matthew mentions this: "But his food was locusts, and honey from the woodland." . . . Hence, he did not have household honey, filtered by human attention. He had woodland honey, and a flying insect that was his food. This insect is not large; it does not fly high. It is a small insect; it scarcely rises from the ground; it leaps rather than flies. Why should I say more? Scripture says quite clearly that his food was locusts--a small and clean animal. 
Origen, Homily 11 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 2:1-2; Rev 20:12}
6. After this Scripture adds, "It happened in those days that an edict went out from Caesar Augustus, that the whole world should be registered. This was the first census made under Cyrinus, the governor of Syria." Someone might say, "Evange¬list, how does this narrative help me? How does it help me to know that the first census of the entire world was made under Caesar Augustus; and that among all these people the name of Joseph, with Mary who was espoused to him and preg¬nant,' was included; and that, before the census was finished?" To one who looks more carefully, a mystery seems to be conveyed. It is significant that Christ should have been recorded in the census of the whole world. He was regis¬tered with everyone, and sanctified everyone. He was joined with the world for the census, and offers the world commu¬nion with himself. After this census, he could enroll those from the whole world "in the book of the living" with himself.  
Origen, Homily 11 on Luke, par. 6.

{Mt 8:23-25}
1. The Gospel records that certain men were ploughing the sea with oars against contrary winds. They were already exhausted. They had toiled for twenty-five or thirty stadia and could not reach port. Afterwards the Lord came to them. He made the swelling waves grow calm and freed the ship, whose hull was being buffeted on both sides, from imminent danger. 
Origen, Homily 13 on Luke, par. 1.

{Heb 1:14; Lk 2:14; Col 1:20}
2. Understand he passage in the following way. The angels wanted to offer men help and  provide them with a cure for their diseases. "All spirits are servants, sent to minister on account of those who are to attain salvation." As much as they could, they helped men. But they realized that their remedy fell far short of what men's cure required. Take it a step further, so that you can understand from an example what we are saying. Picture a city in which very many people are sick and a large hand of doctors is employed. There are various wounds. Every day spreading gangrene infects the moribund flesh. But still, the doctors who are employed to provide a cure are unable to discover any more remedies and thus overcome the great evil by the knowledge of their art. With the situation in such a state, a master physician arrives, one who possesses full knowledge of his art. Those doctors who previously could not heal see the gangrene in the wounds halted by the master's hand. They do not envy him, nor are they wracked with jeal¬ousy. Instead they break forth into praise of the master physi¬cian and thus exalt God, who sent a man of such great knowl¬edge both for themselves and for the sick. … 3. It is for a reason like this that a great number of the army of angels was heard saying, "Glory to God on high, and peace on earth among men of good will." For, after the Lord came to the earth, "he established peace through the blood of his cross, both for those upon the earth and those who are in heaven." And the angels wanted men to remember their Cre¬ator. They had done everything in their power to cure them, but men were unwilling to be cured. Then the angels behold him who could effect a cure. They give glory and say, "Glory to God on high, and peace on earth." 
Origen, Homily 13 on Luke, par. 2+3.

{Lk 2:14; Col 2:14; Mt 10:34; Jn 14:27; Textual Criticism}
4. The careful reader of Scripture might ask how the Savior can say, "I have not come to spread peace upon the earth, but a sword, while now at his birth the angels chant "peace on earth." In another passage, he says in person, "My peace I give to you, peace I leave for you. I do not give peace as this world gives peace." Let the reader consider the argument we ad¬vance; perhaps it can answer his question. If Scripture said, "peace on earth," and the sentence ended there, then the objection would be valid. But something is added. After "peace," that is. Scripture says, "among men of good will." This answers the objection. The peace on earth that the Lord does not give is not the peace "of good will." For he did not say simply "I have not come to spread peace." He added "upon earth." 
Origen, Homily 13 on Luke, par. 4.

{Rev 3:4; Rev 2:15}
5. I shall say that in each of the churches there are two bishops. One is visible, the other invisible. One is visible to the flesh, the other invisible to the senses. A man who carries out well a task committed to him is praised by the Lord. If he does it badly, he is subject to blame and guilty of a fault. The same is true of an angel. In the Apoca¬lypse of John we read. "But you have there a few names that have not sinned." Or again you have this "You have there those who teach the doctrine of the Nicolaitans." And then. "You have those who commit these or those sins." And the angels to whom the churches are entrusted are blamed.
Origen, Homily 13 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 2:16; Isa 1:3; Messianic Prophecies}
7. And they hastened and went, and they found Mary and Joseph and the child." They hastened--not proceeding cautiously, nor at a slow pace--and they went. Thus they found Joseph, who arranged matters for the Lord's birth, and Mary, who bore Jesus in childbirth, and the Savior himself, "lying in a manger."  That was the manger of which the inspired prophet said, "The ox knows his owner and the ass his master's man¬ger." The ox is a clean animal, the ass an unclean animal. "The ass knows his master's manger." The people of Israel did not know their Lords manger, but an unclean animal from among the Gentiles did. Scripture says, "Israel, indeed, did not know me, and my people did not understand me."
FN: Isa 1.3. Origen at this place is the first Christian writer to mention the ox and the ass in the stable at Bethlehem
Origen, Homily 13 on Luke, par. 7.

{Lk 2:21-24; Col 2:9-12; 2 Tim 2:11; baptism}
1. He died so that, once he had died to sins, we who were dead might no longer live to sin and vices. Hence Scripture says, "If we have died with him, we shall also live with him." So, when he died, we died with him, and, when he rose, we rose with him. So too we were circumcised along with him. After the circumcision, we were cleansed in a solemn purification. Hence, we have no need at all for a circumcision of the flesh. You should know that he was circumcised on our account. Listen to Paul's dear procla¬mation. He says. "All the fullness of divinity dwells in him bodily. You are filled in him, who is the head of every rule and power. In him you have been circumcised by a circumcision done without hands, when the body of the flesh was despoiled in the circumcision of Christ. We were buried with him in Baptism, and we have risen up with him through faith in the work of God, who raised him from the dead." (Col 2:9-12) Therefore, his death, his resurrection, and his circumcision took place for our sake.
Origen, Homily 14 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 2:21-24; Job 14:4-5; Zech 3:3; Messianic Prophecies}
3. Then the Gospel says, "When the days of their purifica¬tion were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him into Jerusalem. The passage says, on account of "their" purification. Who are "they"? If Scripture had said, "on ac¬count of her purification"--that is, Mary's, who had given birth--then no question would arise." We would say confi-dently that Mary, who was a human being, needed purification after childbirth. But the passage reads, "the days of their puri¬fication." Apparently it does not signify one, but two or more. Did Jesus therefore need purification? Was he unclean, or polluted with some stain?
. . .Stain and sin do not mean the same thing. . . .
4. Every soul that has been clothed with a human body has its own "stain." (Job 14:4-5) But Jesus was stained through his own will, because he had taken on a human body for our salvation. Listen to the prophet Zechariah. He says, "Jesus was clothed with stained garments." (Zech 3:3; English Bibles say "Jeshua"; but the LXX says Jesus) Zechariah says this to refute those who deny that our Lord had a human body, but say that his body was made of a "heavenly and spiritual substance."
Origen, Homily 14 on Luke, par. 3+4.

{Lk 2:21-24; Lk 1:35; Ps 22:6}
8. At that moment of which Scripture says, "The Spirit of God will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will over¬shadow you," the seed was planted and the conception took place; without an opening of the womb, a new offspring began to grow. Hence the Savior himself says, "But I am a worm, and not a man, reproached by men and rejected by the people." In his mother's womb he saw the uncleanness of bodies. He was walled in on both sides by her innards; he bore the straits of earthly dregs. So he compares himself with a worm and says, "I am a worm and not a man." A man is normally born from a male and female; but I was not born from a male and a female, according to nature and the ways of men. I was born like a worm. A worm does not get seed from outside itself.
Origen, Homily 14 on Luke, par. 8.

{Lk 2:32-35; Jn 9:39}
2. Moreover, Scripture also says of Simeon that he added to Jesus fame and even caused much of the amazement. For, he held the boy in his arms and said, "Now, Lord, you dismiss your servant in peace, according to your word, because my eyes have seen your salvation. Simeon's discourse was the high point and, so to speak, the pinnacle of what was being said about Jesus, and what his mother and father were aston¬ished at. For, it was not enough for him to hold the infant and to speak the words that are recorded as his. He blessed Jesus' father and mother, and also prophesied about the infant him¬self. He said, "Behold, this child has been destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be contradicted. And a sword will pierce your very soul to reveal the thoughts of many hearts." 
What does this passage mean? It says, "Behold, this child has been destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel." I found something similar to this written in the Gospel According to John. It says, "I came into this world for judg¬ment, so that those who are blind might see, and those who see might become blind." (Jn 9:39) He came "for judgment." so that the blind among the Gentiles might see, and those of Israel who had previously had their sight might become blind." Thus too, he came "for the falling and the rising of many." For, at the coming of our Lord and Savior, those who previously had stood fell down, and those who had fallen rose up. This is one interpretation of what has been said "Behold, this child has been destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel." 
Origen, Homily 16 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 2:34; Gal 5:19; Col 3:5; Mt 24:28}
9. I have something within me that wrongly stands upright and rears itself up in the pride of sin. Let this thing fall; let it be destroyed. If it falls, then what had previously fallen will rise up and stand. My "interior man" once lay broken, and the "exterior man" stood straight. Before I believed in Jesus, the good in me lay low, while the evil was standing. After he came, what was evil in me collapsed. And Scripture has been fulfilled "Always carrying about in the body the death of Je¬sus" and, "Put to death your members upon earth: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery," and the rest. 
10. The fall of all these vices is advantageous. Of his fall Scripture says, "Wherever the cadaver is, there will the eagles gather." The word "cadaver" comes from the verb "to fall." This fall is good. First of all, Jesus came because of it. Nor could it bring about a rising unless a falling had come first. Let him first come to destroy what is evil in me. Once that has been destroyed and put to death, let what is good arise in mc and receive life, so that we may obtain the kingdom of heaven in him.
Origen, Homily 16 on Luke, par. 9+10.

{Lk 2:48; Lk 3:23}
1. Luke clearly handed down to us that Jesus was the son of a virgin, and was not conceived by human seed. But Luke has also attested that Joseph was his father when he said, "And his father and mother were astonished by the things that were being said about him." Therefore, what reason was there that Luke should call him a father when he was not a father? Anyone who is content with a simple expla¬nation will say, "The Holy Spirit honored Joseph with the name of father because he had reared Jesus." But one who looks for a more profound explanation can say that the Lord's genealogy extends from David to Joseph. Lest the naming of Joseph, who was not the Savior's father, should appear to be pointless, he is called the Lord's "father," to give him his place in the genealogy.
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 2:34; Rom 6:8; Rom 6:5}
3. But now we have to interpret the meaning of the passage that says, "Behold, this child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel." It is right that I should first fall and then, after I have fallen, rise up aright. Otherwise, the Savior would be the cause of an evil fall for me. But he made me fall for this reason, that I might rise up. My fall was to be very beneficial to me--much more than the time when I seemed to stand. For, at that time when I lived by sin, I was standing by sin. Because I was standing by sin, the first benefit I received was to fall and die to sin. . . . You were a sinner. Let the sinner in you fall. Then you can rise again and say, "If we have died with him, we shall also live with him," and "If we have been made like him in death, we shall also be like him in resurrection."
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 3.

{Marcion; Ebionites; Lk 2:34; Jn 20:25}
5. and "for a sign that is contra¬dicted." Everything that the plain narrative recounts about the Savior is contradicted. The virgin is a mother. This is "a sign that is contradicted." The Marcionites contradict this sign and insist that he was not born of a woman. The Ebionites contradict this sign and say that he was born of a man and a woman in the same way as we are born. He had a human body. This too is "a sign that is contradicted." For, some say that he came down from heaven. Others say that he had a body like ours, so that he could also redeem our bodies from sin by the likeness of his body to ours and give us hope of resurrection. He rose from the dead. This is also "a sign that is contra¬dicted." How did he rise? Was he just as he was when he died, or did he surely rise into a body of a better substance? 
There is endless contention on this point. Some say, "He showed Thomas the mark of the nails in his hands." Others argue from another line of thought "If he had the same body, how did he enter through closed doors and stand there?" So you see how even the question of his resurrection is beset with various arguments and is "a sign that is contradicted."
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 2:35; Mt 26:31; Rom 3:23; Mary}
6. Thereupon Simeon says, "a sword will pierce your very soul." Which sword is this that pierced not only others' hearts, but even Mary's? Scripture clearly records that, at the time of the Passion, all the apostles were stumbled. The Lord himself said, "This night you will all be stumbled." Thus, they were all so stumbled that Peter too, the leader of the apostles, denied him three times. Why do we think that the mother of the Lord was immune from scandal when the apost1es were stumbled? If she did not suffer scandal at the Lord's Passion, then Jesus did not die for her sins. But if "all have sinned and lack Gods glory, but are justified by his grace and redeemed," then Mary too was stumbled at that time. 
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 6.

{Lk 2:35; Lk 1:35; Mt 26:39; Mary}
And this is what Simeon now prophesies when he says, ". . . and your very soul." You know, Mary, that you bore as a virgin, without a man. You heard from Gabriel, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will over¬shadow you." The "sword" of unbelief "will pierce" you and you will be struck by the blade of uncertainty and your thoughts will tear you in pieces when you see him. You had heard him called the Son of God. You knew he was begotten without a man's seed. You knew he was crucified, and died, and subjected to human punishment. You knew that at the end he lamented and said, "Father, if it is possible, let this chalice pass from me." Thus the Scripture: "and a sword will pierce your very soul."
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 6.

{Lk 2:35; Ps 32:5; Isa 44:22; Jas 5:16}
8."To reveal the thoughts in the hearts of many." Men had evil thoughts. They were revealed to bring them into the open and destroy them. Once they had been slain and are dead, they would cease to exist. He who died for us would kill them. For, as long as such thoughts were hidden and not brought out into the open, it was quite impossible to kill them. Thus, if we ourselves have sinned, we ought to say, "I made my sin known to you, and I have not hidden my iniquity." I said, "Against myself shall I proclaim my injustice to the Lord." For if we have done this and revealed our sins not only to God but also to those who can heal our wounds and our sins, our sins will be blotted out by him who says, "I shall blot out your transgressions like a cloud and like a mist your sins." (Isa. 44:22) 
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 8.

{Lk 2:36-38; Widows; 1 Cor 11:3}
9. Because it was necessary that women too should be saved, after Simeon there came a woman who was a prophetess. Of her Scripture says, "And Anna was a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, from the tribe of Asher." How beautiful the order is. The woman did not come before the man. First came Si¬meon, who took the child and held him in his arms. Then came the woman. Her exact words are not recorded. But the account says in general terms that "she gave praise to the Lord and spoke about him to everyone who was awaiting the re¬demption of Jerusalem." The holy woman justly deserved to receive the spirit of prophecy, because by a long life of chastity and long fasts she had risen to this high state. 
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 9.

{Lk 2:36-38; Col 1:15; Col 1:18; 1 Tim 3:2; 1 Tim 3:12; 1 Tim 5:5; 1 Tim 5:9; Titus 1:6; 1 Cor 7:8-9}
10. Women, look on Anna's testimony and imitate it. If it ever happens to you that you lose your husbands, ponder what Scripture has said of Anna. "For seven years from her virginity she lived with her husband," and so on. For that reason she was a prophetess. The Holy Spirit did not dwell in her acciden¬tally or by chance. . . . But now second, third, and fourth marriages--and I keep my silence about even more--are found in the Church. We know that such a union will eject us from the kingdom of God. Not only fornication, but also a second marriage, excludes someone from office in the Church. Anyone twice married may be nei¬ther a bishop nor a presbyter nor a deacon nor a widow." Perhaps in this sense will a twice-married man be ejected from the assembly "of the first-born and the spotless," "the Church, which has neither spot nor wrinkle"--not to be cast into eternal fire, but to be denied a place in the kingdom of God. 
[Note: He is talking about marriage after the death of someone's spouse, not second marriages after divorce.]
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 10.

{1 Cor 1:2}
11. I recall that, when I was explaining what is written to the Corinthians, namely, "To the Church of God which is at Corinth, together with all who invoke" him. I said that there was a difference between "the Church" and "those who invoke the name of the Lord." For I think that the man who married only once, and the virgin, and he who perseveres in abstinence, belong to the Church of God. He who marries twice, even if he has good morals and is outstanding in the other virtues, is not "of the Church" or of that number who "have neither wrinkle nor spot," or anything else of that sort. He is rather of the second rank, and among those who invoke the name of the Lord. They are saved in the name of Jesus Christ, but they are not crowned by him. 
Origen, Homily 17 on Luke, par. 11.

{Lk 2:46}
3. My Jesus cannot be found in the crowd of the many. Learn where they who seek him find him. Then you too, when you seek him along with Joseph and Mary, might be able to find him. They sought him and Scripture says. "they found him in the temple" not in any other place but "in the tem¬ple"; and not simply "in the temple," but "in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions." You too therefore seek Jesus "in the temple" of God. Seek him in the Church. Seek him among the teachers who are "in the temple" and do not leave it. For, if you seek him in this way, you will find him. But, if anyone says he is a teacher and does not possess Jesus, he is a teacher only in name and Jesus, who is God's Word and Wisdom, cannot be found with him. … They find him "sit-ting in the midst of the teachers"--and not only sitting, but "asking them questions and listening to them." Jesus is present now as well. He questions us and hears us speaking. Scrip¬ture says, "And all were astonished.  What were they aston¬ished about? Not about his questions, even though they too were remarkable, but "about his answers." For it is one thing to ask questions, another to answer them. 
Origen, Homily 18 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 2:46; Ex 19:19; Greek-answer (apokrisesin)}
4. He was questioning the teachers and, since from time to time they could not answer, he himself would answer the question he had asked. Let the divine law itself teach you that in the Holy Scriptures the word "answer" [apokrisesin] does not mean the give and take of ordinary conversation, but the teaching found in the Scriptures." Moses was speaking, and God was answer¬ing him with his voice." (Ex. 19:19 LXX) That answer concerned matters that Moses was ignorant of, and in which the Lord instructed him. Sometimes Jesus asks questions, sometimes he answers. As we said earlier, as astonishing as his questions are, his answers are still more astonishing. Let us implore him and beg him with great earnestness and sorrow to allow us to hear him, and to ask us questions that he himself would solve. Then we shall be able to find him whom we seek.
Origen, Homily 18 on Luke, par. 4.

{Lk 2:51; Eph 6:1-2; Heb 13:17}
5. Here too Scripture says, "He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them." Children, we should learn to be subject to our parents. The greater is subject to the lesser. Jesus understood that Jo¬seph was greater than he in age, and therefore he gave him the honor due a parent. He gave an example to every son. Sons should be subject to their fathers; and, if they have no fathers, they should be subject to those who serve as fathers. But why am I speaking about parents and children? If Jesus, the Son of God, is subject to Joseph and Mary, shall I not be subject to the bishop? God appointed him a father to me. Shall I not be subject to the presbyter, whom the Lords choice set over me? I think Joseph understood that Jesus, who was subject to him, was greater than he. He knew that the one subject to him was greater than he and, out of reverence, re¬strained his authority. So each one should realize that often a lesser man is put in charge of better men. Sometimes it hap¬pens that he who is subject is better than he who appears to be in authority. Once someone who enjoys a higher position understands this, he will not be lifted up in pride by the fact that he is greater. He will know that a better one is subject to himself, just as Jesus was subject to Joseph. 
Origen, Homily 18 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 3:1}
2. But, since many from Judea and Galilee were destined to believe, these kingdoms too were put in the heading. The passage reads, "Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of Iturea. . ."
Origen, Homily 21 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 3:3; Lk 3:8; Acts 2:38; Baptism}
4. Jordan" means "descending." But the "descend¬ing" river of God, one running with a vigorous force is the Lord our Savior. Into him we are baptized with true water, saving water. Baptism is also preached "for the remission of sins." Come, catechumens. Do penance [repent], so that Baptism for the remission of sins will follow. He who stops sinning receives Baptism "for the remission of sins." For, if anyone comes sinning to the washing, he does not receive forgiveness of sins. Therefore, I implore you, do not come to Baptism without caution and careful consideration. First show "results worthy of repentance." Spend some time in good living. Keep your¬selves clean of all stains and vices. Your sins will be forgiven when you yourselves begin to despise your own sins. Put aside your own offenses and they will be forgiven you. 
Origen, Homily 21 on Luke, par. 4.

{Lk 3:4}
5. For this Scrip¬ture says, "The voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare the way for the Lord. Make his paths straight." The Lord wants to find in you a path by which he can enter into your souls and make his journey. Prepare for him the path of which it is said, "Make straight his paths."
Origen, Homily 21 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 3:5-8}
1. What follows applies properly to the Lord and Savior. For "every valley has been filled" not by John, but by the Lord and Savior. Each one should reflect on himself, about who he was before he believed. Then he should observe that he has been a lowly valley, a steep valley, one that dropped down into the depths. But when the Lord Jesus came, and sent the Holy Spirit as his deputy, "every valley was filled." They were filled with good works and the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Love does not allow a valley to remain in you. If you possess peace and patience and goodness, not only will you cease to be a valley, but you will even begin to be God's mountain. 
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 3:5; Isa 40:3-5}
2.  "Every valley will be filled." We see this done and fulfilled daily, both among the Gentiles and in the people of Israel, who have been cast down from on high. "Every mountain and hill will be made low." Once that people was a mountain and a hill; now they are cast down and demolished. Because of their sin, salvation has been given to the Gentiles, and they are to be jealous of the Gentiles. But you will not err, either, if you say that opposing powers, which were raised up against mortals, are the mountains and hills that were cast down. For to fill in this sort of valley, the opposing powers--the moun¬tains and hills--must be made low. 
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 3:5-8; Gal 2:20}
3. We also need to consider whether the next phrase, which was prophesied at Christ's coming, has been fulfilled. The passage reads, "And all that is crooked will be made straight." Each of us was crooked. Or, if he was crooked once, but has not remained so up to the present day, this happened through the coming of Christ. His coming touched our souls; whatever was crooked is now straight. For, what profit is it to you, if Christ once came in the flesh, unless he also comes into your soul? We should pray that he will come to us each day so that we can say, "I live, now not I, but Christ lives in me."
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 3:5; Jn 14:23}
4. Let us also consider the other points that are proclaimed in Christs coming. Nothing was rougher than you. Consider your former actions. Look at your anger and the rest of your vices. If they have ceased to be what they were, you will realize that nothing was rougher than you, and--if I can say some¬thing even clearer--nothing was more uneven. Your morals and your speech were uneven, and your deeds were uneven. So my Lord Jesus came and leveled out your rough places and turned whatever was in disarray into level roads. Then there is a path in you with nothing to stumble on, level and very dear. God the Father can walk in you. Christ the Lord can make his dwelling in you and say, "My Father and I shall come and make our dwelling with him." 
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 4.

{Lk 3:7; Gen 12:1; Baptism; Acts 2:38}
5. But you should pay attention to what John says "to the people going out" to baptism. If anyone wants to be baptized, let him "go out." One who remains in his original state and does not leave behind his habits and his customs does not come to baptism properly. To understand what it is to "go out" to bap¬tism, accept the testimony and listen to the words by which God speaks to Abraham "Go out of your land," and so forth. 
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 3:7-8; Gal 5:22-23; Baptism}
8. Then there follows, "Who showed you how to flee from the wrath to come? Produce fruits worthy of repentance." To you, who are coming to Baptism, Scripture says, "Produce fruits worthy of repentance." Do you want to know which fruits are worthy of repentance? "Charity is a fruit of the spirit; joy is a fruit of the spirit; so are peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, continence," and the others of this sort. If we have all of these virtues, we have produced "fruits worthy of repentance." 
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 8.

{Lk 3:8; Jn 8:39; Mt 11:13}
8. (con't) Again it is said to those who were coming to Johns baptism, "And do not begin to say among yourselves, "We have Abraham for a father. For, I say to you, God can raise up sons for Abraham from these stones." John, the last of the prophets, prophesies the expulsion of the first nation [Israel] and the call of the Gentiles. To those who were boasting about Abraham he says, "And do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham for a father." And again he speaks about the Gentiles, "For I say to you, that God can raise up sons for Abraham from these stones." 
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 8.

{Lk 3:8; Ps 115:8}
9. From which stones? Surely he was not pointing to irratio¬nal, material stones, but to men who were uncomprehending and sometimes hard. They adored stones or wood. In them is fulfilled what the psalm sings about such men "May they who make these idols, and all who trust in them, become like their idols." Those who make idols and trust in them are like their gods they are turned into stones and wood, without sensation, without any reason.
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 9.

{Lk 3:8; Ex 15:16; Jews, Unbelieving; Mt 21:43}
10. This is our explanation of what John said "God can raise up sons for Abraham from these stones. Therefore, we too should pray to God that we also might be made into "sons for Abraham," if once we were stones. May this happen in place of those sons who have been rejected, and who have lost the promise and their adoption by their own sin. I shall cite one more testimony about stones, since in the canticle of Exodus Scripture says, "Let them be turned into stones until your people, Lord, passes through, until that people of yours, which you possessed, passes through." (Ex 15:16) So God is asked that for a short while the Gentiles might be "changed into stones"--that is what the Greek word apolithothetosan really means--until the Jewish people passes through. There is no doubt but that, after they have passed through, the Gentiles will cease to be stone, and will receive in place of their hard hearts a human and rational nature in Christ, to whom is glory and power for ages of ages.
Origen, Homily 22 on Luke, par. 10.

{Lk 3:9; Lk 3:7-8; Jews, Unbelieving; Mt 21:43}
1. AT THAT TIME John was already saying, "Behold, the ax has been laid to the root of the trees. And, if indeed the consummation were imminent and the end of the ages were at hand, I would have no questions. The Gospel says, "Behold, the ax has been laid to the root of the trees," and, "Hence every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire." I would say that these prophecies were uttered because they were being fulfilled at that time. But, since long ages passed afterwards, and countless years have gone by from that time until the present day, we should ask how the Holy Spirit could say through the prophet, "Be¬hold, the ax has been laid to the root of the trees." I think the prophecy applies to the people of Israel. That people was soon to be cut away. For, "to those who were going out" to him "to be baptized," John said, among other things, "bear fruits worthy of repentance." And to the Jews he kept saying, "Do not begin to say among yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For, I say to you, God can raise up sons of Abraham from these stones." So, when he says, "Behold, the ax has been laid to the root of the trees," he is speaking to the Jews. 
Origen, Homily 23 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 3:9; Rom 11:17}
2. The apostolic word also fits this sense. The author says that the branches of infidelity have been broken off and cut down by this ax. The goal was to cut off from the tree, not the root, but those shoots that had sprung up from the root. Thus, branches from the wild olive can be grafted onto the root of the original tree. "Therefore, every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire." This is its end, to be burned in the fire.
Origen, Homily 23 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 3:11}
4. We are commanded to give a garment "to one who has none." "Who is the man who does not have even one covering on his flesh, who is naked, who is covered with no garment at all? I do not mean by this that generosity, and pity towards the poor, and even extravagant clemency, are not commanded us, so that we should clothe the naked with our own spare tunic. I say this rather because this passage can be understood more profoundly. We should give a tunic to him who has none at all." Who is the man who does not have a tunic? It is he who utterly lacks God. Therefore, we should divest ourselves and give to him who is naked.
Origen, Homily 23 on Luke, par. 4.

{Rev 2:1; Rev 2:12; Mt 18:10; 1 Cor 11:10; Jn 1:51; 2 Kings 6:15-17}
7. It has been written in the Apocalypse of John, "Write to the angel of the church of the Ephesians, I have something against you."." And again, "Write to the angel of the church of Pergamum, 1 have something against you." Clearly it is a man who writes to angels and enjoins something. 
8. I do not doubt that angels are even present in our assem¬bly--not only generally, to every church, but even singly. The Savior says of them, "Their angels always see the face of my Father, who is in heaven." Here a double church is present, one of men, the other of angels. If we say anything in accord with reason and according to the intent of the Scriptures, the angels rejoice and pray with us. And angels are present in the church--at least in that church that deserves them and belongs to Christ. This is the reason why women are com¬manded to have "a veil on their heads" when they pray, "because of the angels." Which angels? Clearly those who aid the holy ones and rejoice in the church. Our eyes are closed by the stains of sins, and we do not see them. But the apostles of Jesus see them. He says to them, "Amen, amen, 1say to you, you will see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascend¬ing and descending upon the Son of Man." 
9. If I had this grace, to see just as the apostles saw, and to behold as Paul beheld, I would now see a multitude of angels. Elisha saw them. Gehazi, who stood with him, did not see them. Gehazi was fearful, lest he be captured by enemies. He saw only Elisha. But Elisha, as a prophet of the Lord, prays and says, "Oh Lord, open the eyes of this servant, and let him see that many more are with us than with them." And, at the prayers of the holy man, Gehazi immediately perceived the angels which he had not seen before.
Origen, Homily 23 on Luke, par. 7-9.

{Lk 3:15; John the Baptist}
1. If someone loves another, he should consider the nature and the causes of his loving, and not love that person more than he deserves. . . . Take John as an example. The people revered and loved him. And indeed he was a worthy object of wonder. More deference was paid to him than to the rest of men, for he had lived differently than all other mortals. None of us is content with simple food; we take pleasure in a variety of food. One kind of wine to drink does not suffice for us; we purchase wines with different tastes. … 2. But John always ate locusts, and he always ate woodland honey. He was content with simple and light food, lest his body grow fat on richer, savory dishes and be overpowered by exqui¬site banquets. . . . John's life was remarkable, and quite different than other men's way of living. He had no purse, no servant, not even an ordinary hut. He dwelt in the desert, not only until "the day of his mani¬festation to Israel," but also all the time when he was preaching repentance to the people. He dwelt in the desert of Judea. He drank plain water. . . . Notice what sort of garment he was clothed with he had made a tunic "of camels hair," and was girded with "a leather belt." So everything about him was novel. Because his life was so different, everyone who saw him admired him, . . . but they did not keep their love within bounds; for they kept wondering "whether perhaps he was the Christ." 
Origen, Homily 25 on Luke, par. 1-2.

{Marcion; Lk 3:15; 2 Cor 12:6-7; Mk 10:40}
2. (cont) The apostle Paul warns against inordinate and irrational love when he says of himself, "I fear that someone might have an opinion of me above what he sees or hears from me, and that the greatness of the revela¬tions might exalt me," (2 Cor. 12:6,7 paraphrased) and so on. Paul feared that even he might fall into this error. So he was unwilling to state everything about himself that he knew. He wanted no one to think more of him than he saw or going beyond the limits. . . . Fi¬nally, some people burst forth into such great audacity of love that they invented new and unheard of exaggerations about Paul. For, some [Marcionites] say this, that the passage in Scripture that speaks of "sitting at the Saviors right and left" applies to Paul and Marcion.
Origen, Homily 25 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 3:15; Mt 22:37; Rom 8:38-39}
8. Listen for a moment "Love the Lord your God" in Christ, and do not think you can have a different love of the Father than of the Son. Love God and Christ at the same time. Love the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Father, with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength." If anyone inquires and says, "Prove what you are as¬serting from the Scriptures," let him hear the apostle Paul. Paul had a rational love. He said, "I am certain that neither death nor life, neither angels nor powers, neither the present nor the future, neither power nor height nor depth nor any crea¬ture, will be able to separate us from the love for God, which is in Christ Jesus, our Lord and our Savior," to whom is glory and power for ages of ages. (Rom 8:38-39)
Origen, Homily 25 on Luke, par. 8.

{Lk 3:6-17; Jn 4:24; Heb 12:29; Lk 12:49; Deut 4:24; Ps 104:4; 2 Cor 3:16-17}
1. GOD IS SPIRIT, and those who worship him should worship in spirit and in truth." Our God is also "a consuming fire." Therefore, God is called by two names "spirit" and "fire." To the just he is spirit; to sinners he is fire. But the angels are also called "spirit" and "fire." Scripture says, "He makes his angels spirits and his servants a burning fire." To those who are saints, the angels are spirits; but to those who deserve punishment, they administer fire and burning. In this sense, our Lord and Savior, because he is spirit, also "came to cast fire upon the earth." He is "spirit" according to the pas¬sages where Scripture says, "But when you have been converted to the Lord, the veil will be taken away," and, "The Lord is spirit."  (Jn 4:24; Deut 4:24; Ps 104:4; Lk 12:49; 2 Cor 3:16-17)
Origen, Homily 26 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 12:49}
2. But "he came to cast fire" not upon the heavens, but "upon the earth." (Lk 12:49) He himself shows that when he says, "I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already burn¬ing." For, if "you are converted to the Lord," who is spirit, Christ will be spirit for you, and has not "come to cast fire upon the earth." But, if you are not converted to him but cling to the earth and its fruits, "he comes to cast fire" upon the earth.
Origen, Homily 26 on Luke, par. 2.

{Mt 3:11; Lk 3:16-17}
3. Why do I mention this? Because the baptism with which Jesus baptizes is "in the Holy Spirit and fire." . . . If you are holy, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. If you are a sinner, you will be plunged into fire. One and the same baptism will be turned into condemnation and fire for the unworthy and for sinners; but to those who are holy and have been turned to the Lord in total faith, the gift of the Holy Spirit, and salva¬tion, will be given. Therefore, he who is said to baptize "in the Holy Spirit and fire" has "a winnowing fan in his hand, and he will cleanse his threshing floor. And he will gather his wheat into a barn, but the chaff he will burn in unquenchable fire." I want to find the reason why our Lord has a winnowing fan, and what wind is blowing as the light husks are carried off this way or that, while the heavy grains of wheat are borne down into one place. For, wheat and chaff cannot be separated with¬out wind. 
Origen, Homily 26 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 3:17; Job 40:8; Deut 8:2-3; Deut 8:5}
4. I think that wind means temptations. Temptations show that, in the mixed heap of believers, some are husks and others are grains of wheat. For, when your soul is overcome by some temptation, the temptation does not turn you into chaff. Rather, since you are chaff--that is, light in weight and unbelieving--the temptation demonstrates that you are what you were concealing. But, in the opposite case, when you bear trials courageously, temptation does not make you faithful and pa¬tient; it rather brings in to the open the virtues of patience and courage that were in you but hidden. The Lord says, "Do you think that I spoke to you for any other reason than that you might appear just?" (Job 40:8 LXX) And in another place. "I afflicted you and visited you with penury, so that what was in your heart might be made manifest." (Deut 8:2-3; 8:5)
Origen, Homily 26 on Luke, par. 4.

{Mt 7:24-27; Eph 2:20; 1 Pet 2:4}
5. In this way too, a storm does not let a house built on sand remain standing; if you wish to build, build on rock. When the storm has arisen, it will not destroy what is built on rock; but what is built on sand trembles and proves that it had no good foundation there. Hence, before a storm arises, before the gusts of wind blow, before the rivers swell, while all things are still quiet, we should give all our attention to the foundations of our house. We should build our house out of the various solid stones of Gods commandments. When persecution rages and a fear¬some storm arises against Christians," we should show that we have built on the rock, Christ Jesus. But, if anyone denies Christ--may this not happen to us--he should realize that he did not deny Christ at the time he seemed to do so. Rather, the seeds and the roots of his denial were already old. But then, what was in him came to light and was brought into the open. Hence, we should pray to the Lord that we might be a sound building, one that no storm can overturn, "founded on the rock," our Lord Jesus Christ.
Origen, Homily 26 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 3:19}
3. Herod had committed an unjust act and, against the Law of Moses, taken his brother's wife. She had a daughter from her previous husband. John did not fear Herod nor respect his person. He did not think, as I said of his royal power. He did not fear death. For, he knew, even if he were not a prophet, that if Herod were provoked he could kill him. He knew all of this. But with prophetic freedom he rebuked Herod and con¬demned his incestuous marriage.
Origen, Homily 27 on Luke, par. 3.

{Mt 11:3; Lk 7:19}
3. (con't) When John was in chains, he was thinking about Christ, whom he had proclaimed. He himself could not go to Christ, so he sent his disciples to ask a question "Are you he who is to come, or do we wait for another?" … 4. Notice that even while in prison he is teaching. . . . In the course of these words, a question about Jesus arose. John sends some of his disciples and asks, "Are you he who is to come or do we wait for another?" The disciples return and announce to the teacher what the Savior had bidden them to say. With Jesus words, John was armed for battle. He died confidently, and was beheaded with¬out resistance, strengthened by the words of the Lord himself and believing that he in whom he believed was truly the Son of God.
Origen, Homily 27 on Luke, par. 3-4.

{Lk 3:22; Jn 20:23}
5. After the Lord "ascended on high, leading captivity captive," he gave us the Spirit. The Spirit had come to him, and he gave the Spirit at the time of his Resurrection when he said, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone's sins, they will be for¬given him. If you retain them for anyone, they will be re¬tained." But "the Holy Spirit came down upon" the Savior "in the form of a dove." The dove is a gentle bird, innocent and simple. Hence, we too are commanded to imitate the innocence of doves.
Origen, Homily 27 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 3:23; Mt 1:15-16; Jesus, Genealogy of}
1. But the evangelists do not give the same account of his genealogy. This fact has disquieted some people very much. … 2. Nor are the same persons mentioned in his genealogy when his descent and his ascent are traced." Matthew, who makes him descend from the heavenly regions, mentions women--not any women at all, but sinners, and those whom Scripture had reproved. But Luke, who tells of Jesus at his bap¬tism, makes mention of no woman. Matthew, as we said, names Tamar who by deception, lay with her father-in-law; and Ruth, the Moabite, who was not from the race of Israel; and Rahab-¬-I cannot discover her lineage; and the wife of Uriah, who violated her husband's bed. For, our Lord and Savior had come for this end, to take upon himself men's sins. God "made him who had committed no sin to be sin for our sake." For this reason, he came down into the world and look on the person of sinners and depraved men. He willed to be born from the stock of Solomon, whose sins have been re¬corded, and from Rehoboam, whose transgressions are re¬ported," and from the rest of them, many of whom "did evil in the sight of the Lord." 
… 3. But, when he rises up from the washing and his ancestry is described for a second time, [i.e. by Luke], he is born not through Solo¬mon but through Nathan. Nathan reproached his father for the death of Uriah and the birth of Solomon.* But in Matthew the word "begot" is always added, whereas Luke is completely silent on the matter. In Matthew it is written, "Abraham begot Isaac; Isaac begot Jacob; Jacob begot Judah and his brothers; Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Right up to the end, "begot" is always added. But in Luke, when Jesus comes up from baptism, the passage says, "The son, as it was believed, of Joseph." And, in such a long series of names the word for "begetting" is never recorded, except that "he was thought to be the son of Joseph." 
*Origen assumes that Nathan the prophet was also a son of David.
Origen, Homily 28 on Luke, par. 1-3.

5. But we also have to consider the passage that reads, "about thirty years old." Joseph was about thirty years old" when he was released from his chains and interpreted Pharaoh's dream. He was made the governor of Egypt. During the time of plenty, he gathered in the wheat, so that during the time of famine he would have some to distribute. I think that Joseph's age of thirty came before as a type of the Savior's thirty years. For, this second Joseph did not gather in the kind of wheat that the first Joseph did in Egypt. Jesus gathers in true and heavenly wheat, so that in the time of abundance he might gather in the wheat that he will give out when famine is sent upon Egypt--not hunger for bread or thirst for water, but hunger to hear the word of God. 
Origen, Homily 28 on Luke, par. 5.

{Canon of Scripture}
6. So, during time of plenty, Jesus gathers in words from the Prophets, the Law, and the apostles. Scripture is now no longer being written, and no other New Testament is being put to¬gether. And no apostles are being sent. But Jesus has gathered the crop into the grain-barns of the apostles, that is, into their souls and the souls of all the saints. May he then distribute it and nourish Egypt which is threatened by famine, and espe¬cially his brothers.
Origen, Homily 28 on Luke, par. 6.

{Lk 4:1-2}
2. Thus Scripture says, "But he was led into the desert by the Spirit for forty days and he was tempted by the devil." Jesus was tempted for forty days. We do not know what the temptations were. . . . [Perhaps] the world could not have born the forty days of temptations with which the Lord was tempted by the devil, if Scripture had related them. It is enough for us to know only this "For forty days he was in the desert and was tempted by the devil. And he did not eat anything during those days." He was mortifying the sensations of the flesh by an unbroken and unremitting fast. 
Origen, Homily 29 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 4:1-2; Lk 4:4; Christ, Two Natures; Preface to John}
4. And let us see at the same time that it is not the Son of God who says this, but the humanity whom the Son of God deigned to assume. For, it is as a man that he answers and says, "Scripture says, man will not live by bread alone." This makes it clear that not God, but man, was tempted. … 5. After carefully winnowing through the meaning of the Scriptures, I believe I have found the reason why only Matthew, Luke, and Mark, but not John, described the temptation of the Lord. John made God his starting point. He said, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." So He could not construct a sequence of divine generation. He only stated that the Word was from God and with God. He added, "And the Word was made flesh." John was speaking about God, and God cannot be tempted. Thus, he does not mention his being tempted by the devil. But the "Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ" in the Gospel Ac¬cording to Matthew tells of him as a man who was born of Mary. Luke, too, describes his ancestry. And in Mark, he is also tempted as a man. So in each case he gives the same answer "Man will not live by bread alone." If the Son of God was God made man for you, and was tempted, then you, who are man by nature, should not complain if perhaps you are tempted. 
Origen, Homily 29 on Luke, par. 4-5.

{Lk 4:5-8; Rom 6:12; Jn 14:30}
1. Christ reigns to save. And, if we are faithful, Christ, who is Word, Wisdom, Justice, and Truth, reigns over each of us. But, if we are lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, then sin reigns over us. The Apostle says of it, "Therefore, let not sin reign in your mortal body." Hence, two rival kings eagerly strive to reign: the devil, the king of sin, over sinners; and Christ, the King of Justice, over the just. The devil knew that Christ had come to take away his kingdom and to begin to subject those who had been under him to Christ. Therefore, "he showed him all the kingdoms of the world" and of the men of this world.
… 2. And we should not think that, when the devil showed Jesus the kingdoms of the world, he showed him, for example, the kingdom of the Persians, and of the Indians. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world," that is, his own kingdom, how he reigned in the world. The devil urged Christ to do what he willed, so that he would have even Christ as his subject. The devil says, "Do you want to reign over all of these?" He shows him countless multitudes of people whom he holds under his power. And indeed, if we want to confess our wretchedness [i.e. human wretchedness] and our unhappiness openly, the devil is king of almost the entire world. This is why the Savior calls him "the prince of this world."
Origen, Homily 30 on Luke, par. 1-2.

{Lk 4:5-8}
3. So the devil says to the Lord, "Have you come to do battle against me and to take from my kingdom those whom 1 now hold subject? I do not want you to contend. I do not want you to struggle, lest you be afflicted during the contest. There is only one thing 1 ask of you: "Fall down and adore me," and then take the whole kingdom that I possess." Our Lord and Savior does indeed wish to reign, and to have all nations sub¬ject to himself, so that they will devote themselves to justice, truth, and the rest of the virtues. But he wills to reign as Justice, so that he would reign without sin, and do nothing dishonor¬able. He does not will to be crowned without toil, as the devil's subject, or to reign over others when he himself is ruled by the devil.
Origen, Homily 30 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 4:9-12; Ps 91:11-12; 2 Cor 3:6}
2. "So the devil led him into Jerusalem, placed him upon the parapet of the temple, and said to him, If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here. He led him to the roof, to the highest point of the temple, and urged him to throw himself headlong from there. The devil proposed this dishon¬estly and, under the pretext of having Christ display his glory, strove for a different end. So the Savior stated. "Scripture says, You shall not test the Lord your God." Consider, too, how the devil tempts. He does not dare to tempt [Jesus] with any means other than the Divine Books. He takes his text from the Psalms and says, "If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down. For Scripture says, "He gave his angels a command concerning you, that they should raise you up in their hands, lest perhaps you strike your foot against a stone." How can you, O devil, know that these words have been written? Have you read the proph¬ets, or do you know the divine utterances? Even though you remain silent, I shall answer for you. You read, not to become better through reading the holy books, but to use the simple, literal sense for killing those who are the friends of the letter; You know that, if you wish to speak to him from other books, (i.e. secular books) you will not deceive him, nor will your assertions have any authority. 
Origen, Homily 31 on Luke, par. 2.

{Marcion; Mt 7:15-16}
3. Marcion reads the Scriptures as the devil does. . . . Whenever you hear quo¬tations from the Scriptures, be careful of trusting the speaker immediately. Consider the person: what sort of a life he leads, what sort of opinions he holds, what sort of intention he has. Otherwise, he might pretend that he is holy and not be holy, and, infected with the poisons of heresy, he might be a wolf concealed in a sheep's skin. The devil might even be in him, citing the Scriptures.
Origen, Homily 31 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 4:9-12; Titus 1:12; Acts 17:28; 1 Cor 15:33}
3. (con't) When an opportune moment arises, the devil cites the Scriptures. For the benefit of those who hear him, Paul does the opposite. He quotes passages not only from the Scriptures, but even from secular books. He says, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies." (Titus 1:12) And again from another author, "For, we are also his offspring." (Acts 17:28) And once more, from a comic playwright, "Evil conversations corrupt good morals." (1 Cor 15:33) But, even if the devil speaks from the Scriptures, he could not deceive me by this action, nor, if Paul takes an illustra¬tion from Gentile literature, will he turn me against his elo¬quence. For, Paul takes words even from what is foreign to us to sanctify them.
1. Quoting Epimenides, a philosopher of the 6th century BC. On Oracles.
2. Quoting Aratus, an epic poet of the the 3rd and 4th centuries B.C. Phaenomena 5.
3. Quoting Menander, comic writer of the 3rd and 4th centuries B. C. Thais.
Origen, Homily 31 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 4:9-12; Ps 91:1; Ps 91:7}
5. Read the ninetieth psalm," which begins, "He who dwells in the help of the Most High remains in the protection of the God of heaven" and you will find that this [passage] fits the righteous man more than the Son of God. "A thousand will fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but he will not come near to you. But you will see with your eyes, and you will behold the retribution of sinners," and the rest; you should interpret these words as applying to the person of the righteous man. 
Origen, Homily 31 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 4:9-12; Ps 91:13-14}
6. So the devil adduces texts from Scripture so per¬versely as to assert that passages applying to the just should be applied to the Savior. Meanwhile, he remains silent about and passes over verses that have been written against him. For, when he quoted, "He has given his angels a command con¬cerning you, that they should raise you up in their hands, lest perhaps you strike your foot against a stone," he was silent about what follows "You will walk on the asp and the basilisk, and you will tread the lion and the dragon underfoot." (Ps 91:13-14) Why do you keep silence about these words, O devil, unless you are the basilisk and the petty ruler of all serpents? your poisons are more harmful than those of other snakes, for, as soon as you see someone, you kill him. … 7. You are the "dragon" and you are the "lion" of which Scrip¬ture says, "You will walk on the asp and the basilisk, and you will tread the lion and the dragon underfoot." Go ahead and keep silent. We, however, read the Scriptures more correctly. We know we have the power to tread you underfoot; we know that this word has been given to us. For, I say, it was given not only in the Old Testament, as this psalm states, but also in the New Testament. For, the Savior says, "Behold, I give you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and every power of the enemy, and nothing will harm you." (Lk 10:19) Encouraged by this power, we should take up these great weapons and accomplish everything. Through our lives we should tread the lion and the dragon underfoot.  
Origen, Homily 31 on Luke, par. 6-7.

{Lk 4:14}
1. The passage says, "Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit." "Power" has been added, because he had trodden down the dragon and conquered the tempter in hand-¬to-hand combat. So Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to the land of Galilee, and reports about him went out to the whole surrounding region.
Origen, Homily 32 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 4:15}
2. When you read, "He was teaching in their synagogues and was glorified by all," beware of thinking that only they were blessed. [Don't] believe that you have been deprived of his teaching. If the Scriptures are true, then the Lord speaks not only there, in the congregations of the Jews, but today too, in this congregation. And Jesus teaches not only in this congrega¬tion, but in other gatherings, and in the whole world. . . . So Jesus seeks instruments through which he can teach his word or instruct the people in the assemblies and be glorified by all. Jesus is "glorified by all" more now than at that time when he was known in only one province.
Origen, Homily 32 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 4:14-20; Mt 10:29-30; Providence, God's}
3. Thereupon, "he came to Nazareth, when he had been reared, and, according to custom, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. And the book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. And he opened the scroll and found the place where it is written, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me. For this reason he anointed me." It was no accident that he opens the scroll and finds the chapter of the reading that prophesies about him. This too was an act of Gods provi¬dence. For Scripture says, "A sparrow does not fall into a net without the Fathers willing it," and, "The hairs of the head" of the apostles "have all been counted." So perhaps this too should be thought to have happened not by accident or by chance, but by the providence and disposition of God. 
Origen, Homily 32 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 4:19}
5. "To preach an acceptable year to the Lord." Following the simple sense of the text, some say that the Savior preached the Gospel in Judea for only one year, and that this is what the passage "to preach an acceptable year of the Lord and a day of retribution" means. But perhaps the divine word has concealed some mystery in the preaching of a year of the Lord. . . . But all of this has been proclaimed so that we may come to "an acceptable year of the Lord," when we see after blindness, when we are free from our chains, and when we have been healed of our wounds. 
Origen, Homily 32 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 4:23; Rom 11:25-26}
2. There will be a time when the people of the Jews will say, "Whatever we have heard was done in Capernaum"--that is, signs and wonders among the Gentiles—"do among us, too, in your native territory. What you have shown to the whole world, show to us as well. Preach your word to the people of Israel, so that at least "when the full number of the Gentiles has entered in, then all of Israel will be saved." 
Origen, Homily 33 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 4:24}
3. It is true that Jeremiah was not accepted in Anathoth, his native land; nor was Isaiah, whatever his native land was, nor the rest of the prophets. But it seems to me that the passage should be understood this way we say that the native land of all the prophets was the people of the circumcision. This people received neither the prophets nor their prophecies. But, then, the Gentiles, who had been far from the prophets and had no knowledge of them, received the prophecy of Jesus Christ. So, "no prophet is accepted in his native country," that is, among the people of the Jews. We [Gentiles] were foreign to the covenant and alien to the promises. But we received the prophets with all our hearts.
Origen, Homily 33 on Luke, par. 3.

{Lk 4:23-27; 1 Cor 10:18; 2 Kings 5:10; Baptism}
5. He also says something else which pertains to the same meaning: "There were many lepers in Israel in the days of Eli¬jah the prophet, and not one of them was made clean, but only Naaman the Syrian. He too was not from Israel. Consider that right up to the present day there are many lepers in "Israel according to the flesh." (1 Cor 10:18) Realize, in contrast, that men covered with the filth of leprosy are cleansed in the mystery of baptism by the spiritual Elijah, our Lord and Savior. To you he says, "Get up and go into the Jordan and wash, and your flesh will be restored to you." (2 Ki 5:10)
Origen, Homily 33 on Luke, par. 5.

{Lk 10:25-28 }
1. IN THE LAW there are many precepts, in the Gospel the Savior laid down only two. By a kind of short cut, they lead those who obey them to eternal life. In this regard, the teacher of the Law had questioned Jesus and said, "Master, what shall I do to possess eternal life? This pas¬sage, from the Gospel According to Luke, was read to you to¬day. Jesus responded to this as follows "What is written in the Law? How do you read it?" The teacher replied, "You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with all your strength and with your whole mind; and your neighbor as yourself." Then Jesus said, "You have answered well. Do this, and you shall live."
Origen, Homily 34 on Luke, par. 1.

{Lk 10:25-28; Parable of the Good Samaritan}
3. One of the elders wanted to interpret the parable as follows. The man who was going down is Man. Jerusalem is para¬dise, and Jericho is the world. The robbers are hostile powers. The priest is the Law, the Levite is the prophets, and the Samaritan is Christ. The wounds are disobedience, the beast is the Lord's body. The pandochium (that is, the inn)," which ac¬cepts all who wish to enter is the Church. And further, the two denarii mean the Father and the Son. The manager of the inn is the head of the Church, to whom its care has been entrusted. And the fact that the Samaritan promises he will return represents the Savior's second coming. … 4. All of this has been said reasonably and beautifully. But we should not think that it applies to every man. For not every man "goes down from Jerusalem into Jericho," nor do all dwell in this present world for that reason.
Origen, Homily 34 on Luke, par. 4.

{Lk 10:30; Greek-robber}
4. (con't) But still, he does not fall among thieves, but among robbers, who are far worse than thieves.
Origen, Homily 34 on Luke, par. 4.

{Lk 10:25-28; Parable of the Good Samaritan}
5. [Origen largely accepts the interpretation given by the unnamed elder:] But it happened that first a priest, and then a Levite, were going down on the same road. Perhaps they had done some good to other men, but not to this man, who had gone down "from Jerusalem to Jericho." For, the priest saw him--I think this means the Law. And the Levite saw him--that is, in my view, the Prophetic word. When they had seen him, they passed by and left him. Providence was saving the half-dead man for him who was stronger than the Law and the Prophets, namely for the Samaritan. The name means "guardian." … 6. You should know that, according to Gods providence, this Samaritan was going down to care for the man who had fallen among thieves. You learn that clearly from the fact that he had bandages, oil, and wine with him. I do not think that the Samaritan carried these things with him only on behalf of that one, half-dead man, but also on behalf of others who, for various reasons, had been wounded and needed bandages, oil, and wine. … 
Lk 10:25-37; Ps 104:15; Mt 11:28
7. He had oil. Scripture says of it, "to gladden ones face with oil"--without doubt, it means the face of him who was healed. He cleans the wounds with oil to reduce the swelling of the wounds, but also with wine, adding in something that stings. And the man who had been wounded "he placed on his own beast," that is, on his own body, since he deigned to assume a man." This Samaritan "bears our sins" and grieves for us. He carries the half-dead man, and brings him to the pandochium¬, that is, the Church, which accepts everyone and denies its help to no one. Jesus calls everyone to the Church when he says, "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I shall refresh you." …
8. After he has brought him in, he does not depart immedi¬ately. He remains for a day at the inn with the half-dead man. He cares for his wounds not only during the day, but also at night. He devotes all his attention and activity to him. And, when he wants to set out in the morning," he takes two denarii" from his tested silver, from his tested money, and pays the inn¬keeper. Without a doubt the inn-keeper was the angel of the Church, whom the Samaritan bade to care for the man dili¬gently and bring him back to health. For a short time he himself cared for the man. "Two denarii" appear to me to be knowledge of the Father and the Son, and understanding of how the Fa¬ther is in the Son and the Son is in the Father.
1 Cor 4:16
9. The Samaritan, "who took pity on the man who had fallen among thieves," is truly a "guardian," and a closer neighbor than the Law and the Prophets. He showed that he was the man's neighbor more by deed than by word. According to the passage that says, "Be imitators of me, as I too am of Christ," (1 Cor 4:16) it is possible for us to imitate Christ and to pity those who "have fallen among thieves." We can go to them, bind their wounds, pour in oil and wine, put them on our own beasts, and bear their burdens. The Son of God encourages us to do things like this. He is speaking not so much to the teacher of the Law as to us and to all men when he says, "Go and do likewise." If we do, we shall obtain eternal life in Christ Jesus.
Origen, Homily 34 on Luke, par. 5-9.

{Lk 12:57-59; Mt 5:25-26}
1. "When you go on your way to a ruler with your adversary, make an effort to be freed from him, lest perhaps he should hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the debt collector, and you be sent to prison. Amen, I say to you, you will not get out of there until you pay back the last lepton." I see four persons mentioned here: the adversary, the ruler, the judge, and the debt collector. 
1. (con't) The evangelist Mat¬thew seems to have said something similar when he wrote, "Be gracious to your adversary while you are on your way with him." (Mt 5:25-26) Hence, I ask whether this passage has the same sense as Luke's or whether there is merely some similarity. In Matthew's ver¬sion, one person is omitted and another is changed.
2. The "ruler" is omitted. For the "debt collector," Matthew has "servant." Both Matthew and Luke include the "adversary" and the "judge." Therefore, we go with our adversary to a ruler. While we are still on the way, we should work courageously to be freed from him. From whom? The word is ambiguous, and could refer either to the ruler or to the adversary, lest perhaps he –either the adversary or the ruler--"should hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the debt collec¬tor," and "you will not get out of there until you pay back the last lepton." Matthew says for this "until you pay back the last kodranten." Each of them kept the word "last." But they seem to diverge, insofar as Matthew says "kodranten" whereas Luke wrote "lepton." 
Jn 14:6
9. So, "make an effort to be freed" from your adversary and from the ruler to whom your adversary brings you. . . . Unless you make an effort, you will be unable to annul your adversary's compact. His "friendship is enmity against God. "When you go on the way to the ruler with your adversary, make an effort." Some mystery or some secret lies hidden in the phrase, "on the way, make an effort." The Savior says, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life." If you make an effort to be freed from your enemy, then you are on the way. And, when you stand in him who says, "I am the Way," it is not enough simply to stand. Rather, "make an effort to be freed" from your adversary. For, unless you make an effort to be freed from your adversary, listen to what will follow for you. The adversary "brings you to the judge"; or rather, when the ruler receives you from the adversary, he takes--actually, "drags"--you to the judge. What a fine word, "drags." It shows that they are in a sense dragged reluctantly and unwillingly, and forced to be condemned. For what mur¬derer goes to the judge at a rapid pace? Who hastens to go joyfully to his condemnation, and is not dragged unwillingly and with resistance? …
10. Lest perhaps he should drag you before the judge." Who do you think that judge is? I do not know any other judge besides our Lord Jesus Christ. Of him the Scripture says else-where, "He will put the sheep on the right, but the goats on the left." And again, "Whoever confesses me before men, him shall I also confess before my Father who is in heaven. But, whoever denies me before men, him shall I deny before my Father who is in heaven." "Lest perhaps he should drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the debt collec-tor." Each one of us incurs a penalty for each single sin, and the size of the penalty is reckoned according to the quality and nature of the offense." …
11. Each one receives a sentence with a different fine, ac¬cording to the quality and quantity of his sin. If your sin is small, a fine of a lepton is inflicted on you, as Luke writes, or a kodranten, as Matthew has it. But you must pay even this debt, because it makes you a debtor. For, "You will not get out of prison unless you have repaid even the smallest debts." Whoever is faithful receives no penalty, however, but is enriched daily. . . . One is sentenced to pay a denarius, another a mina, another a talent. There is one who investigates this trans¬action. He knows the measure of every sin and says, "This of¬fense entails a fine of one talent; that sin merits a penalty of this or that sort." Scripture says, "But, when he began to draw up an account." (Mt 18:24) An account is to be drawn up for each of us. There is no other time to give an account except the time of judgment. Then, what has been entrusted to us, and what gains and losses we have made, will be clearly known. We shall know which one of us received a mina, or one talent, or two, or five. Why is it necessary to go over more examples? It is enough to have said this in general. We are going to have to give an ac¬count and, if we are found to be debtors, we shall he dragged to the judge, and the judge will hand us over to the debt collector. …
12. If I render all things due to everyone, then 1 shall come to the debt collector and answer with an untroubled heart, "I owe you nothing." …
13. The debt collector comes to claim his due. I resist him. I know that, if owe nothing, he has no power over me. But, if I am a debtor, the debt collector will send me to prison, follow¬ing the order we have spoken of. For, the adversary brings me to the ruler, and the ruler to the judge; the judge will hand me over to the debt collector, and the debt collector will put me in prison. What law governs that prison? I shall not come out of it, nor will the debt collector allow me to go out, unless 1 have paid every debt. The debt collector does not have the power to cancel even a kodranten of the debt, or the smallest por¬tion of it, for me. There is only one who can cancel a debt when the debtors are unable to pay their debts. Scripture says, "One man came to him who owed five hundred denarii, and another who owed fifty. Since they did not have the money to pay him, he forgave both of them. He who forgave is the Lord. But he who collects debts is not the Lord, but one whom the Lord assigns to collect debts. …
Origen, Homily 35 on Luke, par. 13.
15. For this reason, "we should make an effort to be freed from our adversary" while we are on the way. Then we can be joined to the Lord Jesus, to whom is glory and power for ages of ages.
Origen, Homily 35 on Luke, par. 1-15.

{Lk 17:20-21; Lk 17:33; Rom 6:12}
2. But the Pharisees also asked the Savior about the Kingdom of God, "when it would come." He answered, "The Kingdom of God does not come through watching. And they do not say, See, here or See, there, For the Kingdom of God is within you." The Savior does not say to everyone, "The Kingdom of God is within you." For, in sinners, the kingdom of sin exists. Without any ambiguity, either the Kingdom of God reigns in our hearts, or the kingdom of sin. For this reason, we should attentively ponder what we do and speak and think. Then we shall see whether the Kingdom of God or the kingdom of sin reigns in us. The Apostle knew that this difference existed. He warns some people and says, "Let sin not reign in your mor¬tal bodies." 
Origen, Homily 36 on Luke, par. 2.

{Lk 19:41-45; Mt 5:4-5; Mt 11:29; Mt 5:9; Eph 2:14-15}
1. By his example, Jesus confirms all the beatitudes that he speaks in the Gospel. By his own witness, he confirms what he teaches. "Blessed are the meek," he says. He says something similar to this of himself "learn from me, for I am meek." "Blessed are the peacemakers." And what other man brought as much peace as my Lord Jesus, who "is our peace," who "dis¬solves enmity," and "destroys it in his own flesh"? "Blessed are they who suffer persecution on account of justice."
2. No one suffered such persecution on account of justice as the Lord Jesus did, who was crucified for our sins. Thus, the Lord exhibited all the beatitudes in himself. For the sake of this likeness, he himself wept, because of what he had said "Blessed are those who weep."
Origen, Homily 38 on Luke, par. 1-2.

{Mt 22:21; Gen 1:27; Jn 14:30; Eph 6:12; 1 Cor 15:49}
4. Some people think that the Savior spoke on a single level when he said, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar"—that is, "pay the tax that you owe." Who among us disagrees about paying taxes to Caesar? …
Mt 22:21; Gen 1:27; Jn 14:30; Eph 6:12
5. There are two images in man. One he received from God when he was made, in the beginning, as Scripture says in the book of Genesis, "according to the image and likeness of God." The other image is earthly. Man received this second image later. He was expelled from Paradise on account of disobedience and sin, after the "prince of this world" had tempted him with his enticements. For, just as the coin, or de¬narius, has an image of the emperor of this world, so he who does the works of "the ruler of the darkness" bears the image of him whose works he does. Jesus commanded that his image should be handed over and cast away from our face. He wills us to take on that image according to which we were made from the beginning, according to Gods likeness. And thus it happens that we give "to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what is God's.
…
6. Paul also uttered this conclusion and said, "As we bear the image of the earthly man, we should also bear the image of the heavenly man." (1 Cor 15:49) When Christ says, "Give to Caesar what is Caesars," he means this "Put off the person of the earthly man, cast out the earthly image, so that you can put on your¬selves the person of the heavenly man and give to God what is Gods."
Origen, Homily 39 on Luke, par. 4-6.

{Lk 4:3-4; Mk 1:13}
Mark and Luke say that Jesus "was tempted for forty days." . . . And, since there was no food anywhere, because the whole region was a desert, Satan knew that bread would satisfy Christs hunger. He himself does not produce bread, because Christ was not going to take it from the enemy. But he commands him to make bread from the stones that he points to. And--behold his wiles and his great wickedness--he tried to keep Christ from knowing his plot. He did not simply say, "Turn the stones into loaves of bread," but he prefixed it with, "If you are a son of God." He did this to show that he wanted this act done to prove that Christ is a son of God. For, he was thinking that Christ would be provoked by his words and offended by the suggestion that he was not a "son of God." He thought that Christ would not recognize the deception.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 96.

{Lk 4:18-19; Jn 1:9; 1 Jn 2:8; Greek-reward}
I. For, he set free those who were captives, and overpowered the rebellious tyrant--that is, Satan. He shined the intelligi¬ble, divine, and heavenly light upon those whose hearts had been darkened, as he himself says "I, the light, have come into the world." He freed from bonds--clearly, from bondage to sin--those whose hearts had been shattered. He manifested the life to come and threatened just judgment. He proclaimed "a year acceptable to the Lord," in which the announcement of the Savior took place. For, I think that the "acceptable year" means his first coming, and "the day of reward " means the day of judgment. He proclaimed a "year acceptable to the Lord," which the all-wise Paul mentions when he says, "Be¬hold, now is the acceptable time, now is the day of salvation.". 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 100.

{Lk 4:18-19; Christus Victor}
II. "and deliverance to captives." What captives does he mean, except those whom the devil had just taken prisoner and put in chains? Christ came and overpowered the impostor and the rebellious tyrant, Satan, and liberated the captives. Luke says that these same people were blind and broken. For, Christ shined the intelligible light upon those whose minds had been darkened.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 100.

{Lk 4:40; Lk 4:38}
About sunset, or after the day ended, they brought the sick. Either they were ashamed, or they feared the Pharisees, or they were also engaged in other matters, or perhaps they thought it was impossible to heal on the Sabbath. For, the evangelist indicated that "he was teaching them on the Sab¬bath." (Luke 4:38) Therefore, their relatives brought the sick at sunset, and "he healed them." 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 103.

{Lk 5:27; Preface to Matthew}
So, the Scripture says, "He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi." This man is Matthew the Evangelist. Mark and Luke conceal his name by using his earlier name, whereas Matthew makes his own name known when he says, "He saw Matthew the tax collector." He says this so that we might won¬der at the skill of the God who healed him and might believe in God fully. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 108.

{Lk 6:21; Job 8:21; Isaac}
Christ announces the laughter that comes from joy and cheerfulness, as Scripture says in the Book of Job "He will fill the truthful mouth with laughter." Perhaps this is why even one of the patriarchs is called "laughter"--because the name signifies divine cheerfulness. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 110.

{Lk 8:16; Heb 9:2; Ex 25:31; Tabernacle; John the Baptist}
(a) He who wants to apply "the lamp" to the most perfect of Jesus disciples will put us to shame by the words spoken about John [the Baptist], that "he was the lamp that burns and shines." But, also, "the eye is the lamp of the body." "the eye" refers to each one's mind. The phrase, "let your lamps be burning," was spoken to all of Jesus disciples. Accordingly, one should not conceal the burning, intelligible lamp of the soul, but place it on a lampstand. Moses "placed" a type of this lamp¬stand "in the tent of witness."
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 121.

{Lk 8:41-44}
Luke added what Matthew did not say that the synagogue leader's daughter was twelve years old. The woman with the flow of blood had the flow for twelve years." So the woman's flow of blood began when the girl was born.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 125.

{Lk 9:25; 1 Jn 5:16-17}
There is a sin that is the death of the soul; John calls it "mortal sin." There is also a sin that is a weakness of the soul, and a sin that is a loss of the soul, since the word "to forfeit" is used here.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 129.

{Lk 9:28; Mt 17:1}
Luke 9.28 
"About eight days passed after these words," Matthew says "six," since he counts neither the day on which the words were spoken nor the day on which Jesus was transfigured, but only the six in between. But Luke includes all the days. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 138.

{Lk 9:28}
The Transfiguration on the mountain manifested to the disciples a token of the Savior's future glory. And he was mani¬fested corporeally, to give their mortal eyes a vision, even if they could not bear the exceeding greatness of his splendor, which was untempered and could not be borne by our eyes. The disciples showed that the glory that befits the divine essence is invisible to, and unapproachable by, any created nature; they were unable to bear even this corporeal vision mani¬fested to them upon the mountain, but fell to the earth. . . .Moses showed the face of the Law, Elijah the face of the prophets. Jesus himself was Lord of the Law and the Prophets.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 140.

{Lk 9:30}
And they conversed with each other--that is, they say things that are in mutual agreement. He clearly joins the men of the Old Covenant to the apostles, because at the second coming of Christ all the just will be joined together. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 141.

{Lk 9:36}
Jesus does not want the evidence of his glory to be spoken of before his glorification, which followed his Passion. Other¬wise his hearers, and especially the crowds who would see the one who had been so glorious crucified, would be injured. The evidence was not concealed grudgingly, but out of con¬cern that it would not be believed. For, Luke says, "And they kept silent and proclaimed to no one in those days anything of what they had seen." When did they "proclaim "? After the Ascension, and after the coming of the Spirit. For, then they were filled with the freedom to speak, and were deemed wor¬thy of the Spirit. They had the voice of the Spirit manifested in signs, and the Spirit served as their advocate. And everything that they said was well received. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 148.

{Lk 9:45; Mt 27:51}
This is what he says "Even if you do not understand these words in the present time, at the time of salvation, when you are perfectly converted to me and are stripped of the veil that I strip from you in the Passion itself, you will put your ignorance aside and understand them. You will see the symbol of it: the "veil of the temple torn asunder."
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 151.

{Lk 9:59-60; 1 Jn 3:8; Gal 5:24; Gal 2:20; Jn 8:44; Lk 14:26; Num 5:2} 
The passage has a more profound interpretation when the father had died to the young man, and was dead, then the young man was called by the Savior. I think that, just as the world was crucified to Paul, and he was dead, since the con¬cerns of the world were dead to him (for, he was no longer aiming at them as "things that are seen and are passing"), so the devil has died to every just man, who lived for him when he was a sinner. For, everyone "who commits sin is born of the devil," and the evil "father" lives for every sinner who lives for the things of this world. But, to everyone to whom the evil one has died, may the Savior say this "Follow me." And per¬haps the need for us to hate our father should be understood mystically in this way, if we are going to become worthy of Jesus. The words, "to bury the dead," mean, allegorically, only our own dead. For, somehow the dead bury "their own dead" in themselves and become their own graves and monu¬ments. Finally, the one who obeys Jesus leaves the dead man behind and no longer touches him. For he knows that the 
one who touches a corpse is defiled.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 156.

{Lk 10:1; Prov 18:19; Eccl 4:9; Mt 10:2-4}
But Luke says this about the seventy disciples, whereas Mark says. "He called the Twelve and sent them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits." Serving the Word "two by two" by God's will seems to be an ancient practice, beginning from Moses and Aaron, when the people "went out of the land of Egypt," for God led Israel out "in the hand of Moses and Aaron." And Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, both of them of the same mind, restrained the people when they were provoked by the ten.; And Eldad and Medad, being of the same mind, both prophesied in the tent. And later, God sent Paul and Barnabas out to the Gen¬tiles, and such men were a model of those who agree, "two upon the earth." You can add to these examples the verse, "Brother helped by brother is like a fortified city," (Prov 18:19) and, "Two are good, better than [one] person." (Ecc 4:9) Matthew also shows that the apos¬tles were ordered two by two, in his list of them, for he arranges them in pairs.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 158.

{Lk 17:21}
Just as you heal bodies, so also save souls by teaching. He now calls himself the Kingdom of God, as if he were saying, "King and God." It has come near," he says, "and will now dwell within you. Make yourselves worthy and be prepared to receive him."
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 159.

{Lk 10:1; Mt 7:13}
(a) Observe that the cities that do not receive the apostles and their sound teaching" have broad streets [plateias], analogous to the passage, "Wide is the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who pass through it." 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 161.

{Lk 10:21-22; Jn 8:56-58; Greek-Aorist tense}
We say to them that the words "to whom the Son wishes to reveal it" apply not only to future time, about which the Savior spoke these words to us, but also to past time. For, the words, "to reveal," in the aorist tense, apply to any¬one in the past. To refute them, we should use the Scripture passage that reads, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad, "When they heard these words they said, "You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham?" The Savior says, "Amen, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am," Therefore, he who spoke these words put himself into Abraham's power, so that Abraham would see his day.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 162.

{Lk 11:2; Mt 5:44-45; 1 Jn 3:9}
I think that no one can call God "Father" unless he is filled with the "spirit of sonship." And a son who glorifies his Fa¬ther calls him "Father," and keeps the commandment that says, "Love your enemies; pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father in heaven, because he makes his sun rise upon the wicked and the good, and sends rain upon the just and the unjust. Again, someone who "does justice" is begotten of God. And one who is begotten of God calls him "Father"; he has received "the seed" of God "in himself" so "he is no longer able to sin."
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 174.

{Lk 11:2; Mt 6:10}
Let death reign over me no longer. May it not hold me prisoner through sin, but "may your kingdom come" upon me, so that the passions, which now hold sway and reign over men, may cease to exist.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 176.

{Lk 11:3; Mt 6:11; Textual Criticism}
Lowly people think of corporeal bread when the Teacher says that we should not "care about tomorrow," especially if they read "the substantial bread" instead of "the bread that will come or is coming." This is clear from the saying, "For you do not know what the next day will bring."
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 181.

{Lk 11:9; Jas 4:3}
The Saviors statement, which says, "Ask and It will be given to you, " is true. It is confirmed by his words, "Everyone who asks receives." Someone might ask why some people pray and are not heard. To this one should answer that the one who comes to ask in a suitable way and neglects none of the things that contribute to obtaining what he is concerned about, he will surely receive what he asked to be given to him. But, if one who moves outside the aim of the prayer that has been handed down to us [i.e., the Lord's prayer] appears to ask, but does not ask as he should, he does not ask perfectly. If he does not receive, the words, "everyone who asks receives," are not wrong. As the Teacher also said, "everyone who comes to me on ac¬count of my teachings will receive" knowledge "of them." We take the words, "to approach the teacher," pragmatically¬, that is. It means giving earnest attention to the teacher's words, putting them into practice, and studying them. To the one who does not approach him in this way, we should say, "You have not approached him as you were urged to." James makes this point more clearly when he writes his letter that, "Some seem to ask but do not receive, for they ask wrongly, for the sake of wicked pleasures." But someone will say, "Some even ask for divine knowledge and the reception of virtues and do not receive." To him we should say that they did not want to receive the good things themselves, but to be flattered on account of them. Lovers of pleasure exult in praise. So God does not give to them, since they want to squan¬der the things they desire on pleasures. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 183.

{Lk 11:24-26; Mt 21:43; Jews, Unbelieving}
What does it mean that the evil "spirit wanders through waterless places, seeking rest and not finding it"? The water¬less places were formerly the Gentiles. But now they have been filled with divine water and no longer offer rest to the evil spirit. So, Satan turns his attention to his former home, the people of Israel. When they were in Egypt, the evil spirit dwelt among them, because they lived by the customs and laws of the Egyptians. But, after they were redeemed by God's mercy through Moses, the evil spirit left them. But now, since they have not believed in Christ but have rejected the Redeemer, "the un¬clean spirit" has assaulted them again. He found that they no longer had anything divine in them; they were deserted, and ready for him to dwell in them. Clearly he dwelt in them with all his power. The passage seems to make this clear when it says that "seven other spirits" were with him. 
. . .And, for them, "the last" became "worse than the first." For, they now suffer worse things than they did in Egypt, since they have not believed in Jesus Christ, but "have killed the pioneer of our life," and hence have been deprived of life. A prophet no longer says among them, "Thus says the Lord." There is no longer a sign among them, no longer a wonder, no longer a sign of God's manifestation and presence. For, the good things have passed over to us, the Gentiles, according to the word of Jesus, who said, "The king¬dom of God will be taken from them and given to a people that bears its fruits." We are that people to whom "the kingdom of God," the commonwealth of the Gospel, has been given. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 185.

{Lk 11:33-34; Eph 4:13}
It seems to me that in the phrase, "the lamp of the body is the eye," something like the following is revealed. The mind is the organ of sight for the whole soul and the whole man. In order to draw our attention to this point, Scripture has said, "Let your lamps be burning." As if we were lighting the lamp within us, we are made aware of our intellectual power. The verse, "No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hiding place, but upon the lampstand," is similar. Those who care about wisdom and reason and the practice of divine things light a lamp to become perfect. Perfection comes to be in a man in no other way than by his exercising his faculties on divine and intelligible things. Paul made this clear when he said, "Solid food is for the perfect, who have trained their faculties by practice to distinguish good and evil." These are they to whom one can speak of wisdom, which is spoken of to the perfect; of wisdom Scripture says, "we speak wisdom among the perfect." In the strict sense, Scripture calls our mind an "eye." The beginning of wisdom is in the mind. In the man concerned solely for simplicity, who has no duplicity, guile, division, separation, or divergence in him. But in the evil man the mind is the principle of vice and every sort of sin. Consider whether you can also interpret the word "body" figuratively, corresponding to "eye." In that case, either "the body" is taken to mean the whole soul, even though it is not bodily-for God put the mind in to man's soul--or "the body" means what¬ever exists in man apart from the mind-that is, the combina¬tion of the rest of the soul and the body. For, in the proper sense the whole soul is illuminated by the mind; but one might say that either the simplicity of the mind affects the body, for the body is led by the mind, or sin affects it, for the mind uses the body as an instrument for sin. …
I think that the meaning of the next expression is this "your body" has become "light" once you are illuminated by the lamp of the body. There is no longer any dark part in you, for you no longer sin at all. Thus the whole body will be light. Its rays can be compared to a lamp with a gleaming flash; the lamp illumines, but it does not dispel the darkness. For, illu-mination from the mind is like a gleaming flash, and the light in the body is like a lamp with gleaming rays. The body is by nature darkness, a thing to be led where the mind wills. So, if the minds of those who are unlearned and ignorant, which are by nature light, are in fact darkness, then the whole body is too--that is, the passionate part of the soul, which is the spirited and appetitive part; and the darkness is much worse. 
"See to it that the light in you is not darkness. So it is necessary for you, he says, to render your mind pure and thus to make both your words and your deeds gleam. But you do the opposite. Where you should bring forth light, you produce darkness, and bring forth envy from wicked thoughts. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 186-188.

{Lk 16:8; Gen 3:1; Greek-phronimos-5429-prudent}
But the word "wise" is sometimes applied not to one who has ac¬quired the virtue of wisdom, but as in the dismissal of the wily steward. The word can sometimes even mean "crafty," as in, "The serpent was the craftiest of all the beasts upon the earth." (Gen 3:1)
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 200.

{Lk 13:6; Rom 11:17}
He appears to compare them [Israel] to a fig tree. . . .And the tree was rejected." I think this other, fourth rejection" is the time of the Incarnation, toward which he spurs Israel on, and digs around it, and warms it," to perfect those who are warmed by the Spirit. But, since they remained fruitless after such threats, the fig tree was cut down and the Gentiles were grafted on to the root of those people; for, the root remained. …
So, we can delineate the saying concisely: the fig tree is ei¬ther the city of Jerusalem, or the synagogue of the Jews, or the whole of humanity. The master of the household, to whom the fig tree be¬longed, was God the Father, or the Savior himself. The worker in the vineyard was the Son of God. He says he has come a third time that is, through Moses, through the prophets, through himself.

In another way, it is possible to take the woman for the Church, the leaven for the Holy Spirit, and the three measures for body, spirit, and soul. These three are sanctified by the leaven of the Holy Spirit, so that by the Holy Spirit they be¬come one lump, in order that "our whole body and spirit and soul may be kept blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ," as Paul the divine says. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 205.

{Lk 16:17; Jn 12:24; Phil 2:8; Mt 5:18}
"One dot". It is not only the letter iota among the Greeks, but also, among the Hebrews, the letter they call iodh. It is possible that Jesus said, "one iota or one tittle" symbolically, since the beginning of his name, not only among the Greeks but also among the Hebrews, begins with the letter iodh. And "one iota or one tittle" is Jesus, the Word of God in the Law. He does not abolish the Law "until all things come to pass," and he "does not fall." For, he falls for the sake of salvation, to bear "much fruit." But, when he falls, it is an easier thing "for heaven and earth to pass away" than for "one tittle to fall" of what concerns him in the Law. But, "he fell into the earth" and died, to bear more fruit. He was not conquered; he "humbled himself and became obedient unto death, death on a cross." 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 221.

{Lk 16:19-21; Job 1:1}
"There was a certain rich man." . . . So, he is named by what he loved; he is called "rich," not "holy" or "just." But the poor man, who had nothing in this world, is called by the simple name of Lazarus. . . . says, "And he was clothed in purple and linen, and he feasted splendidly each day." He did not give the man's proper name, but said. "There was a certain man." to bring out the element of uncertainty by this common designation, and to stress the common, insulting element by the lack of clarity. But it is not so with the just. How is it? Scripture says, "There was a certain man in the land of Uz named Job." . . . Job was also rich, but he did not pass his life in luxury and lack of compassion. His house stood open to every needy person by his loving will. He treated no one unjustly, but helped those who suffered unjustly; he fur¬nished the things needed for life to widows and orphans. For, these are the just deeds of just rich men.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 222.

{Lk 19:41-43}
(b) This is the sense of the words since you did not "recog¬nize your peace," namely Myself, you were handed over to your enemies. Now, since peace "has been hidden from your eyes," you have no peaceful thoughts, nor do you love what has happened, but you look to contradiction." "Days will come upon you" in which "your enemies" will lord it over you ¬and intelligible enemies instead of material ones. For, exter¬nally, the Jews were conquered by Romans, but internally by unclean demons.

{Lk 23:18; Lk 19:46; Mt 21:13; Jn 18:40; Jews, Unbelieving; Greek-robber}
The Jews think and do the things of robbers [Gr lestes], and they made the house of God "a den of thieves." So, Jesus expelled them from God's house, and they shouted about the robber Barabbas "Release Barabbas to us." But, about the Savior of the world they said, "Crucify, crucify him." So, up to this day the Jews do not have Jesus, for they have not believed in the Son of God. Instead, they have among themselves Barabbas, the robber, [Gr. lestes No. 3027] (Jn 18:40) who comes from "the spirits of evil." They deemed him, who had been captured and thrown into prison among them, worthy of release. So, Barabbas the robber rules the unbelieving Jews. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 246.

{Lk 23:45; Ex 10:22}
John did not mention this event [the darkness]. Matthew and Mark specify neither the sun nor the eclipse. But Luke says, "The sun was eclipsed." . . . This hap¬pened so that they might know that the man who was hanging on the cross is he who took on himself the world when God "fought against the Egyptians on their account," and eclipsed the light of the sun, when darkness spread over their whole land. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 250.

{Lk 23:45}
It is likely that the event [rending of the veil] also suggests something else to us that the hidden things of the Law were revealed in Christ through his Passion. For, the concealing veil hung within the Holy of Holies of his time. The shadow of the Law had to be lifted. It was torn off and shows that the Holy of Holies was opened to those justified by faith in Christ. He shows the things of God to the saints, so that in the future we may ap¬proach the interior tent, with nothing barring the way.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 251.

{Lk 23:46; Tripartite Nature of Man}
"And crying out with a loud voice Jesus said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit. And after he said this, he expired." He said this because he wished to sanctify our own deaths by these words, so that we, too, as we depart the present life, may commend our spirits "into the hands" of the heav¬enly Father. 
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 252.

{Lk 24:2; Lk 24:39; Jn 20:20}
After the Resurrection the stone was removed on account of the women, so that they would believe that the Lord had risen. They saw the tomb--empty and devoid of the body. Then there follows, "And they entered and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. What is the glory of the Lords body, which Paul men¬tioned, that was revealed to the disciples in the Transfigura¬tion on the mountain? Since, after the Resurrection, he had to appear to the apostles and the five hundred disciples to confirm their faith in the resurrection, they saw him as they were able to. Just as they had known him before his Passion, he showed them the scars of his wounds.
Origen, Homilies on Luke, Fragment 254.


ORIGEN JOHN****
{Israel of God; Rom 2:29; Rev 7:2-5; Rev 14:1}
It appears to me that the whole people of Christ, when we regard it in the aspect of the hidden man of the heart, that people which is called "Jew inwardly," and is circumcised "in the spirit," has in a more mystic way the characteristics of the [twelve] tribes. . . . This may be more plainly gathered from John in his Apocalypse, though the other prophets also do not by any means conceal this state of matters.  . . . John speaks as follows: "And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels. . . . And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand who were sealed, out of every tribe of the children of Israel." . . . And he mentioned each of the tribes singly, with the exception of Dan.  . . . Then, some way further on, he continues: "And I saw, and behold the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand. . . . These are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes." . . . Now this is said in John with reference to those who have believed in Christ, for they also, even if their bodily descent cannot be traced to the seed of the patriarchs, are yet gathered out of the tribes. That this is so we may conclude from what is further said about them: "Hurt not," he says, "the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the children of Israel."  location 176061
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 1.
 
{Rev 7:2-5; Rev 14:1; Rev 14:4; Israel of God; Jews, Believing; Third Century Church; Virgins}
These, then, who are sealed on their foreheads from every tribe of the children of Israel, are a hundred and forty-four thousand in number; and these hundred and forty-four thousand are afterwards said in John to have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their foreheads, and to be virgins, not having defiled themselves with women. What else could the seal be which is on their foreheads but the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father? . . . But the number of believers is small who belong to "Israel according to the flesh." One might venture to assert that they would not nearly make up the number of a hundred and forty-four thousand. It is clear, therefore, that the hundred and forty-four thousand who have not defiled themselves with women must be made up of those who have come to the divine word out of the Gentile world. In this way the truth of the statement may be upheld that the first fruits of each tribe are its virgins. For the passage goes on: "These were brought from among men to be a first fruits to God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without blemish."  . . . The statement about the hundred and forty-four thousand no doubt admits of a figurative interpretation; but it is unnecessary [to discuss] at this point, and would divert us from our purpose. 
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 2.

{Third Century Church; Priest, Christian Use of Term}
Those of the tribes offer to God tithes and first fruits through the Levites and priests. Not everything which they possess do they regard as a tithe or first fruit. The Levites and priests, on the other hand, have no possessions but tithes and first fruits; yet they also in turn offer tithes to God through the high-priests, and, I believe, first fruits too. The same is the case with those who approach Christian studies. Most of us devote most of our time to the things of this life, and dedicate to God only a few special acts, thus resembling those members of the tribes who had but few transactions with the priest. . . . 
But those who devote themselves to the divine word and have no other employment but the service of God may not unnaturally, allowing for the difference of occupation in the two cases, be called our Levites and priests.   location 176085

{Preface to the New Testament; Canon, Old Testament; Canon, New Testament}
We may venture to say that the Gospel is the first fruits of all the Scriptures. . . .  
It must not be forgotten, however, that the first fruits are not the same as the first growth. . . . For the first fruits are offered after all the fruits (are ripe), but the first growth before them all. Now of the Scriptures which are current and are believed to be divine in all the churches, one would not be wrong in saying that the first growth is the Law of Moses, but the first fruits are the Gospel. For it was after all the fruits of the prophets who prophesied till the Lord Jesus, that the perfect Word shot forth.   location 176099   
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 4.

{Preface to the New Testament; Preface to Matthew; Mt 23:8-10; 1 Cor 12:28}
Here, however, someone may object, appealing to the notion just put forward of the unfolding of the first fruits last, and may say that the Acts and the letters of the apostles came after the Gospels, and that this destroys our argument to the effect that the Gospel is the first fruits of all Scripture. . . . The apostolic writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and that they have great authority, but that they are not on the same level with that "Thus says the Lord Almighty." Consider on this point the language of St. Paul. When he declares that "Every Scripture is inspired of God and profitable," does he include his own writings? Or does he not include his dictum, "I say, and not the Lord," and "So I ordain in all the churches," and "What things I suffered at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra," and similar things which he writes in virtue of his own authority, and which do not quite possess the character of words flowing from divine inspiration. Must we also show that the old Scripture is not Gospel, since it does not point out the Coming One, but only foretells Him and heralds His coming at a future time; . . .
[Nevertheless, in another sense,] all the new Scripture is Gospel. . . . We shall arrive at the position that whatever was written by the Apostles is Gospel. As to this second definition, it might be objected that the Epistles are not entitled "Gospel," and that we are wrong in applying the name of Gospel to the whole of the New Testament. But to this we answer that it happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more persons or things are named by the same name, the name attaches itself most significantly to one of those things or persons.   Thus the Savior says, "Call no man teacher upon the earth;" while the Apostle says that teachers have been appointed in the Church. These latter accordingly will not be teachers in the strict sense of the dictum of the Gospel. In the same way the Gospel in the Epistles will not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with the narrative of Jesus' actions and sufferings and discourses. No: the Gospel is the first fruits of all Scripture,   location 176121

{Preface to John; Preface to Matthew; Preface to Mark}
The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, "The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach," yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhood, as John does when he makes Him say, "I am the light of the world," "I am the way and the truth and the life," "I am the resurrection," "I am the door," "I am the good shepherd;" and in the Apocalypse, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last." We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures; but of the Gospels, that of John is the first fruits.   location 176130 

{Jn 19:26; Mary; Preface to John; Third Century Church}  
No one can apprehend the meaning of [John's Gospel] unless he has lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus [the assignment for] Mary to be his mother also. Such a one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, "Woman, behold your son," and not "Behold you have this son also," then He virtually said to her, "Lo, this is Jesus, whom you bore." Is it not the case that everyone who is perfect lives of himself no longer, but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, "Behold your son, Christ."   location 176139

{Preface to the New Testament}
It is possible to quote one of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain place: "According to my Gospel." Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel;   . . . But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming,   location 176150

{Preface to the New Testament; Preface to Matthew}
But it is time we should inquire what is the meaning of the designation "Gospel," and why these books have this title. Now the Gospel is a discourse containing a promise of things which naturally, and on account of the benefits they bring, rejoice the hearer as soon as the promise is heard and believed.  . . . A Gospel is either a word which implies the actual presence to the believer of something that is good, or a word promising the arrival of a good which is expected. . . . For each of the Gospels is a collection of announcements which are useful to him who believes them and does not misinterpret them; it brings him a benefit and naturally makes him glad   location 176158

{Mt 11:3; Jn 4:25; Lk 24:18-21; Jn 1:42; Jn 1:46}
For John the Baptist spoke in the name almost of the whole people when he sent to Jesus and asked, "Are you He that should come or do we look for another?" For to the people the Messiah was an expected good, which the prophets had foretold, and they all alike, though under the law and the prophets, fixed their hopes on Him, as the Samaritan woman bears witness when she says: "I know that the Messiah comes, who is called Christ; when He comes He will tell us all things."  Simon and Cleopas too, when talking to each other about all that had happened to Jesus Christ Himself, then risen, though they did not know that He had risen from the dead, speak thus, "Do you sojourn alone in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have taken place there in these days? And when he said what things? they answered, "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death and crucified Him. But we hoped that it was He which should redeem Israel." Again, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, Christ." And a little further on Philip finds Nathanael and says to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."   location 176169

{Preface to the New Testament; Rom 7:6; Jn 4:23}
With whomsoever, then, Christ has sojourned, he worships God neither at
Jerusalem nor on the mountain of the Samaritans; he knows that God is a spirit, and worships Him spiritually, in spirit and in truth; no longer by type does he worship the Father and Maker of all. Before that Gospel, therefore, which came into being by the sojourning of Christ, none of the older works was a Gospel. But the Gospel, which is the new covenant, having delivered us from the oldness of the letter, lights up for us, by the light of knowledge, the newness of the spirit, a thing which never grows old, which has its home in the New Testament, but is also present in all the Scriptures.

We must not, however, forget that the sojourning of Christ with men took place before His bodily sojourn, in a mental fashion. . . .

{Rom 2:28-29; Acts 16:3; Acts 21:26; 1 Cor 9:20}
In accordance with this we may conclude that, as it is with Him who is a Jew outwardly and circumcised in the flesh, so it is with the Christian and with baptism. Paul and Peter were, at an earlier period, Jews outwardly and circumcised, but later they received from Christ that they should be so in secret, too; so that outwardly they were Jews for the sake of the
salvation of many, and by an economy they not only confessed in words that they were Jews, but showed it by their actions. And the same is to be said about their Christianity. As Paul could not benefit those who were Jews according to the flesh, without, when reason shows it to be necessary, circumcising Timothy, and when it appears the natural course getting himself shaved and making a vow, and, in a word, being to the Jews a Jew that he might gain the Jews.

It is not skillfully composed discourse, nor the mode of delivery, nor well practiced eloquence that produces conviction, but the communication of divine power. Hence also Paul says: "I will know not the word that is puffed up, but the power; for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power." . . .

{Jn 1:1; Greek-arche}
"In the beginning [arche] was the Word." It is not only the Greeks who consider the word arche to have many meanings. Let anyone collect the Scripture passages in which the word occurs, and with a view to an accurate interpretation of it note what it stands for in each passage, and he will find that the word has many meanings in sacred discourse also. We speak of "a beginning" in reference to a transition. In the following [example], it has to do with a road and with length. This appears in the saying: "The beginning of a good way is to do justice."   location 176328   
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 16

{Jn 1:1; Greek-arche; Gen 1:1; Job 40:19; Prov 8:22}
Again, there is a beginning in a matter of origin, as might appear in the saying: "In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth." This meaning, however, appears more plainly in the Book of Job in the passage: "This is the beginning of God's creation."   . . . This meaning of the term "beginning," as of origin, will serve us also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in the Proverbs. "God," we read, "created me the beginning of His ways, for His works." Here the term could be interpreted as in the first application we spoke of, that of a way: "The Lord," it says, "created me the beginning of His ways." One might assert, and with reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all things, and might go on to say, as is plain, that the Father is the beginning of the Son; and the Creator the beginning of the works of the Creator, and that God, in a word, is the beginning of all that exists.   location 176360

{Jn 1:1; Greek-arche; Gen 1:26}
In addition to these meanings there is that in which we speak of an arche, according to form; thus if the first-born of every creature is the image of the invisible God, then the Father is his arche. In the same way Christ is the arche of those who are made according to the image of God. For if men are according to the image, but the image according to the Father;  . . . men are made, not according to that of which he is the image, but according to the image. With this example our passage will agree: "In the arche was the Word."   location 176374   
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 19

{Greek-arche; Heb 5:12; Col 1:15; 1 Cor 15:45; Jesus, Titles}
There is also an arche in a matter of learning, as when we say that the letters are the arche of grammar. The Apostle accordingly says: "When by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again that someone teach you what are the elements [arche] of the oracles of God."   . . . We might say of Christ, that by nature His arche is deity, but that in relation to us who cannot, for its very greatness, command the whole truth about Him, His arche is His manhood, as He is preached to babes, "Jesus Christ and Him crucified." In this view, then, Christ is the arche of learning in His own nature, because He is the wisdom and power of God; but for us, the Word was made flesh, that He might tabernacle among us who could only thus at first receive Him. And perhaps this is the reason why He is not only the firstborn of all creation, but is also designated the man, Adam. For Paul says He is Adam: "The last Adam was made a life-giving spirit."   location 176382   
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 20
{Greek-arche}
[design and execution] Again we speak of the arche [model or design] of an action, in which there is a design [execution??] which appears after the arche. 
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 21

{Jn 1:1; Greek-arche; Prov 8:22}
So many meanings occur to us at once of the word arche. We have now to ask which of them we should adopt for our text, "In the beginning was the Word."   . . . One might, however, think of the sense in which it points to the author, to that which brings about the effect, if, as we read, "God commanded and they were created." For Christ is, in a manner, the Creator, to whom the Father says, "Let there be light," and "Let there be a firmament." But Christ is Creator as a beginning (arche), inasmuch as He is Wisdom. [Prov 8:22] It is in virtue of His being Wisdom that He is called arche. For Wisdom says in Solomon: "God created me the beginning [arche] of His ways, for His works," so that the Word might be in an arche, namely, in wisdom.   . . . If we are at liberty to take this meaning of arche for our text: "In the beginning was the Word," so as to obtain the meaning that all things came into being according to wisdom and according to the models of the system which are present in his thoughts. For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and fashioned in accordance with the sketches of the builder or designer, the house or the ship having their beginning (arche) in the sketches and reckonings in his mind,   location 176401   
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk 1, ch. 22

{Prov 8:22; Jn 1:1; Jesus, Titles}
And we should add that having created, so to speak, "ensouled" wisdom, He left her to hand over, from the types which were in her, to things existing and to matter, the actual emergence of them, their moulding and their forms.   . . . But I consider, if it be permitted to say this, that the beginning (arche) of real existence was the Son of God, saying: "I am the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last."   . . . If we go through all His titles carefully we find that He is the arche only in respect of His being Wisdom. [i.e., Prov 8:22] Not even as the Word is He the arche, for the Word was in the arche.   . . . Wisdom is anterior to all the thoughts that are expressed in the titles of the "first-born of every creature." Now God is altogether one and simple; but our Savior, for many reasons, since God set Him forth a propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many things, or perhaps all these things; the whole creation, so far as capable of redemption, stands in need of Him.   location 176411

{Jesus, Titles of; Jn 1:1; Jn 13:13; Jn 10:36; Jn 17:1; Jn 18:33}
Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning. I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Savior, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term "Word." I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, "I am the light of the world," and in another, "I am the resurrection," and again, "I am the way and the truth and the life." It is also written, "I am the door," and we have the saying, "I am the good shepherd," and 309 when the woman of Samaria says, "We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things," Jesus answers, "I that speak unto you am He." Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words4553 to be their Master and Lord: "You call me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am." He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,4554 "He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, You blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?" and4555 "Father, the hour is come; glorify Your Son, that the Son also may glorify You." We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,4556 "Art You the King of the Jews?" by saying, "My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence."

And in his catholic Epistle ,John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus: "And if anyone sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous," and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, . . . According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the Wisdom and the Power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:  . . . But he [Paul] also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest: "Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."   . . . And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons says, "Judah, your brethren shall extol you; your hands are on the necks of your enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art you sprung up; you have lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him?"   . . .

That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says: "That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry," etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God: "I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd." For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ.   . . . Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower: "There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of this root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him"   location 176474

And he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:4569 "Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God." According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:4570 "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God." It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: "He was made to us of God," he says, "wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption." But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:4571 "Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession." And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons4572 says, "Judah, your brethren shall extol you; your hands are on the necks of your enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art you sprung up; you have lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him?" We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., "A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved;" this can better be 310 cleared up on another occasion. But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,4573 "Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul has accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall anyone hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope." That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:4574 "That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry," etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:4575 "I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd." For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:4576 "There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of this root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord." And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:4577 "The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes." And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:4578 "Have you never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust."

{Jn 1:1; Ps 45:1}
And one of the names applied to the Savior is that which He Himself does not utter, but
which John records--the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that anyone may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, "What is the Son of God when called the Word?" The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms, "My heart has produced a good Word;" and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be "Word" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests and apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course.  location 176482

{Gen 1:14-19; Gen 1:3-5}
Now the visible light of the world is the sun, and after it comes very worthily the moon, and the same title may be applied to the stars; but those lights of the world are said in Moses to have come into existence on the fourth day, and as they shed light on the things on the earth, they are not the true Light.

Thus we see the Church, the bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and the disciples have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the true sun, so that they are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of light in themselves.   location 176511

For the world in one sense is not only men. Paul shows that the world is something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first Epistle: "We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men." In one sense, too, it may be considered, the world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. . . . For those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labors and a life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body. . . .

Now He is called the light of men and the true light and the light of the word, because He brightens and irradiates the higher parts of men, or, in a word, of all reasonable beings. And similarly it is from and because of the energy with which He causes the old deadness to be put aside and that which is par excellence life to be put on, so that those who have truly received Him rise again from the dead, that He is called the resurrection. And this He does not only at the moment at which a man says, "We are buried with Christ through baptism and have risen again with Him," but much rather when a man, having laid off all about him that belongs to death, walks in the newness of life which belongs to Him, the Son, while here.

[Origen or Rufinus??]: Further, the Only-begotten is the truth, because He embraces in Himself according to the Father's will the whole reason of all things, and that with perfect clearness, and being the truth communicates to each creature in proportion to its worthiness. And should anyone enquire whether all that the Father knows, according to the depth of His riches and His wisdom and His knowledge, is known to our Savior also, and should he, imagining that he will thereby glorify the Father, show that some things known to the Father are unknown to the Son, although He might have had an equal share of the apprehensions of the unbegotten God, we must remind him that it is from His being the truth that He is Savior, and add that if He is the truth complete, then there is nothing true which He does not know; truth must not limp for the want of the things which, according to those persons, are known to the Father only. Or else let it be shown that some things are known to which the name of truth does not apply, but which are above the truth.

But as one cannot be in the Father or with the Father except by ascending from below upwards and coming first to the divinity of the Son, through which one may be led by the hand and brought to the blessedness of the Father Himself, so the Savior has the inscription "The Door." And as He is a lover of men, and approves the impulse of human souls to better things, even of those who do not hasten to reason (the Logos), but like sheep have a weakness and gentleness apart from all accuracy and reason, so He is the Shepherd.   location 176582

{Ps 45:8; Ps 72:1-2; Messianic Prophecies; Tripartite Nature of Man}
That [title] of Christ, and we must also consider that of King, and compare these two so as to find out the difference between them. Now it is said in the forty-fourth Psalm, "You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, whence You are anointed (Christ) above your fellows." His loving righteousness and hating iniquity were thus added claims in Him; His anointing was not contemporary with His being nor inherited by Him from the first. Anointing is a symbol of entering on the kingship, and sometimes also on the priesthood; and must we therefore conclude that the kingship of the Son of God is not inherited nor congenital to Him? But how is it conceivable that the First-born of all creation was not a king and became a king afterwards . . . We cannot fail to see that it is as a man that He is Christ, in respect of His soul, which was human and liable to be troubled and sore vexed, but that He is conceived as king in respect of the divine in Him. I find support for this in the seventy-first Psalm, which says, "Give the king your judgment, O God, and your righteousness to the king's Son, to judge your people in righteousness and your poor in judgment." This Psalm, though addressed to Solomon, is evidently a prophecy of Christ,   location 176594

It is plain to all how our Lord is a teacher and an interpreter for those who are striving towards godliness, and on the other hand a master of those servants who have the spirit of bondage to fear,4602 who make progress and hasten towards wisdom, and are found worthy to possess it. For4603 "the servant knoweth not what the master wills," since he is no longer his master, but has become his friend. The Lord Himself teaches this, for He says to hearers who were still servants:4604 "You call me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am," but in another passage,4605 "I call you no longer servants, for the servant knoweth not what is the will of his master, but I call you friends," because4606 "you have continued with me in all My temptations." They, then, who live according to fear, which God exacts from those who are not good servants, as we read in Malachi,4607 "If I am a Master, where is My fear?" are servants of a master who is called their Savior.

To what we have said must be added how the Son is the true vine. Those will have no difficulty in apprehending this who understand, in a manner worthy of the prophetic grace, the saying:4609 "Wine makes glad the heart of man." For if the heart be the intellectual part, and what rejoices it is the Word most pleasant of all to drink which takes us off human things, makes us feel ourselves inspired, and intoxicates us with an intoxication which is not irrational but divine, that, I conceive, with which Joseph made his brethren merry,4610 then it is very clear how He who brings wine thus to rejoice the heart of man is the true vine.

There are some gods of whom God is god, as we hear in prophecy,4611 "Thank you the God of gods," and4612 "The God of gods has spoken, and called the earth." Now God, according to the Gospel,4613 "is not the God of the dead but of the living." Those gods, then, are living of whom God is god. The Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says:4614 "As there are gods many and lords many," and so we have spoken of these gods as really existing. Now there are, besides the gods of whom God is god, certain others, who are called thrones, and others called dominions, lordships, also, and powers in addition to these. The phrase,4615 "above every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come," leads us to believe that there are yet others besides these which are less familiar to us; one kind of these the Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth was formed, who is their ruler, and is none other than God. Add to all these the reasonable being who is mortal, man. Now the God of all things made first in honor some race of reasonable beings; this I consider to be those who are called gods, and the second order, let us say, for the present, are the thrones, and the third, undoubtedly, the dominions. And thus we come down in order to the last reasonable race, which, perhaps, cannot be any other than man. The Savior accordingly became, in a diviner way than Paul, all things to all, that He might either gain all or perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a man, and to the angels an angel.

{1 Cor 9:22; Isa 9:6; Ps 138:4-5; Rev 1:8; Prov 8:22}
The Savior accordingly became, in a diviner way than Paul, all things to all, that He might either gain all or perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a man, and to the angels an angel. As for His becoming man no believer has any doubt, but as to His becoming an angel, we shall find reason for believing it was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the words of the angels, in some of which the powers of the angels seem to belong to Him. In several passages angels speak in such a way as to suggest this, as when4616 "the angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire. And he said, I am the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob." But Isaiah also says:4617 "His name is called Angel of Great Counsel." The Savior, then, is the first and the last, not that He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that He became all things. Consider, however, whether the last is man, or the things said to be under the earth, of which are the demons, all of them or some. We must ask, too, about those things which the Savior became which He speaks of through the prophet David,4618 "And I became as a man without any to help him, free among the dead." His birth from the virgin and His life so admirably lived showed Him to be more than man, and it was the same among the dead. He was the only free person there, and His soul was not left in hell. Thus, then, He is the first and the last. Again, if there be letters of God, as such there are, by reading which the saints may say they have read what is written on the tablets of heaven, these letters, by which heavenly things are to be read, are the notions, divided into small parts, into Alpha and so on to Omega, the Son of God. Again, He is the beginning and the end, but He is this not in all His aspects equally. For He is the beginning, as the Proverbs teach us, inasmuch as He is wisdom; it is written: "The Lord founded me in the beginning of His ways, for His works." In the respect of His being the Logos He is not the beginning. "The Word was in the beginning." Thus in His aspects one comes first and is the beginning, and there is a second after the beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He had said, I am the beginning. inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second, perhaps, inasmuch as I am invisible, and the third in that I am life, for "what was made was life in Him." One who was qualified to examine and to discern the sense of Scripture might, no doubt, find many members of the series; I cannot say if he could find them all. "The beginning and the end" is a phrase we usually apply to a thing that is a completed unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation and the end the parapet. We cannot but think of this figure, since Christ is the stone which is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the saved. For Christ the only-begotten Son is all and in all, He is as the beginning in the man He assumed, He is present 316 as the end in the last of the saints, and He is also in those between, or else He is present as the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth, according to the saying: "The last Adam was made a quickening spirit." This saying harmonizes well with the interpretation we have given of the first and the last.

For since we were not helped by His original life, sunk as we were in sin, He came down into our deadness in order that, He having died to sin, we,4620 bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus. might then receive that life of His which is forevermore.

The mouth of the Son of God is a sharp sword, for "The word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart." And indeed He came not to bring peace on the earth, that is, to corporeal and sensible things, but a sword, and to cut through, if I may say so, the disastrous friendship of soul and body, so that the soul, committing herself to the spirit which was against the flesh, may enter into friendship with God.   location 176680

Again, let anyone consider how Jesus was to His disciples, not as He who sits at meat, but as He who serves, and how though the Son of God He took on Him the form of a servant for the sake of the freedom of those who were enslaved in sin, and he will be at no loss to account for the Father's saying to Him: "You are My servant," and a little further on: "It is a great thing that you should be called My servant." For we do not hesitate to say that the goodness of Christ appears in a greater and more divine light, and more according to the image of the Father, because "He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross," than if He had judged it a thing to be grasped to be equal with God, and had shrunk from becoming a servant for the salvation of the world. Hence He says, desiring to teach us that in accepting this state of servitude He had received a great gift from His Father: "And My God shall be My strength. And He said to Me, It is a great thing for You to be called My servant." For if He had not become a servant, He would not have raised up the tribes of Jacob, nor have turned the heart of the diaspora of Israel, and neither would He have become a light of the Gentiles for salvation to the ends of the earth.   location 176695

His representation of us with the Father, as He pleads for human nature, and makes atonement for it; the Paraclete, and the propitiation, and the atonement. He has the name Paraclete in the Epistle of John: "If any man sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." And He is said in the same epistle to be the atonement for our sins. Similarly, in the Epistle to the Romans, He is called a propitiation: "Whom God set forth to be a propitiation through faith." Of this propitiation there was a type in the inmost part of the temple, the Holy of Holies, namely, the golden mercy-seat placed upon the two cherubim.  But how could He ever be the Paraclete, and the atonement, and the propitiation without the power of God, which makes an end of our weakness, flows over the souls of believers, and is administered by Jesus, who indeed is prior to it and Himself the power of God, who enables a man to say:4632 "I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengtheneth me." Whence we know that Simon Magus, who gave himself the title of "The power of God, which is called great," was consigned to perdition and destruction, he and his money with him.

For without4640 God He tasted death foreveryone. In some copies of the Epistle to the Hebrews the words are "by the grace of God." Now, whether He tasted death foreveryone without God, He died not for men only but for all other intellectual 319 beings too, or whether He tasted death foreveryone by the grace of God, He died for all without God, for by the grace of God He tasted death foreveryone. It would surely be absurd to say that He tasted death for human sins and not for any other being besides man which had fallen into sin, as for example for the stars.

For it is He who sets them free, saving them from their enemies on whose backs He lays His hand to subdue them. When He has put under His feet the opposing power, and is alone in presence of His Father, then He is Jacob and Israel; and thus as we are made light by Him, since He is the light of the world, so we are made Jacob since He is called Jacob, and Israel since He is called Israel.

For if, by having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it may be and ruled over, then it is clear that we become in a divine manner reasonable, when He drives away from us what in us is irrational and dead, since He is the Logos (reason) and the Resurrection. location 176801

{Jn 15:22; Age of Accountability}
He says "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin," the only sense we can find in His words is that the Logos Himself says that those are not chargeable with sin to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they sin, are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by which He declares His full presence in us. Only when thus read is the saying true: "If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin." Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that they should, to the visible Christ, then how is it true that those had no sin to whom He did not come? In that case all who lived before the advent of the Savior will be free from sin, since Jesus, as seen in flesh, had not yet come. And more—all those to whom He has never been preached will have no sin, and if they have no sin, then it is clear they are not liable to judgment. But the Logos in man, in which we have said that our whole race had part, is spoken of in two senses; first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies excepted, in everyone who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but secondly, in that of the consummation, which takes place only in the perfect. The words, therefore, "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin," are to be understood in the former sense; but the words, "All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them," in the latter. For before the consummation of reason comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all is imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the obedience of those irrational elements in us which are metaphorically spoken of as sheep. And perhaps the former meaning is to be recognized in the words "The Logos was made flesh," but the second in "The Logos was God."   location 176809

{Ps 45:1}
Nor must we leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-fourth Psalm,4655 frequently 321 quoted by many writers as if they understood it: "My heart has belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King." Suppose it is God the Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good word should appear in accordance with His heart? If, as these writers suppose, the Word (Logos) needs no interpretation, then the heart is to be taken in the natural sense too. But it is quite absurd to suppose God's heart to be a part of Him as ours is of our body. We must remind such writers that as when the hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and His finger, we do not read the words literally but enquire in what sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of God, so His heart is to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all things, and His word of that which announces what is in this heart of His. But who is it that announces the counsel of the Father to those of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves, who but the Savior? That "belched forth" is not, perhaps, without significance; a hundred other terms might have been employed; "My heart has produced a good word," it might have been said, or "My heart has spoken a good word." But in belching, some wind that was hidden makes its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out views of truth not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of belching, and the word has the character of the things thus produced, and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible God. We may enter our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words, and take them to be spoken by the Father. It is not, however, a matter of course, that it is God Himself who announces these things. Why should it not be a prophet? Filled with the Spirit and unable to contain himself, he brings forth a word about his prophecy concerning Christ: "My heart has belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King, my pen is the tongue of a ready writer. Excellent in beauty is He beyond the sons of men." Then to the Christ Himself: "Grace is poured out on Your lips." If the Father were the speaker, how could He go on after the words, "Grace is poured out on your lips," to say, "Therefore God has blessed you forever," and a little further on, "Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows." Some of those who wish to make the Father the speaker may appeal to the words, "Hear, O daughter, and behold and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father." The prophet, it may be said, could not address the Church in the words, "Hear, O daughter." It is not difficult, however, to show that changes of person occur frequently in the Psalms, so that these words, "Hear, O daughter," might be from the Father, in this passage, though the Psalm as a whole is not.

{Greek-logos; Ps 33:6}
To our discussion of the Word we may here add the passage, "By the word of the Lord were the heavens founded, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth." Some refer this to the Savior and the Holy Spirit. The passage, however, does not necessarily imply any more than that the heavens were founded by the reason (logos) of God, as when we say that a house is built by the plan (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the shipbuilder. In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by the Logos of God, for they are of a more divine substance, which on this account is called solid; it has little fluidity for the most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and specially the lower parts. On account of this difference the heavens are said in a special manner to be constituted by the Logos of God.   location 176852

{Jn 1:1; Prov 8:22}
The saying then stands, first, "In the beginning was the Logos;" we are to place that full in our view; but the testimonies we cited from the Proverbs led us to place Wisdom first, and to think of wisdom as preceding the Word which announces her. We must observe, then, that the Logos is in the beginning, that is, in wisdom, always. Its being in wisdom, which is called the beginning, does not prevent it from being with God and from being God, and it is not simply with God, but is in the beginning, in wisdom, with God. For he goes on: "He was in the beginning with God."   location 176859

To this end it will be of service to remember that what is called the Word came to certain persons; as "The Word of the Lord which came to Hosea, the son of Beeri," and "The Word which came to Isaiah, the son of Amos, concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem," and "The Word which came to Jeremiah concerning the drought." . . . The comparison may enable us to find out how the Word was with God. The generality will simply look at what the prophets said, as if that were the Word of the Lord or the Word, that came to them. May it not be, however, that as we say that this person comes to that, so the Son, the Word, of whom we are now theologizing, came to Hosea, sent to him by the Father;   location 176877

{Jn 1:1-2}
"And the Word was with God." He did not come to God, and this same word "was" is used of the Word because He was in the beginning at the same time when He was with God, neither being separated from the beginning nor being bereft of His Father. And again, neither did He come to be in the beginning after He had not been in it, nor did He come to be with God after not having been with Him. For before all time and the remotest age the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God.   . . . With God, however, He is God, just because He is with Him. And perhaps it was because he saw some such order in the Logos, that John did not place the clause "The Word was God" before the clause "The Word was with God." The series in which he places his different sentences does not prevent the force of each axiom from being separately and fully seen.   . . . One axiom is, "In the beginning was the Word," a second, "The Word was with God," and then comes, "And the Word was God." The arrangement of the sentences might be thought to indicate an order; we have first "In the beginning was the Word," then, "And the Word was with God," and thirdly, "And the Word was God," so that it might be seen that the Word being with God makes Him God.   location 176897

{Jn 1:1-2}
We next notice John's use of the article [ho] in these sentences. He does not write without care in this respect, nor is he unfamiliar with the niceties of the Greek tongue. In some cases he uses the article, and in some he omits it. . . . He adds the article to the Logos, but to the name of God he adds it sometimes only. He uses the article when the name of God refers to the uncreated cause of all things, and omits it when the Logos is named God. Does the same difference which we observe between God with the article and God without it prevail also between the Logos with it and without it? We must enquire into this. The God who is over all is God with the article, not [God] without [the article]. Likewise, the Logos is the source of that reason (logos) which dwells in every reasonable creature. However, the reason which is in each creature is not, like the former [i.e., the Son] called The Logos, par excellence.

{Trinity; Jn 17:3; Ps 50:1}
Now there are many who are sincerely concerned about religion, and who fall here into great perplexity. They are afraid that they may be proclaiming two Gods, and their fear drives them into doctrines which are false and wicked. Either they deny that the Son has a distinct nature of His own besides that of the Father, and make Him whom they call the Son to be God all but the name, or they deny the divinity of the Son, giving Him a separate existence of His own, and making His sphere of essence fall outside that of the Father, so that they are separable from each other. To such persons we have to say that [the] God on the one hand is Very God (Autotheos, God of Himself); and so the Savior says in His prayer to the Father, "That they may know You the only true God;" but that all beyond the Very God is made God by participation in His divinity, and is not to be called simply God (with the article), but rather God (without the article). And thus the First-born of all creation, who is the first to be with God, and to attract to Himself divinity, is a being of more exalted rank than the other gods beside Him, of whom God is the God, as it is written, "The God of gods, the Lord, has spoken and called the earth."   location 176903

But the archetypal image, again, of all these images is the Word of God, who was in the beginning, and who by being with God is at all times God, not possessing that of Himself, but by His being with the Father, and not continuing to be God, if we should think of this, except by remaining always in uninterrupted contemplation of the depths of the Father.   . . . To this we must add, in order to answer objections, that the reason [logos] which is in every reasonable creature occupies the same relation to the reason who was in the beginning with God— i.e, God the Word-- as God the Word occupies to God. . . . So He, the Word, is to the reason (logos) in every man. Each fills the place of a fountain—the Father is the fountain of divinity; the Son [is the fountain] of reason.   location 176927

{Deut 4:19}
Now the sun and the moon and the stars were connected, according to the accounts of men of old times, with beings who were not worthy to have the God of gods counted their God. To this opinion they were led by a passage in Deuteronomy which is somewhat as follows: "Lest when you lift up your eyes to heaven, and seest the sun and the moon and the whole host of heaven, you wander away and worship them and serve them which the Lord your God has appointed to all the peoples. But to you the Lord your God has not so given them." But how did God appoint the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven to all the nations, if He did not give them in the same way to Israel also? It was to the end that those who could not rise to the realm of intellect might be inclined by gods of sense to reflect on the nature of God, and might of their own free will connect themselves with these [heavenly bodies] and so be kept from falling away to idols and demons?   … A third class [of pagans] worship the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, wandering, it is true, from God, but with a far different and a better wandering than that of those who invoke as gods the works of men's hands, silver and gold,—works of human skill.

The same John in the Apocalypse gives Him His name [i.e. Logos] with the addition "of God," where he says: "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, . . . and His name is called Word of God." In this passage Logos is necessarily spoken of absolutely without the article, and also with the addition Logos of God; had the first not been the case (i.e., had the article been given) we might have been led to take up the meaning wrongly, and so to depart from the truth about the Logos. For if it had been called simply Logos, and had not been said to be the Logos of God, then we would not be clearly informed that the Logos is the Logos of God.   location 176991

For none of those who have some portion of righteousness and of the faculty of judgment can receive on his soul such copies and impressions of righteousness and judgment as to come short in no point of absolute righteousness and absolute justice. Similarly, no painter of a picture can communicate to the representation all the qualities of the original. This, I conceive, is the reason why David says, "Before You, shall no living being be justified." He does not say, no man, or no angel, but no living being, since even if any being partakes of life and has altogether put off mortality, not even then can he be justified in comparison of You, who are, as it were, Life itself. Nor is it possible that one who partakes of life and is therefore called living, should become Life itself, or that one who partakes of righteousness and, therefore, is called righteous should become equal to Righteousness itself.   location 177014

To those who fail to distinguish with care the different propositions of the context, the Evangelist [John] may appear to be repeating himself.

There are four axioms, or, as some call them, propositions, the fourth being "He was in the beginning with God."

{Col 1:16; Mt 12:32; Trinity; Holy Spirit}
It appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that "all things were made through Him," must necessarily assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older than He.  . . . And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated. There is a third position besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son. But on further thought one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage, "Whoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him, but whoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come."

And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God's own Son. The Only-begotten is the only one who by nature and from the beginning is a Son.

{Isa 48:16; Mt 12:32; Sin Against the Holy Spirit; Heb 2:7; Preface to Hebrews; Hebrews, Author of}
There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit. "Now the Lord has sent Me," He says, "and His Spirit," and in the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come. What is the reason of this? Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven? May it not rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them.   … When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Savior, but that the Savior takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become man. Should anyone stumble at our saying that the Savior in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death.   location 177107

but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Savior as the only one able to endure such a conflict. The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the time comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men. . . . This He did, when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the baptism. He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to bear His glory. Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him. . . . "Whomever

As for the meanings of the word "Nothing" and "Not-being," they would appear to be synonymous, for Nothing can be spoken of as Not-being, and the Not-being can be described as Nothing.  … And Mardochaeus, too, in the Esther of the Septuagint, calls the enemies of Israel "those that are not," saying, "Deliver not your scepter, O Lord, to those that are not." We may also notice how evil men, on account of their wickedness, are said not to be, from the name ascribed to God in Exodus: "For the Lord said to Moses, I am, that is My name." The good God says this with respect of us also who pray that we may be part of His congregation. The Savior praises him, saying, "None is good but one, God the Father."

The passage which declares that before God no living being shall be justified shows that in comparison with God and the righteousness that is in Him none, even of the most finished saints, will be justified. We might take a parable from another quarter and say that no candle can give light before the sun, not that the candle will not give light, only it will not when the sun outshines it. In the same way every "living" will be justified, only not before God, when it is compared with those who are below and who are in the power of darkness. To them the light of the saints will shine.

Another student, however, looking into the matter more closely and with a sounder judgment, will say that the light which shines in darkness and is not overtaken by it, is not the same as the light in which there is no darkness at all.   … But the light in which there is no darkness at all neither shines on darkness, nor is at first pursued by it, so as to prove victor and to have it recorded that it was not overtaken by its pursuer. The third designation was "the true light."

For if Jesus was in the likeness of the flesh of sin and for sin, and condemned sin by taking upon Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, then it cannot be said of Him, absolutely and directly, that there was no darkness in Him.  … And let no one suppose that we say this from any lack of piety towards the Christ of God; for as the Father alone has immortality and our Lord took upon Himself, for His love to men, the death He died for us, so to the Father alone the words apply, "In Him is no darkness," since Christ took upon Himself, for His goodwill towards men, our darknesses.

On examining the names, then, we find "Joannes" [John] to be "Joa" without the "nes." The New Testament gives Hebrew names a Greek form and treats them as Greek words; Jacob is changed into Jacobus, Symeon into Simon, and Joannes is the same as Joa. Zacharias is said to be "memory", and Elisabeth "oath of my God," or "strength of my God." John then came into the world from grace of God (=Joa=Joannes), and his parents were Memory (about God) and the Oath of our God,   location 177532

{Lk 24:44; 1 Pet 1:10-12; Heb 1:1-2}
there are many causes which may lead men to believe, since men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able to provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their minds to open to the truth that God, who is over all, has taken on Himself human nature. It is manifest to all, how some are brought by the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ. They are astounded at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place of His birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching, His working of wonderful works, and His human passion brought to a close by His resurrection.

We must notice, too, that Christ's stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of Christ's own time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with the lapse of years and began to be regarded as mythical. Greater evidential value than that of the miracles then performed attaches to the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the prophecy of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any doubt on the former. The prophetic testimonies do not declare merely the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means the case that they teach this and nothing else. Rather, they also teach a great deal of theology. The relation of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be learned not less from what the prophets announce about Christ, than from the Apostles   location 177549

Now everyone who bears witness to the truth, whether he support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may properly be called a witness (martyr); but it has come to be the custom of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration of those who have contended to the death for truth and valor, to keep the name of martyr more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of godliness by shedding their blood for it. The Savior gives the name of martyr to everyone who bears witness to the truth He declares.

{Jn 1:15-18}
Accordingly John [the Baptist] came to bear witness of the light, and in his witness-bearing he cried, saying, "He that comes after me exists before me; for He was before me; for of His fullness we have all received and grace for grace, for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him." This whole speech is from the mouth of the Baptist bearing witness to the Christ. Some take it otherwise, and consider that the words from "for of His fullness" to "He has declared Him" are from the writer, John the Apostle. The true state of the case is that John's [i.e., the Baptist's] first testimony begins, as we said before, "He that comes after me," and ends, "He has declared Him,"   location 177580

Consider if, since the heart is in the middle of the whole body, and the ruling principle in the heart, the saying, "There stands One among you whom you know not," can be understood of the reason which is in every man.

The Apostles are not unaware that in some things they give offence, and that in some respects their sophistication is defective.

By "earthen vessels" we understand the humble diction of the Scriptures, which the Greek might so readily be led to despise, and in which the excellency of God's power appears so clearly. The mystery of the truth and the power of the things said were not hindered by the humble diction from travelling to the ends of the earth, nor from subduing to the word of Christ, not only the foolish things of the
world, but sometimes its wise things, too.  location 177646

And Peter, on whom the Church of Christ is built, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail left only one epistle of acknowledged genuineness. Suppose we allow that he left a second; for this is doubtful. What are we to say of him who leaned on Jesus' breast, namely, John, who left one Gospel, though confessing that he could make so many that the world would not contain them? But he wrote also the Apocalypse, being commanded to be silent and not to write the voices of the seven thunders. But he also left an epistle of very few lines.

{Lk 24:44; Jn 5:39; Lk 24:27; Ps 40:7; Heb 10:7; Lk 24:44}
Christ is written about even in the Pentateuch; He is spoken of in each of the Prophets, and in the Psalms, and, in a word, as the Savior Himself says, in all the Scriptures. He refers us to them all, when He says: "Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and these are they which testify of Me." And if He refers us to the Scriptures as testifying of Him, it is not to one that He sends us, to the exclusion of another, but to all that speak of Him, those which, in the Psalms, He calls the chapter of the book, saying, "In the chapter of the book it is written of Me." If anyone proposes to take these words, "In the chapter of the book it is written of Me," literally, and to apply them to this or that special passage where Christ is spoken of, let him tell us on what principle he warrants his preference for one book over another.   . . .

For the book here spoken of means the whole of Scripture; and it is written within (lit. in front), on account of the meaning which is obvious, and on the back, on account of its remoter and spiritual sense. Observe, in addition to this, if a proof that the sacred writings are one book, and those of an opposite character many, may not be found in the fact that there is one book of the living from which those who have proved unworthy to be in it are blotted out, as it is written: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living," while of those who are to undergo the judgment, there are books in the plural, as Daniel says: "The judgment was set, and the books were opened."   location 177720

But Moses also bears witness to the unity of the sacred book, when he says: "If You forgive the people their sins, forgive, but if not, then wipe me out of the book which You have written." The passage in Isaiah, too, I read in the same way. It is not peculiar to his prophecy that the words of the book should be sealed, and should neither be read by him who does not know letters, because he is ignorant of letters, nor by him who is learned, because the book is sealed. This is true of every writing, forevery written work needs the reason (Logos) which closed it to open it. "He shall shut, and none shall open," and when He opens no one can cast doubt on the interpretation He brings. Hence it is said that He shall open and no man shall shut.  . . . I infer a similar lesson from the book spoken of in Ezekiel, in which was written lamentation, and a song, and woe. For the whole book is full of the woe of the lost, and the song of the saved, and the lamentation of those between these two.   . . . And John, too, when he speaks of his eating the one roll, in which both front and back were written on, means the whole of Scripture, one book which is, at first, most sweet when one begins, as it were, to chew it, but bitter in the revelation of himself which it makes to the conscience of each one who knows it. I will add to the proof of this an apostolic saying   . . . The Apostle says: "According to my Gospel in Christ Jesus;" he does not speak of Gospels in the plural, and, hence, they argue that as the Apostle only speaks of one Gospel in the singular, there was only one in existence. But they fail to see that, as He is one of whom all the evangelists write, so the Gospel, though written by several hands, is, in effect, one. And, in fact, the Gospel, though written by four, is one. From these considerations, then, we learn what the one book is, and what the many books,   location 177737

Does he not teach us that he was before Abraham, and that Abraham rejoiced and was glad to see his day? The words "Of his fullness all we received," and "Grace for grace," show, as we have already made clear, that the prophets also received their gift from the fullness of Christ and received a second grace in place of that they had before; for they also, led by the Spirit, advanced from the introduction they had in types to the vision of truth. Hence not all the prophets, but many of them, desired to see the things, which the Apostles saw.   . . .
of His fullness both I [John the Baptist] and the prophets before me received the more divine prophetic grace instead of the grace we received at His hands before in respect of our election. That is why I say, "He exists before me, for He was before me," because we know what we have received from His fullness; namely, that the law was given through Moses, not by Moses, while grace and truth not only were given but came into existence through Jesus Christ.

{Jn 1:15-16}
Now the true soldiers of Christ must always be prepared to do battle for the truth, and must never, so far as lies with them, allow false convictions to creep in. We must not, therefore, neglect this matter. Some say that John's [the Baptist's] earlier testimony to Christ is to be found in the words, "He who comes after me exists before me, for He was before me," and that the words, "For of His fullness we all received, and grace for grace," are in the mouth of John the apostle. Now, we must show this exposition to be a forced one, and one which does violence to the context. It is rather a strong proceeding to suppose the speech of the Baptist to be so suddenly and, as it were, inopportunely interrupted by that of the apostle, and it is quite apparent to anyone who can judge, in whatever small degree, of a context, that the speech goes on continuously after the words, "This is He of whom I spoke, He that comes after me exists before me, for He was before me." The Baptist brings a proof that Jesus existed before him because He was before him, since He is the first-born of all creation; he says, "For of His fullness all we received." That is the reason why he says, "He exists before me, for He was before me." [In other words: "This is how I know that He is first and in higher honor with the Father, since of His fullness both I and the prophets before me received the more divine prophetic grace, instead of the grace we received at His hands before in respect of our choosing.

Those, on the contrary, who are sent from the Pharisees assail the Baptist, as it were, with arrogant and unsympathetic words: "Why then baptize you if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?"

{Jn 1:20-22}
To this we may say that [John the Baptist] probably discerned in the question of the priests and Levites a cautious reverence, which led them to hint the idea in their minds that he who was baptizing might be the Christ, but withheld them from openly saying so, which might have been presumptuous. He quite naturally, therefore, proceeds in the first place to remove any false impressions they might have taken up about him, and declares publicly the true state of the matter, "I am not the Christ." Their second question, and also their third, show that they had conceived some such surmise about him. They supposed that he might be that second in honor to whom their hopes pointed, namely, Elijah, who held with them the next position after Christ; and so when John had answered, "I am not the Christ," they asked, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he said, "I am not." They wish to know, in the third place, if he is the prophet, and on his answer, "No," they have no longer any name to give the personage whose advent they expected, and they say, "Who are you, then, that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?" Their meaning is: "You are not, you say, any of those personages whose advent Israel hopes and expects, and who you are, to baptize as you do, we do not know; tell us, therefore, so that we may report to those who sent us to get light upon this point." We add, as it has some bearing on the context, that the people were moved by the thought that the period of Christ's advent was near. It was in a manner imminent in the years from the birth of Jesus and a little before, down to the publication of the preaching. Hence it was, in all likelihood, that as the scribes and lawyers had deduced the time from Holy Scripture and were expecting the Coming One, the idea was taken up by Theudas, who came forward as the Messiah and brought together a considerable multitude, and after him by the famous Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing. Thus the coming of the Messiah was more warmly expected and discussed, and it was natural enough for the Jews to send priests and Levites from Jerusalem to John, to ask him, "Who are you?" and learn if he professed to be the Christ.    location 177959

Now it can be shown from thousands of texts that the spirit is a different thing from the soul, and that what is called the power is a different thing from both the soul and the spirit.  . . . "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets," and "The spirit of Elijah rested upon Elisha." Thus, it is said, there is nothing absurd in supposing that John, "in the spirit and power of Elijah," turned the hearts of the fathers to the children, and that it was on account of this spirit that he was called "Elijah who was to come."

And to reinforce this view it may be argued that if the God of the universe identified Himself with His saints to such an extent as to be called the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, much more might the Holy Spirit so identify Himself with the prophets as to be called their Spirit, so that when the Spirit is spoken of it might be the Spirit of Elijah or the Spirit of Isaiah.   location 177989

I do not know how the Hebrews came to tell about Phinehas, son of Eleazar, who admittedly prolonged his life to the time of many of the judges, as we read in the Book of Judges, to tell about him what I now mention. They say that he was Elijah, because he had been promised immortality (in Numbers), on account of the covenant of peace granted to him because he was jealous with a divine jealousy, and in a passion of anger pierced the Midianitish woman and the Israelite, and stayed the wrath of God as it is called, as it is written, "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them." No wonder, then, if those who conceived Phinehas and Elijah to be the same person, whether they judged soundly in this or not, for that is not now the question, considered John and Jesus also to be the same.

If, then, he is said by the Savior to be not only a prophet but "more than a prophet," how is it that when the priests and Levites come and ask him, "Are you the Prophet?" he answers No! On this we must remark that it is not the same thing to say, "Are you the Prophet?" and "Are you a prophet?" The distinction between the two expressions has already been observed, when we asked what was the difference between the God and God, and between the Logos and Logos. Now it is written in Deuteronomy, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like me; Him shall you hear, and it shall be that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among His people." There was, therefore, an expectation of one particular prophet having a resemblance to Moses in mediating between God and the people and receiving a new covenant from God to give to those who accepted his teaching; and in the case of each of the prophets, the people of Israel recognized that he was not the person of whom Moses spoke. As, then, they doubted about John, whether he were not the Christ, so they doubted whether he could not be the prophet. And there is no wonder that those who doubted about John whether he were the Christ, did not understand that the Christ and the prophet are the same person; their doubt as to John necessarily implied that they were not clear on this point.

For John's voice [phone] points to that word [logos] and demonstrates it. It is therefore a very appropriate punishment that falls on Zacharias on his saying to the angel, "Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years." Because of his lack of faith with regard to the birth of the Voice [John the Baptist], he is himself deprived of his voice,   location 178087

{Jn 1:7; Mk 1:1-3; Jn 1:23; Isa 40:3; Mal 3:1; Mt 11:10; Jn 7:37; Ex 14:15; Ps 3:4}
John came for a witness; he was a man sent from God to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe; he was that voice, then, we are to understand, which alone was fitted worthily to announce the Logos. We shall understand this aright if we call to mind what was adduced in our exposition of the texts: "That all might believe through Him," and "This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send My messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you." There is fitness, too, in his being said to be the voice, not of one saying in the wilderness, but of one crying in the wilderness. He who cries, "Prepare you the way of the Lord," also says it; but he might say it without crying it. But he cries and shouts it, that even those may hear who are at a distance from the speaker, and that even the deaf may understand the greatness of the tidings, since it is announced in a loud voice; and he thus brings help, both to those who have departed from God and to those who have lost the acuteness of their hearing. This, too, was the reason why "Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink." Hence, too, "John bears witness of Him, and cried, saying," "Hence also God commands Isaiah to cry, with the voice of one saying, Cry. And I said, What shall I cry?" The physical voice we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not lift up any great cry or shout, God will yet hear us. He says to Moses, "Why cry unto Me?" when Moses had not cried audibly at all. It is not recorded in Exodus that he did so; but Moses had cried mightily to God in prayer with that voice which is heard by God alone. Hence David also says, "With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me." And one who cries in the desert has need of a voice, that the soul which is deprived of God and deserted of truth—and what more dreadful desert is there than a soul deserted of God and of all virtue, since it still goes crookedly and needs instruction—may be exhorted to make straight the way of the Lord.

{Mt 7:13-14; Mt 11:12; Ex 3:5; Jn 14:6}
This way is narrow, indeed, for the many cannot bear to walk in it and are lovers of their flesh; but it is also hard-pressed by those who use violence [Mt 11:12] to walk in it, for it is not called afflicting, but afflicted [thlibo]. For that way which is a living way, and
feels the qualities of those who tread it, is pressed and afflicted, when he travels on it who has not taken off his shoes from his feet [Ex 3:5], nor truly realized that the place on which he stands, indeed treads, is holy ground. And it will lead to Him who is the life, and who says, "I am the life." For the Savior, in whom all virtues are combined, has many aspects. To him who, though by no means near the end, is yet advancing, He is the way; to him who has put off all that is dead He is the life. He who travels on this way is told to take nothing with him on it, since it provides bread and all that is necessary for life, enemies are powerless on it, and he needs no staff, and since it is holy, he needs no shoes.   location 178121

Again, not Heracleon alone, but, so far as I am informed, all those who diverge from our views, as if they had not been able to deal with a trifling ambiguity and to draw the proper distinction, suppose John to be greater than both Elijah and all the prophets. The words are, "Of those born of women there is none greater than John;" but this admits of two meanings: that John is greater than they all, or again, that some of them are equal to him. For though many of the prophets were equal to him, still it might be true in respect of the favor bestowed on him, that none of them was greater than he.

{Lk 3:9; Heb 4:12}
when he sees many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, clearly without  having the fruits of repentance, and Pharisaically boasting in themselves that they had Abraham for their father. . . . he says to them most appropriately, "Already is the axe laid to the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire." This is as much as to say to them: "Since you have come to baptism without having done fruits fitting for repentance, you are a tree that does not bring forth good fruit and which has to be cut down by the most sharp and piercing axe of the Logos, which is living and powerful and sharper than every two-edged sword."   location 178189

How have you come to believe that "Elijah who is to come" will baptize? Elijah did not baptize the logs upon the altar in the times of Ahab, though they needed such a bath to be burned up, what time the Lord appeared in fire. [1 Kings 18] No, he commands the priests to do this for him, and that not only once; for he says, "Do it a second time," upon which they did it a second time, and "Do it a third time," and they did it a third time. If, then, he did not at that time himself baptize but left the work to others, how was he to baptize at the time spoken of by Malachi?   location 178203

{Jn 1:23; Mk 1:1-3}
The words, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord," are placed in the mouth of [John] the Baptist by [the] John who was an apostle.  . . . 
In Mark, on the other hand, the same words are recorded at the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the Scripture of Isaiah, as thus: "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, 'Behold, I send My messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.'"   location 178217

{Jn 1:23; Isa 40:3; Mal 3:1; Mt 3:7; Mk 1:5; Lk 3:5-7; Isa 40:4-5}

Now the words, "Make straight the way of the Lord," added by John, are not found in the prophet [Isaiah]. Perhaps John was seeking to compress the "Prepare you the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God," and so he wrote, "Make straight the way of the Lord." On the other hand, Mark combined two prophecies spoken by two different prophets in different places, and made one prophecy out of them. . .. The words, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness," are written immediately after the narrative of Hezekiah's recovery from his sickness, while the words, "Behold I send My messenger before your face," are written by Malachi. What John does here, abbreviating the text he quotes, we find done by Mark also at another point. For while the words of the prophet are, "Prepare you the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God," Mark writes, "Prepare you the way of the Lord, make His paths straight." And John practices a similar abbreviation in the text, "Behold I send My messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you," when he does not add the words "before you," as in the original.   . . . A further circumstance which we must mention is that both Matthew and Mark state that, in the one case, all Jerusalem and all Judaea, and the whole region round about Jordan, in the other, the whole land of Judaea and all they of Jerusalem, were baptized, confessing their sins; but when Matthew introduces the Pharisees and Sadducees as coming to the baptism, he does not say that they confessed their sins, and this might very likely and very naturally be the reason why they were addressed as "offspring of vipers."   . . . Luke, however, added the continuation of the prophecy: "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall become straight." . . . He writes, like Mark, "Make His ways straight;" curtailing, as we saw before, the text, "Make straight the ways of our God." In the phrase, "And all the crooked shall become straight," he leaves out the "all," and the word "straight" he converts from a plural into a singular. Instead of the phrase, moreover, "The rough land into a plain," he gives, "The rough ways into smooth ways," and he leaves out "And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed," and gives what follows, "And all flesh shall see the salvation of God." These observations are of use as showing how the evangelists are accustomed to abbreviate the sayings of the prophets.   location 178248   
. . .
With Luke, on the contrary, these words were addressed to the multitudes who came out to be baptized by John, and there were not two divisions of those who were baptized, as we found in Matthew. But Matthew, as the careful observer will see, does not speak of the multitudes in the way of praise, and he probably means the Baptist's address, "Offspring of vipers, etc.," to be understood as addressed to them also.   . . .
Another point is, that to the Pharisees and Sadducees he says, "Bring forth a fruit," in the singular, "worthy of repentance," but to the multitudes he uses the plural, "Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance."   location 178258   
. . .
And observe how it is said to the Pharisees, according to the word of the prophet, "You have eaten false fruit," and they have false fruit,—"Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire," while to the multitudes which do not bear fruit at all, "Every tree which does not bring forth fruit is hewn down." For that which has no fruit at all has not good fruit, and, therefore, it is worthy to be hewn down. But that which bears fruit, but has by no means good fruit, whence it also calls for the axe to lay it low.   location 178265   
Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of John, bk. 6, ch. 14.

{Mt 3:7}
The Pharisees, addressed by John, as we saw before, with his "Offspring of vipers," etc., came to the baptism, without believing in him, probably because they feared the multitudes, and, with their accustomed hypocrisy towards them, deemed it right to undergo the washing, so as not to appear hostile to those who did so. Their belief was, then, that he derived his baptism from men.   location 178294

{Jn 1:25-27}
[John the Baptist was] asked, "Why baptize then, if You are not the Christ?" And what other answer could be given to this than to show that his baptism was in its nature a bodily thing? I, he says, "baptize with water;" this is his answer to, "Why do you baptize?" And to the second part of their question, "If You are not the Christ," he answers by exalting the superior nature of Christ, that He has such virtue as to be invisible in His deity, though present to every man and extending over the whole universe. This is what is indicated in the words, "There stands one among you." The Pharisees, moreover, though expecting the advent of Christ, understood nothing in [the Messiah] of such a nature as John speaks of; they believed [the Messiah] to be simply a perfect and holy man. John, therefore, rebukes their ignorance of Christ's superiority, and adds to the words, "There stands one among you," the clause, "whom you know not." And, lest anyone should suppose the invisible One who extends to every man, or, indeed, to the whole world, to be a different person from Him who became man, and appeared upon the earth and conversed with men, he adds to the words, "There stands one among you whom you know not," the further words, "Who comes after me," that is, He who is to be manifested after me. By whose surpassing excellence he well understood that his own nature was far surpassed, though some doubted whether he might be the Christ; and, therefore, desiring to show how far he is from attaining to the greatness of the Christ, that no one should think of him beyond what he sees or hears of him, he goes on: "The latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose."

{Mt 3:2; Baptism; Titus 3:5; Mt 28:19-20}
It is to be observed that while the four [Gospels] represent John as declaring himself to have come to baptize with water, Matthew alone adds the words "to repentance," teaching that the benefit of baptism is connected with the intention of the baptized person. To him who repents, it is salutary. However, to him who comes to it without repentance, it will turn to greater condemnation.   . . . so the washing with water which is symbolic of the soul cleansing herself from every stain of wickedness, is no less in itself to him who yields himself to the divine power of the invocation of the Adorable Trinity, the beginning and source of divine gifts;   location 178351

We next remark in passing that the baptism of John was inferior to the baptism of Jesus which was given through His disciples.

Regeneration did not take place with John, but with Jesus through His disciples it does so. And what is called the laver of regeneration takes place with renewal of the Spirit; for the Spirit now comes in addition since it comes from God and is over and above the water and does not come to all after the water.   location 178356

"These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing." I am aware of the reading which is found in almost all the copies, "These things were done in Bethany." This appears, moreover, to have been the reading at an earlier time; and in Heracleon we read "Bethany." I am convinced, however, that we should not read "Bethany," but "Bethabara." I have visited the places to enquire as to the footsteps of Jesus and His disciples, and of the prophets. Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us, was the town of Lazarus, and of Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, and the river Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia distant from it. Nor is there any other place of the same name in the neighborhood of the Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is pointed out on the banks of the Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized there.   location 178467

But in a few copies we have found, "into the country of the Gadarenes;" and, on this reading, it is to be stated that Gadara is a town of Judaea, in the neighborhood of which are the well-known hot springs, and that there is no lake there with overhanging banks, nor any sea. But Gergesa, from which the name Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the neighborhood of the lake now called Tiberias, and on the edge of it there is a steep place abutting on the lake, from which it is pointed out that the swine were cast down by the demons.   location 178482

The same inaccuracy with regard to proper names is also to be observed in many passages of the law and the prophets, as we have been at pains to learn from the Hebrews, comparing our own copies with theirs which have the confirmation of the versions, never subjected to corruption, of Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus.   . . . One of the sons of Levi, the first, is called Geson in most copies, instead of Gerson. His name is the same as that of the first-born of Moses; it was given appropriately in each case, both children being born, because of the sojourn in Egypt, in a strange land. The second son of Judah, again, has with us the name Annan, but with the Hebrews Onan, "their labor."   . . .

We hear our Lord Jesus saying to the children of Israel, "Come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God. Hereby you shall know that the living God is in you" [Josh. 3:9,10]. For when we are baptized to Jesus, we know that the living God is in us. And, in the former case, they kept the Passover in Egypt, and then began their journey, but with Joshua, after crossing Jordan on the tenth day of the first month they pitched their camp in Galgala; Josh 5:9 [LXX] for a sheep had to be procured before invitations could be issued to the banquet after Joshua's baptism. Then the children of Israel, since the children of those who came out of Egypt had not received circumcision, were circumcised by Joshua with a very sharp stone; the Lord declares that He takes away the reproach of Egypt on the day of Joshua's baptism, when Joshua purified the children of Israel. For it is written: "And the Lord said to Joshua, the son of Nun, This day have I taken away the reproach of Egypt from off you." Then the children of Israel kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, with much greater gladness than in Egypt, for they ate unleavened bread from the wheat of the holy land, and fresh food [that was] better than manna.   . . .

{2 Kings 2:9-15; Baptism}
Another point which we must not fail to notice is that when Elijah was about to be taken up in a whirlwind, as if to heaven, he took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the water, which was divided hither and thither, and they went over both of them, that is, he and Elisha. His baptism in the Jordan made him fitter to be taken up, for, as we showed before, Paul gives the name of baptism to such a remarkable passage through the water [such as at the Red Sea]. And through this same Jordan, Elisha receives, through Elijah, the gift he desired, saying, "Let a double portion of your spirit be upon me." What enabled him to receive this gift of the spirit of Elijah was, perhaps, that he had passed through Jordan twice, once with Elijah, and the second time, when, after receiving the mantle of Elijah, he smote the water and said, "Where is the God of Elijah, even He? And he smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither."   location 178564

28. Naaman the Syrian and the Jordan. No Other Stream Has the Same Healing Power.
Should anyone object to the expression "He smote the water," on account of the conclusion we arrived at above with respect to the Jordan, that it is a type of the Word who descended for us 374 our descending, we rejoin that with the Apostle the rock is plainly said to be Christ, and that it is smitten twice with the rod, so that the people may drink of the spiritual rock which follows them [i.e., the two Testaments?]. The "smiting" in this new difficulty is that of those who are fond of suggesting something that contradicts the conclusion even before they have learned what the question is which is in hand. From such God sets us free, since, on the one hand, He gives us to drink when we are thirsty, and on the other He prepares for us, in the immense and trackless deep, a road to pass over, namely, by the dividing of His Word, since it is by the Reason which distinguishes (divides) that most things are made plain to us. But that we may receive the right interpretation about this Jordan, so good to drink, so full of grace, it may be of use to compare the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian from his leprosy, and what is said of the rivers of religion of the enemies of Israel. location 178573

Jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter should receive attention; it was by vowing it that he conquered the children of Ammon, and the victim approved his vow, for when her father said, "I have opened my mouth unto the Lord against you," she answered, "If you have opened your mouth unto the Lord against me, do that which you have vowed."

Then we shall say, "Great are the judgments of God, and hard to be described; for this cause untutored souls have gone astray."   . . .
Among the Gentiles, too, it is recorded that many a one, when pestilential disease broke out in his country, offered himself a victim for the public good. That this was the case the faithful Clement [of Rome] assumes, on the faith of the narratives, to whom Paul bears witness when he says, "With Clement also, and the others, my fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life." If there is anything in these narratives that appears incongruous to one who is minded to complain about mysteries revealed to a few, the same difficulty attaches to the office that was laid on the martyrs, for it was God's will that we should rather endure all the dreadful reproaches connected with confessing Him as God, than escape for a short time from such sufferings (which men count evil) by allowing ourselves by our words to conform to the will of the enemies of the truth.   location 178700   
. . .
We are, therefore, led to believe that the powers of evil do suffer defeat by the death of the holy martyrs. It is as if their patience, their confession, even unto death, and their zeal for piety blunted the edge of the onset of evil powers against the sufferer,   location 178705

{1 Tim 4:10; Col 2:14-15; Christus Victor; Atonement; Rom 8:37; Ps 72:12; Rev 7:9}
He is the Savior of all men, especially of them that believe, who blotted out the written bond that was against us by His own blood, and took it out of the way, so that not even a trace, not even of our blotted-out sins, might still be found, and nailed it to His cross; who having put off from Himself the principalities and powers, made a show of them openly, triumphing over them by His cross. And we are taught to rejoice when we suffer afflictions in the world, knowing the ground of our rejoicing to be this, that the world has been conquered and has manifestly been subjected to its conqueror. Hence all the nations [people groups?], released from their former rulers, serve Him, because He4973 saved the poor from his tyrant by His own passion, and the needy who had no helper. This Savior, then, having humbled the calumniator by humbling Himself, abides with the visible sun before His illustrious church, metaphorically called the moon, from generation to generation. And having by His passion destroyed His enemies, He who is strong in battle and a mighty Lord4974 required after His mighty deeds a purification which could only be given Him by His Father alone.

He who is strong in battle and a mighty Lord4974 required after His mighty deeds a purification which could only be given Him by His Father alone; and this is why He forbids Mary to touch Him, saying,4975 "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father; but go and tell My disciples, I go to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God." And when He comes, loaded with victory and with trophies, with His body which has risen from the dead,—for what other meaning can we see in the words, "I am not yet ascended to My Father," and "I go unto My Father,"—then there are certain powers which say, "Who is this that comes from Edom, red garments from Bosor; this that is beautiful?"4976 Then those who escort Him say to those that are upon the heavenly gates,4977 "Lift up your gates, you rulers, and be you lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the king of glory shall come in." But they ask again, seeing as it were His right hand red with blood and His whole person covered with the marks of His valour, "Why are Your garments red, and Your clothes like the treading of the full wine vat when it is trodden?" And to this He answers, "I have crushed them." For this cause He had need to wash "His robe in wine, and His 379 garment in the blood of the grape."4978 For when He had taken up our infirmities and carried our diseases, and had borne the sin of the whole world, and had conferred blessings on so many, then, perhaps, He received that baptism which is greater than any that could ever be conceived among men, and of which I think He speaks when He says,4979 "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be accomplished?" I enquire here with boldness and I challenge the ideas put forward by most writers. They say that the greatest baptism, beyond which no greater can be conceived, is His passion. But if this be so, why should He say to Mary after it, "Touch me not"? He should rather have offered Himself to her touch, when by His passion He had received His perfect baptism. But if it was the case, as we said before, that after all His deeds of valour done against His enemies, He had need to wash "His robe in wine, His garment in the blood of the grape," then He was on His way up to the husbandman of the true vine, the Father, so that having washed there and after having gone up on high, He might lead captivity captive and come down bearing manifold gifts—the tongues, as of fire, which were divided to the Apostles, and the holy angels which are to be present with them in each action and to deliver them. For before these economies they were not yet cleansed and angels could not dwell with them, for they too perhaps do not desire to be with those who have not prepared themselves nor been cleansed by Jesus. For it was of Jesus' benignity alone that He ate and drank with publicans and sinners, and suffered the penitent woman who was a sinner to wash His feet with her tears, and went down even to death for the ungodly, not grasping at equality with God, and emptied Himself, assuming the form of a servant. And in accomplishing all this He fulfils rather the will of the Father who gave Him up for sinners than His own. For the Father is good, but the Savior is the image of His goodness; and doing good to the world in all things, since God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, which formerly for its wickedness was all enemy to Him, location 178726

{Ps 110:1; 1 Cor 15:26}
Since God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, which formerly for its wickedness was all enemy to Him, He accomplishes His good deeds in order and succession, and does not all at once take all His enemies for His footstool. For the Father says to Him, to the Lord of us all,4980 "Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies the footstool of Your feet." And this goes on till the last enemy, Death, is overcome by Him. And if we consider what is meant by this subjection to Christ and find an explanation of this mainly from the saying,4981 "When all things shall have been put under Him, then shall the Son Himself be subjected to Him who put all things under Him," then we shall see how the conception agrees with the goodness of the God of all, since it is that of the Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world.

He who has allowed wickedness to establish itself so deeply in his soul as to be a ground full of thorns, he must be cut down by the quick and powerful word of God, which is sharper than a two-edged sword, and which is more caustic than any fire. To such a soul that fire must be sent which finds out thorns, and by its divine virtue stands where they are and does not also burn up the threshing-floors or standing corn. But of the Lamb which takes away the sin of the world and begins to do so by His own death there are several ways, some of which are capable of being clearly understood by most, but others are concealed from most, and are known to those only who are worthy of divine wisdom. . . . This has brought us to see that God convicts some by His wrath and chastens them by His anger, since His love to men is so great that He will not leave any without conviction 380 and chastening; so that we should do what in us lies to be spared such conviction and such chastening by the sorest trials.

38. The World, of Which the Sin is Taken Away, is Said to Be the Church. Reasons for Not Agreeing with This Opinion. 
The reader will do well to consider what was said above and illustrated from various quarters on the question what is meant in Scripture by the word "world"; and I think it proper to repeat this. I am aware that a certain scholar understands by the world the Church alone, since the Church is the adornment of the world,4983 and is said to be the light of the world. "You," he says,4984 "are the light of the world." Now, the adornment of the world is the Church, Christ being her adornment, who is the first light of the world. We must consider if Christ is said to be the light of the same world as His disciples. When Christ is the light of the world, perhaps it is meant that He is the light of the Church, but when His disciples are the light of the world, perhaps they are the light of others who call on the Lord, others in addition to the Church, as Paul says on this point in the beginning of his first Epistle to the Corinthians, where he writes, "To the Church of God, with all who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Should anyone consider that the Church is called the light of the world, meaning thereby of the rest of the race of men, including unbelievers, this may be true if the assertion is taken prophetically and theologically; but if it is to be taken of the present, we remind him that the light of a thing illuminates that thing, and would ask him to show how the remainder of the race is illuminated by the Church's presence in the world. If those who hold the view in question cannot show this, then let them consider if our interpretation is not a sound one, that the light is the Church, and the world those others who call on the Name. The words which follow the above in Matthew will point out to the careful inquirer the proper interpretation. "You," it is said, "are the salt of the earth," the rest of mankind being conceived as the earth, and believers are their salt; it is because they believe that the earth is preserved. For the end will come if the salt loses its aroma, and ceases to salt and preserve the earth, since it is clear that if iniquity is multiplied and love waxes cold upon the earth,4985 as the Savior Himself uttered an expression of doubt as to those who would witness His coming, saying,4986 "When the Son of man comes, shall He find faith upon the earth?" then the end of the age will come. location 178784

{Jn 1:29; 1 Jn 2:1-2; 1 Tim 4:10}
Supposing, then, the Church to be called the world, since the Savior's light shines on it—we have to ask in connection with the text, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world," whether the world here is to be taken intellectually of the Church, and the taking away of sin is limited to the Church. In that case what are we to make of the saying of the same disciple [John] with regard to the Savior, as the propitiation for sin? "If any man sin," we read, "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world?" Paul's words appear to me to be to the same effect, when he says, "Who is the Savior of all men, especially of the faithful."   location 178789

"After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples, and there they abode not many days." (Jn 2:12) The other three Evangelists say that the Lord, after His conflict with the devil, departed into Galilee. Matthew and Luke represent that he was first at Nazara, and then left them and came and dwelt in Capernaum. Matthew and Mark also state a certain reason why He departed thither, namely, that He had heard that John was cast into prison.  … "But when He heard that John was delivered up, He departed into Galilee, and leaving Nazareth He came and dwelt at Capernaum on the seashore in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali." that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;" and after the quotation from Isaiah: "From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Mark has the following:4992 "And He was in the desert forty days and forty nights tempted by Satan, and He was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto Him."  … 
Mark writes: "And He entered into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath He was teaching in the synagogue." … Then Luke gives what He said at Nazara, and how those in the synagogue were enraged at Him and cast Him out of the city and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their cities were built, to cast Him down headlong, and how going through the midst of them the Lord went His way; and with this he connects the statement, "And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath day."   location 178832   
[2. The Discrepancy Between John and the First Three Gospels at This Part of the Narrative, Literally Read, the Narratives Cannot Be Harmonized: They Must Be Interpreted Spiritually.]
 The truth of these matters must lie in that which is seen by the mind. If the discrepancy between the Gospels is not solved, we must give up our trust in the Gospels, as being true and written by a divine spirit, or as records worthy of credence, for both these characters are held to belong to these works. Those who accept the four Gospels, and who do not consider that their apparent discrepancy is to be solved anagogically (by mystical interpretation), will have to clear up the difficulty, raised above, about the forty days of the temptation, a period for which no room can be found in any way in John's narrative; and they will also have to tell us when it was that the Lord came to Capernaum. If it was after the six days of the period of His baptism, the sixth being that of the marriage at Cana of Galilee, then it is clear that the temptation never took place, and that He never was at Nazara, and that John was not yet delivered up.

{Harmony of the Gospels}
In the case I have supposed where the historians desire to teach us by an image what they have seen in their mind, their meaning would be found, if the four were wise, to exhibit no disagreement; and we must understand that with the four Evangelists it is not otherwise. They made full use for their purpose of things done by Jesus in the exercise of His wonderful and extraordinary power; they use in the same way His sayings, and in some places they tack on to their writing, with language apparently implying things of sense, things made manifest to them in a purely intellectual way. I do not condemn them if they even sometimes dealt freely with things which to the eye of history happened differently, and changed them so as to subserve the mystical aims they had in view; so as to speak of a thing which happened in a certain place, as if it had happened in another, or of what took place at a certain time, as if it had taken place at another time, and to introduce into what was spoken in a certain way some changes of their own. They proposed to speak the truth where it was possible both materially and spiritually, and where this was not possible it was their intention to prefer the spiritual to the material. The spiritual truth was often preserved, as one might say, in the material falsehood.

{Jacob; Gen 27:21-22}
The spiritual truth was often preserved, as one might say, in the material falsehood. As, for example, we might judge of the story of Jacob and Esau.4997 Jacob says to Isaac, "I am Esau thy firstborn son," and spiritually he spoke the truth, for he already partook of the rights of the first-born, which were perishing in his brother, and clothing himself with the goatskins he assumed the outward semblance of Esau, and was Esau all but the voice praising God, so that Esau might afterward find a place to receive a blessing. For if Jacob had not been blessed as Esau, neither would Esau perhaps have been able to receive a blessing of his own. 4997 Gen. xxvii.

{Rom 1:8; Phil 2:3; Marcion; Gnostics; Rom 5:19; Rom 5:15}
Statements which are verbally contrary to each other, are made about our Lord, namely, that He was descended from David and that He was not descended from David. The statement is true, "He was descended from David," as the Apostle says,4998 "born of the seed of David according to the flesh," if we apply this to the bodily part of Him; but the self-same 384 statement is untrue if we understand His being born of the seed of David of His diviner power; for He was declared to be the Son of God with power. And for this reason too, perhaps, the sacred prophecies speak of Him now as a servant, and now as a Son. They call Him a servant on account of the form of a servant which he wore, and because He was of the seed of David, but they call Him the Son of God according to His character as first-born. Thus it is true to call Him man and to call Him not man; man, because He was capable of death; not man, on account of His being diviner than man. Marcion, I suppose, took sound words in a wrong sense, when he rejected His birth from Mary, and declared that as to His divine nature He was not born of Mary, and hence made bold to delete from the Gospel the passages which have this effect. And a like fate seems to have overtaken those who make away with His humanity and receive His deity alone; and also those opposites of these who cancel His deity and confess Him as a man to be a holy man, and the most righteous of all men. And those who hold the doctrine of Dokesis, not remembering that He humbled Himself even unto death4999 and became obedient even to the cross, but only imagining in Him the absence of suffering, the superiority to all such accidents, they do what they can to deprive us of the man who is more just than all men, and are left with a figure which cannot save them, for as by one man came death, so also by one man is the justification of life. We could not have received such benefit as we have from the Logos had He not assumed the man, had He remained such as He was from the beginning with God the Father, and had He not taken up man, the first man of all, the man more precious than all others, purer than all others and capable of receiving Him. But after that man we also shall be able to receive Him, to receive Him so great and of such nature as He was, if we prepare a place in proportion to Him in our soul. So much I have said of the apparent discrepancies in the Gospels, and of my desire to have them treated in the way of spiritual interpretation.  4998 Rom. i. 3. 4999 Philipp. ii. 8.

Of the carnal one are the words, "Not what I would that do I practise, but what I hate that do I."   …

{Jn 2:13; Ex 12:1-3; Isa 1:13}
"And the Passover of the Jews was at hand." Inquiring into the accuracy of the most wise John (on this passage), I ask myself the question, "What is indicated by the addition "of the Jews"?  Of what other nation was the Passover a festival? Would it not have been enough to say, "And the Passover was at hand"? It may, however, be the case that the human Passover is one thing when kept by men not as Scripture intended. But the divine Passover is another thing-- the true Passover-- observed in spirit and truth by those who worship God in spirit and in truth. And so the distinction indicated in the text may be that between the divine Passover and that said to be of the Jews. We should notice the Passover law and observe what the Lord says of it when it is first mentioned in Scripture, "And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, … "It is the Passover of the Lord." He does not say, "It is your Passover."  Observe that in the Law we never find it said, "your Passover." Instead, in all the passages quoted the phrase occurs once without any adjunct, while we have three times "The Passover of the Lord." To make sure that there is such a distinction between the Passover of the Lord and the Passover of the Jews, we may consider the way in which Isaiah speaks of the matter: "Your new moons and your Sabbaths and your great day I cannot bear; your fast and your holiday and your new moons and your feasts my soul hates."   location 179020- 179036

{Zech 9:9-10; Quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament}
Those who stand on the letter [i.e., the literal interpretation] maintain that this is so with regard to the following part also of the prophecy, which runs: "And He shall destroy chariots from Ephraim and horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of the warrior shall be destroyed, and a multitude and peace from the Gentiles, and He shall rule over the waters as far as the sea, and the rivers to the ends of the earth," etc. … It is to be noted, too, that Matthew does not give the words as they are found in the prophet, for instead of "Rejoice greatly, you daughter of Zion, proclaim it, you daughter of Jerusalem," he makes it, "Tell you the daughter of Zion." He curtails the prophetic utterance by omitting the words, "Just is He and bringing salvation," then he gives, "meek and sitting," as in the original, but instead of "on an ass and a young colt," he gives, "on an ass and a colt the foal of an ass."   
The Jews, examining into the fulfillment of the prophecy to what is recorded about Jesus, press us in a way we cannot overlook with the inquiry how Jesus "destroyed chariots out of Ephraim and horse from Jerusalem," and how He destroyed the "bow of the enemy" and did the other deeds mentioned in the passage.

{Jn 2:16; Mt 21:13; Mk 11:17; Lk 19:46; Harmony of the Gospels}
The difficulties which met us on the part of those who were cast out of the temple by Jesus meet us here in a still greater degree. In the Gospel of John He casts out those who bought, but Matthew says that He cast out those who sold and those who bought in the temple. And the buyers would naturally be more numerous than the sellers. We have to consider if the casting out of buyers and sellers in the temple was not out of keeping with the reputation of one who was thought to be the Son of a carpenter, unless, as we said before, it was by a divine power that He subjected them. The words addressed to them, too, are harsher in the other Evangelists than in John. For John says that Jesus said to them, "Make not My Father's house a house of merchandise," while in the others they are rebuked for making the house of prayer "a den of robbers."   location 179316

"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." He could have exhibited a thousand other signs, but to the question, "Seeing that Thou do such things," He could not answer anything else; He fittingly gave the answer about the sign connected with the temple, and not about signs unconnected with the temple. Now, both of these two things, the temple and the body of Jesus, appear to me, in one interpretation at least, to be types of the Church, and to signify that it is built of living stones, a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus being the head corner-stone; and it is, therefore, called a temple. Now, from the text, "Ye are the body of Christ, and members each in his part," we see that even though the harmonious fitting of the stones of the temple appear to be dissolved and scattered, as it is written in the twenty-second Psalm, that all the bones of Christ are, by the plots made against it in persecutions and afflictions, on the part of those who war against the unity of the temple in persecutions, yet the temple will be raised again, and the body will rise again on the third day after the day of evil which threatens it, and the day of consummation which follows. For the third day will rise on the new heaven and the new earth, when these bones, the whole house of Israel, will rise in the great Lord's day, death having been overcome.

They belong to the house of Israel, or to the body of Christ, of which the Lord says, "All My bones are scattered," although the bones of His body were not scattered, and not even one of them was broken. But when the resurrection itself takes place of the true and more perfect body of Christ, then those who are now the members of Christ, for they will then be dry bones, will be brought together, bone to bone, and fitting to fitting (for none of those who are destitute of fitting (harmonia) will come to the perfect man), to the measure of the stature of the fullness of the body of Christ.

Now there are some who fall into confusion on this head of the Father and the Son, and we must devote a few words to them. They quote the text, "Yea, and we are found false witnesses for God, because we testified against God that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up" [--if in fact the dead do not rise.]  [1 Cor 15:15] and other similar texts which show the Raiser-up to be another person than He who was raised up; and the text, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up," as if it resulted from these that the Son did not differ in number from the Father, but that both were one, not only in point of substance but in point of subject, and that the Father and the Son were said to be different in some of their aspects but not in their hypostases. Against such views we must in the first place adduce the leading texts which prove the Son to be another than the Father, and that the Son must of necessity be the son of a Father, and the Father, the father of a Son.   …
He cannot do anything but what He sees the Father doing and saying, because whatever the Father does that the Son also does in like manner, and that He had raised the dead, i.e., the body, the Father granting Him this, who must be said to have been the principal agent in raising up Christ from the dead.   location 179506

{Jn 2:20; 1 Chr 29:27}
The Jews therefore said, "Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?" How the Jews said that the temple had been forty-six years building, we cannot tell, if we adhere to the history. For it is written in the third Book of Kings, that they prepared the stones and the wood three years, and in the fourth year, in the second month, when Solomon was king over Israel, the king commanded, and they brought great precious stones for the foundation of the house, and unhewn stones. And the sons of Solomon and the sons of Hiram hewed the stones and laid them in the fourth year.  … Thus comparing the time of its completion with the period of building, the building of it occupies less than eleven years. … For David reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem;   …
But someone else will say that the temple spoken of was not that built by Solomon, for that it was destroyed at the period of the captivity, but the temple built at the time of Ezra, with regard to which the forty-six years can be shown to be quite accurate. But in this Maccabean period things were very unsettled with regard to the people and the temple, and I do not know if the temple was really built in that number of years.

It may be asked whether this is to be taken in its plain sense, or whether we should try to connect each statement that is recorded about the temple, with the view we take about the body of Jesus, whether the body which He received from the Virgin, or that body of Christ which the Church is said to be, as we are said by the Apostle to be all members of His body. One may, on the one hand, suppose it to be hopeless to get everything that is said about the temple properly connected with the body, in whatever sense the body be taken, and one may have recourse to a simpler explanation, and say that the body (in either of these senses) is called the temple, because as the temple had the glory of God dwelling in it, so He who was the image and glory of God, the first-born of every creature, could rightly be called, in respect of His body or the Church, the temple containing the image.

Let us seek to find in the Church the truth of each statement made about the temple. If all Christ's enemies are made the footstool of His feet, and Death, the last enemy, is destroyed, then there will be the most perfect peace. Christ will be Solomon, which means "Peaceful," and the prophecy will find its fulfilment in Him, which says, "With those who hated peace I was peaceful." And then each of the living stones will be, according to the work of his life here, a stone of that temple, one, at the foundation, an apostle or a prophet, bearing those placed upon him, and another, after those in the foundation, and supported by the Apostles, will himself, with the Apostles, help to bear those in more need. One will be a stone of the inmost parts, where the ark is, and the cherubim, and the mercy-seat; another will be on the outer wall, and another even outside the outer wall of the Levites and priests, a stone of the altar of whole burnt offerings.

Then, too, on account of the profound peace, Hiram, king of Tyre, cooperates in the building of the temple, and gives his own sons to the sons of Solomon, to hew, in company with them, the great and precious stones for the holy place, which, in the fourth year, are placed in the foundation of the house of the Lord.

If we are not to take the view proper to old wives or Jews, of the promises recorded in the prophets, and especially in Isaiah, if, that is to say, we are to look for their fulfilment in connection with the Jerusalem on earth, then, as certain remarkable things connected with the building of the temple and the restoration of the people from the captivity are spoken of as happening after the captivity and the destruction of the temple, we must say that we are now the temple and the people which was carried captive, but is to come up again to Judæa and Jerusalem, and to be built with the precious stones of Jerusalem.
…
The prophecies of Isaiah which we mentioned are the following: "Behold I prepare for thy stone carbuncle and for thy foundation sapphire; and I will make thy battlements jasper, and thy gates stones of crystal, and thy outer wall choice stones; and all thy sons shall be taught of the Lord, and in great peace shall thy children be, and in righteousness shalt thou be built." And a little further on, to the same Jerusalem: "And the glory of Lebanon shall come to thee with cypress, and pine, and cedar, along with those who will glorify My holy place. And the sons of them that humbled thee and insulted thee shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called the city of the Lord, Sion of holy Israel, because thou wert desolate and hated, and there was none to help thee. And I will make thee an eternal delight, a joy of generations of generations. And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles and shall eat the riches of kings, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord that saves thee and the God of Israel that chooseth thee. And instead of brass I will bring thee gold, and instead of iron I will bring thee silver, and for wood I will bring thee brass, and for stones iron. And I will establish thy rulers in peace and thy overseers in righteousness. And wickedness shall no more be heard in thy land, nor affliction and distress in thy borders, but thy walls shall be called salvation and thy gates sculpture. And the sun shall no longer be to thee for light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon give light to thee by night, but Christ shall be to thee an everlasting light and thy God thy glory. For thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not fail, for thy Lord shall be to thee an everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled." These prophecies clearly refer to the age still to come, and they are addressed to the children of Israel in their captivity, to whom He was sent and came, who said, "I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Such things, though they are captives, they are to receive in their own land; and proselytes also are to come to them at that time through Christ, and are to fly to them, according to the saying, "Behold, proselytes shall come to thee through Me, and shall flee to thee for refuge." And if all this is to take place with the captives, then it is plain that they must be about their temple, and that they must go up there again to be built up, having become the most precious of stones. For we find with John in his Apocalyse, the promise made to him that overcomes, that he will be a pillar in the temple of God, and will go out no more. All this I have said with a view to our obtaining a cursory view at least of the matters pertaining to the temple, and the house of God,   location 179648

"Now, when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His signs which He did. But He, Jesus, did not trust Himself to them, because He knew all (men)." … Believing in His name is a different thing from believing in Him. For the Lord says, "He that believes in Me is not judged," not, "He who believes in My name is not judged;" the latter believes, and hence he is not worthy to be condemned already, but he is inferior to the other who believes in Him. Hence it is that Jesus does not trust Himself to him who believes in His name. We must, therefore, cleave to Him rather than to His name, lest after we have done wonders in His name, we should hear these words addressed to us which He will speak to those who boast of His name alone.

{Preface to Matthew; Preface to Mark; Preface to Luke; Preface to John; 1 Pet 5:13}
Concerning the four Gospels which alone are uncontroverted in the Church of God under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the Gospel According to Matthew was written first. Matthew was at one time a tax collector and afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ. He composed it in the Hebrew tongue and published it for the converts from Judaism. The second [Gospel] written was that according to Mark, who wrote it according to the instruction of Peter, who, in his General Epistle, acknowledged him as a son, saying, "The church that is in Babylon, elect together with you, salutes you; and so does Mark my son." And third, was that according to Luke, the Gospel commended by Paul, which he composed for the converts from the Gentiles. Last of all was that [Gospel] according to John.    location 179729

And here, accordingly, the kingdom of heaven is "like unto a net that was cast into the sea." It is not, as supposed by some, that there are many different natures of the righteous and likewise also of the evil. For to such an interpretation all the Scriptures are opposed, which emphasize the freedom of the will. The Scriptures censure those who sin and approve those who do right. Otherwise blame could not rightly attach to those of the kinds that were such by nature, nor praise to those of a better kind. . . . We are responsible for our being good "kinds" and worthy of being gathered into what are called "vessels." Or we are responsible for being bad, and worthy of being cast outside. For it is not the nature in us which is the cause of the evil, but it is the voluntary choice [we make] that works evil.    location 179940

You never see the kinds of things in the water changing from the bad kinds of fishes into the good, or from the better kind to the worse. However, you can always behold the righteous or evil among men either coming from wickedness to virtue, or returning from progress towards virtue to the flood of wickedness. Therefore, also in Ezekiel, concerning the man who turns away from unrighteousness to the keeping of the divine commandments, it is thus written: "But if the wicked man turn away from all his wickedness which he has done," etc., down to the words, "that he turn from his wicked way and live;" but concerning the man who returns from the advance towards virtue unto the flood of wickedness it is said, "But in the case of the righteous man turning away from his righteousness and committing iniquity," etc., down to the words, "in his sins which he has sinned in them shall he die." location 179946   (Ezek 18:20-24)

Now, these things being said, we must hold that "the kingdom of heaven is likened to a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind," in order to set forth the varied character of the principles of action among men, which are as different as possible from each other, so that the expression "gathered from every kind" embraces both those worthy of praise and those worthy of blame in respect of their proclivities towards the forms of virtues or of vices. And the kingdom of heaven is likened unto the variegated texture of a net, with reference to the Old and the New Scripture which is woven of thoughts of all kinds and greatly varied. As in the case of the fish that fall into the net, some are found in one part of the net and some in another part, and each at the part at which it was caught, so in the case of those who have come into the net of the Scriptures you would find some caught in the Prophetic net; for example, of Isaiah, according to this expression, or of Jeremiah or of Daniel; and others in the net of the Law, and others in the Gospel net, and some in the Apostolic net.

And here He seems to represent the disciples as having been scribes before the kingdom of heaven; but to this is opposed what is said in the Acts of the Apostles thus, "Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled, and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus." Someone may inquire in regard to these things—if they were scribes, how are they spoken of in the Acts as unlearned and ignorant men? Or if they were unlearned and ignorant men, how are they very plainly called scribes by the Savior? And it might be answered to these inquiries that, as a matter of fact, not all the disciples but only Peter and John are described in the Acts as unlearned and ignorant, but that there were more disciples in regard to whom, because they understood all things (Mt 13:51), it is said, "Every scribe," etc.

Now since "every scribe who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder who brings forth out of his treasury things new and old," it clearly follows, by "conversion of the proposition," as it is called, that everyone who does not bring forth out of his treasury "things new and old," is not a scribe who has been made a disciple unto the kingdom of heaven. We must endeavor, therefore, in every way to gather in our heart, by giving heed to  not only the "new" oracles of the Gospels and of the Apostles and their revelation, but also the "old" things in the Law "which is the shadow of the good things to come," and in the Prophets who prophesied in accordance with them.    location 180055

However, Elijah did not suffer dishonor in Tishbeth of Gilead, nor Elisha in Abelmeholah, nor Samuel in Ramathaim, nor Jeremiah in Anathoth. But, broadly interpreted, it is absolutely true. For we must think of Judaea as their "country," and that famous Israel as their "kindred," and perhaps of the body as the "house." For all suffered dishonor in Judaea from the Israel which is according to the flesh, while they were yet in the body, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, as having been spoken in censure to the people, "Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute, who showed before of the coming of the Righteous one?" And by Paul in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians like things are said: "For you brethren became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things of your own countrymen even as they did of the Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drave out us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men." A prophet, then, is not without honor among the Gentiles; for either they do not know him at all, or, having learned and received him as a prophet, they honor him. And such are those who are of the Church. Prophets suffer dishonor, first, when they are persecuted, according to historical fact, by the people. And, secondly, when their prophecy is not believed by the people. For if they had believed Moses and the prophets they would have believed Christ.

{Mt 13:57; Jer 20:9; Jer 20:7; Heb 11:37}
And so far as the literal truth is concerned [of Mt 13:57], it is useful to recount what things
Jeremiah suffered among the people in relation to which he said, "And I said, I will not speak, nor will I call upon the name of the Lord." And again, elsewhere, "I was continually being mocked." And how great sufferings he endured from the then king of Israel are written in his prophecy. And it is also written that some of the people often came to stone Moses to death. . . . And Isaiah is reported to have been sawn asunder by the people. And if anyone does not accept the statement because of its being found in the pseudepigraphal  Isaiah, let him believe what is written thus in the Epistle to the Hebrews, "They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted." For the expression, "They were sawn asunder," refers to Isaiah. Similarly, the words, "They were slain with the sword," refer to Zacharias, who was slain "between the sanctuary and the altar," as the Savior taught, bearing testimony, as I think, to a Scripture, though not extant in the common and widely circulated books, but perhaps in apocryphal [hidden] books.    location 180147

In reference to these things, it seems to me, that as the Law and the Prophets were until John, after whom the gift of prophecy ceased from among the Jews; so the authority of those who had rule among the people, which included the power to kill those whom they thought worthy of death, existed until John. And when the last of the prophets was unlawfully killed by Herod, the king of the Jews was deprived of the power of putting to death. For, if Herod had not been deprived of it, Pilate would not have condemned Jesus to death. Rather, Herod would have sufficed for this [putting Jesus to death], along with the council of the chief priests and elders of the people, when they met for this purpose.    location 180227

And the prophet [John] is beheaded, because of an oath in a case where the duty was rather to break the oath than to keep the oath. For the charge of rashness in taking an oath and of breaking it because of the rashness is not the same as the guilt for the death of a prophet. And not on this account alone is John beheaded, but because "of those who sat at meat with him," who preferred that the prophet should be killed rather than live.  … At times you may make a tactful application of the passage to those who swear rashly and wish to hold fast oaths which are taken with a view to unlawful deeds-- by saying that not every keeping of oaths is proper, just as the keeping of the oath of Herod was not.    location 180263

For who would still hesitate about avoiding such things, when not only did Jesus retreat in view of what happened to John, but also taught and said, "If they persecute you in this city, flee you into the other"? When a temptation comes which is not in our power to avoid, we must endure it with exceeding nobleness and courage; but, when it is in our power to avoid it, not to do so is rash.    location 180273

{1 Cor 11:30; Jude 8}
The Apostle indeed says, writing to the Corinthians who had diverse sicknesses, "For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep." Hear him in these words, knitting a band and making it woven of different sins-- according as some are "weak," and others "sickly" more than weak, and others, in comparison with both, are "asleep." For some, because of impotence of the soul, having a tendency to slip into any sin whatever, although they may not be wholly in the grasp of any form of sin, as the sickly are, are only weak. But others who, instead of loving God "with all their soul and all their heart and all their mind," love money, or a little glory, or wife, or children, are suffering from something worse than weakness, and are "sickly." And those who sleep are those who, when they ought to be taking heed and watching with the soul, are not doing this. Rather, because of great lack of attention, they are nodding in resolution and are drowsy in their reflections. They are like those who "in their dreams defile the flesh, and set at naught that which is highest in authority, and rail at dignities." And these, because they are asleep, live in an atmosphere of vain and dream-like fancies concerning realities, not admitting the things which are actually true.    location 180303

{Ex 20:12; Lev 20:9; Mt 15:3-6; Lk 16:14; Corban}
And God said, "Honor your father and your mother," teaching that the child should pay the honor which is due to his parents. Of this honor to parents one part was to share with them the necessaries of life, such as food and clothing, and if there was any other thing in which it was possible for them to show favor towards their own parents. But the Pharisees and scribes promulgated in opposition to the Law a tradition which is found rather obscurely in the Gospel, and which we ourselves would not have thought of, unless one of the Hebrews had given to us the following facts relating to the passage. Sometimes, he says, when money-lenders fell in with stubborn debtors who were able but not willing to pay their debts, the money-lenders consecrated what was due to the account of the poor, for whom money was cast into the treasury by each of those who wished to give a portion of their goods to the poor, according to their ability. They, therefore, said sometimes to their debtors in their own tongue, "That which you owe to me is Corban,"—that is, a gift—"for I have consecrated it to the poor, to the account of piety towards God." Then the debtor, as no longer in debt to men but to God and to piety towards God, was cornered, as it were. Even though he was unwilling to pay the debt the money-lender, but was now obligated to God for the account of the poor, in name of the money-lender. What then the money-lender did to the debtor, some sons likewise did to their parents. They said to them, "That wherewith you might have been profited by me, father or mother, know that you will receive this from Corban," from the account of the poor who are consecrated to God. Then the parents, hearing that that which should have been given to them was Corban,—consecrated to God,—no longer wished to take it from their sons, even though they were in extreme need of the necessaries of life. The elders, then, declared to the people a tradition of this kind, "Whoever said to his father or mother, that which should be given to any of them is Corban and a gift, that man was no longer a debtor to his father or mother in respect of giving to them the necessaries of life." The Savior censures this tradition, as not being sound, but as being opposed to the commandment of God. For God says, "Honor your father and your mother." But the tradition said, he is not bound to honor his father or mother by a gift if he has consecrated to God, as Corban, that which would have been given to his parents. Obviously, the commandment of God concerning the honor due to parents was made void by this tradition of the Pharisees and scribes. For it said that he was no longer bound to honor his father or mother, who had, once for all, consecrated to God that which the parents would have received. As lovers of money, the Pharisees promoted this teaching, in order that under pretext of being "the poor" they might receive even that which would have been given to the parents of anyone. And the Gospel testifies to their love of money, saying, "But the Pharisees who were lovers of money heard these things and they scoffed at Him." If, then, anyone of those who are called elders among us, or of those who are in any way rulers of the people, profess to give to the poor under the name of the commonweal, rather than to be of those who give to their kindred if they should chance to be in need of the necessaries of life, and those who give cannot do both, this man might with justice be called a brother of those Pharisees who made void the word of God through their own tradition.   location 180548

However, as for things which are in their own nature indifferent it is becoming of God to leave them in their own place. For they may, according to our choice and the reason which is in us, be done ill if we sin in them, but be done well if rightly directed by us.     location 180640

But as for us who know that some things are used by demons-- or if we do not know, but suspect, and are in doubt about it-- if we use such things, we have used them not to the glory of God, nor in the name of Christ. For not only does the suspicion that things have been sacrificed to idols condemn him who eats, but even the doubt concerning this. For "he that doubts," according to the Apostle, "is condemned if he eats, because he eats not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin." He then eats in faith who believes that that which is eaten has not been sacrificed in the temples of idols, and that it is not strangled nor blood. But he who is in doubt about any of these things does not eat of faith. … And the man who knowing that they have been sacrificed to demons nevertheless uses them, becomes a communicant with demons.

For just as the belly, though it is not the god of those who prize pleasure too highly-- being lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God-- is said by Paul to be their god, so the prince of this world, in regard to whom the Savior says, "Now has the prince of this world been judged," though he is not God, is said to be the god of those who do not wish to receive the spirit of adoption.

For since there are two things to be understood in regard to the Law: (1) the ministration of death which was engraved in letters and which had no kinship with the spirit, and (2) the ministration of life which is understood in the spiritual law. Accordingly, those who were able with a sincere heart to say, "We know that the Law is spiritual," and therefore "the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good," were the plant which the heavenly Father planted.

Now someone when dealing with the passage might say that, just as "not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man," -- even though it may be thought by the Jews to be defiled -- so likewise not that which enters into the mouth sanctifies the man, even though what is called the bread of the Lord [i.e., communion] may be thought by the simpler disciples to sanctify. And the saying is I think, not to be despised. For this reason, it demands clear exposition, which seems to me to be thus: as it is not the meat-- but the conscience of him who eats with doubt which defiles him that eats -- so that which is sanctified through the word of God and prayer does not, in its own nature, sanctify him who uses it. For, if this were so, it would sanctify even him who eats unworthily of the bread of the Lord, and no one on account of this food would become weak or sickly or asleep for eating unworthily.    location 180722

And in the case of the bread of the Lord, accordingly, there is advantage to him who uses it, when with undefiled mind and pure conscience he partakes of the bread. And so neither by not eating, I mean by the very fact that we do not eat of the bread which has been sanctified by the word of God and prayer, are we deprived of any good thing, nor by eating are we the better by any good thing; for the cause of our lacking is wickedness and sins, and the cause of our abounding is righteousness and right actions; so that such is the meaning of what is said by Paul, "For neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we eat not are we the worse."   … And it is not the material of the bread but the word which is said over it which is of advantage to him who eats it not unworthily of the Lord.  … But many things might be said about the Word Himself who became flesh, and true food of which he that eats shall assuredly live forever, no worthless person being able to eat it. For if it were possible for one who continues worthless to eat of Him who became flesh, who was the Word and the living bread, it would not have been written, that "everyone who eats of this bread shall live forever."    location 180734

But when we have understood how each of the sins through which there is a way to Hades is a gate of Hades, we shall apprehend that the soul that has "spot or wrinkle or any such thing," and because of wickedness is neither holy nor blameless, is neither a rock upon which Christ builds, nor a church, nor part of a church which Christ builds upon the rock. But if anyone wishes to put us to shame in regard to these things because of the great majority of those of the church who are thought to believe, it must be said to him, "Not only are 'many called, but few chosen.'" In addition, we should remember that which was said by the Savior to those who come to Him, as it is recorded in Luke in these words, "Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in through the narrow door and shall not be able;" and also that which is written in the Gospel of Matthew thus, "For narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it." . . . So you will understand that this refers to those who boast that they are of the church, but live weakly and contrary to the Word. … And though the gates of Hades are many and almost innumerable, no gate of Hades will prevail against the rock or against the church which Christ builds upon it. Notwithstanding, these gates have a certain power by which they gain the mastery over some who do not resist and strive against them; but they are overcome by others who, because they do not turn aside from Him who said, "I am the door," have erased from their soul all the gates of Hades. And this also we must know that as the gates of cities have each their own names, in the same way the gates of Hades might be named after the species of sins; so that one gate of Hades is called "Fornication," through which fornicators go, and another "Denial," through which the deniers of God go down into Hades.    location 181185

Now, the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, Dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, Self-control; and so a gate of death, Unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, Righteousness, which the prophet shows forth saying, "This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it."    … You can say that each power and world-ruler of this darkness, and each one of the "spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places" is a gate of Hades and a gate of death.    location 181198

For he is worthy to receive from the same Word the keys of the kingdom of heaven, who is fortified against the gates of Hades so that they do not prevail against him. He receives, as it were, for a prize, the keys of the kingdom of heaven, because the gates of Hades had no power against him,  … Consider what great power the rock has upon which the church is built by Christ, and what great power everyone has who says, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." For the judgments of this man abide sure, as if God were judging in him, that in the very act of judging, the gates of Hades shall not prevail against him. But when one judges unrighteously, and does not bind upon earth according to the Word of God, nor loose upon earth according to His will, the gates of Hades prevail against him; … But when those who maintain the function of bishop make use of this word as Peter, and, having received the keys of the kingdom of heaven from the Savior, teach that things bound by them, that is to say, condemned, are also bound in heaven, and that those which have obtained remission by them are also loosed in heaven, we must say that they speak wholesomely if they have the way of life on account of which it was said to that Peter, "You are Peter." It is true only if they are such that upon them the church is built by Christ, and to them with good reason this could be referred; and the gates of Hades ought not to prevail against him when he wishes to bind and loose. . . . But if he is tightly bound with the cords of his sins, to no effect does he bind and loose.    … And if anyone who is not a Peter, and does not possess the things here spoken of, imagines as a Peter that he will so bind on earth that the things bound are bound in heaven, and will so loose on earth that the things loosed are loosed in heaven, he is puffed up, not understanding the meaning of the Scriptures, and, being puffed up, has fallen into the ruin of the devil.    location 181240

If anyone, who has grasped what salvation really is, wishes to procure the salvation of his own life, let this man having taken farewell of this life, and denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following me, lose his own life to the world; for having lost it for my sake and for the sake of all my teaching, he will gain the end of loss of this kind—salvation.    location 181426

But someone might ask, "If the soul of Elijah was not first in the Tishbite and secondly in John, what was there in both that the Savior called Elijah?" And I say that Gabriel in his words to Zacharias suggested what the substance was in Elijah and John that was the same; for he says, "Many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God; and he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah." For, observe, he did not say in the "soul" of Elijah, in which case the doctrine of transmigration might have some ground, but "in the spirit and power of Elijah." For the Scripture well knows the distinction between spirit and soul, as, "May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ;" and the passage, "Bless the Lord, you spirits and souls of the righteous"* as it stands in the book of Daniel, according to the Septuagint, represents the difference between spirit and soul. Elijah, therefore, was not called John because of the soul, but because of the "spirit and the power," which in no way conflicts with the teaching of the church. Dan 3:86 [LXX]

Moreover to the saying, "They that received the half-shekel came to Peter," you will adduce from Numbers that, for the saints according to the law of God, is paid not a simple half-shekel, but a "sacred half-shekel." For it is written, "And you shall take five shekels per head, according to the sacred half-shekel."

{Mt 18:1; Mt 16:16-17; Mt 16:23; Jn 13:23; Mt 17:24-27}
"In that day came the disciples unto Jesus saying, 'Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'" In order that we might be taught what it was that the disciples came to Jesus and asked to learn of Him, and how He answered their inquiry, Matthew, though he might have given an account of this very thing only, has added, according to some manuscripts, "In that hour the disciples came unto Jesus," but, according to other manuscripts, "In that day." And it is necessary that we should not leave the meaning of the evangelist without examination.  … 
Then, when Peter answered and said to them, "Yes," Jesus, giving further a defense with reference to the giving of the half-shekel, sends Peter to drag up the fish into the net, in the mouth of which He said that a stater would be found which was to be given for Himself and Peter. It seems to me, then, that thinking that this was a very great honor which had been bestowed on Peter by Jesus, who judged that he was greater than the rest of His friends, they wished to learn accurately the truth of their suspicion, by making inquiry of Jesus and hearing from Him whether, as they supposed, He had judged that Peter was greater than they. And at the same time also they hoped to learn the ground on which Peter had been preferred to the rest of the disciples. 
Matthew then, I think, wishing to make this plain, has subjoined to the words "take this"—the stater, to-wit—"and give unto them for you and me," the words, "In that day came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" And, perhaps, they were also in doubt because of the preference which had been given to the three at the transfiguration, and they were in doubt about this—which of the three was judged by the Lord to be greatest. For John reclined on His breast through love, and we may conclude that before the Supper they had seen many tokens of special honor given by Jesus to John. However, Peter on his confession was called blessed in their hearing, because of his saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." But again because of the saying, "Get you behind Me, Satan; You are a stumbling-block unto Me, for you mindest not the things of God but the things of men," they were distracted in mind as to whether it was not he, but one of the sons of Zebedee, that was the greatest.

{2 Cor 4:10; 1 Cor 14:20; Gal 5:23; Rom 8:13; Jas 1:19-20}
If anyone who is a man mortifies the lusts of manhood, putting to death by the spirit the deeds of the body, and "always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus," to such a degree that he has the condition of a little child who has not tasted sensual pleasures, and has had no conception of the impulses of manhood, then such a person is converted, and has become as little children. And the greater the advance he has made towards the condition of little children in regard to such emotions, by so much the more as compared with those who are in training and have not advanced to so great a height of self-control, is he the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. But that which has been said about little children in respect of lustful pleasures, the same might also be said in regard to the rest of the affections and infirmities and sicknesses of the soul, into which it is not the nature of little children to fall, who have not yet fully attained to the possession of reason. As, for example, that, if anyone be converted, and, though a man, such a one becomes as a child in respect of anger. Likewise, as is the child in relation to grief, so that sometimes a child laughs and plays at the very time that his father or mother or brother is dead, he who is converted would become such a one as little children. And, having received from the Word a disposition incapable of grief, so that he becomes like the little child in regard to grief. And the like you will say about what is called pleasure, in regard to which the wicked are irrationally lifted up, from which little children are not affected. Nor are those who have been converted and become as little children. As, then, it has been accurately demonstrated also by others, that no passion is incident to little children who have not yet attained to full possession of reason. And if no passion affects them, clearly fear, too, does not affect them. However, even if there is anything corresponding to the passions, these are faint, and very quickly suppressed, and healed in the case of little children. Accordingly, he is worthy of love, who, being converted as the little children, has reached such a point as to have, as it were, his passions in subjection like the little children. And with regard to fear, therefore, similar things to those spoken might be conceived, that the little children do not experience the fear of the wicked, but a different thing, to which those who have an accurate knowledge of questions in regard to the passions and their names give the name of fear. For example, in the case of children there is a forgetfulness of their evils at the very time of their tears. For they change in a moment, and laugh and play along with those who were thought to grieve and terrify them, but in truth had wrought in them no such emotion. So too, one like a little child will humble himself. For neither haughtiness, nor conceit in respect of noble birth, or wealth, or any of those things which are thought to be good-- but really are not-- comes to a little child. Wherefore you might see those who are not altogether infants, up to three or four years of age, similar to those who are of lowly birth, though they may seem to be of noble birth, and not appearing at all to love rich children rather than the poor.   location 182069

{Mt 18:7; Jn 1:10; Deut 4:19; Greek-Kosmos}
"Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling." The expression "cosmos," is used in itself and absolutely in the passage, "He was in the cosmos and the cosmos knew Him not," but it is used relatively and in respect of its connection with that of which it is the cosmos, in the words, "Lest you look up to the heaven, and seeing the sun, and the moon, and all the cosmos of the heavens, you should stray and bow down to them and worship them." And the like you will find in the Book of Esther, spoken about her, when it is written, stripping off all her "cosmos." For the word "cosmos," simply, is not the same as the "cosmos" of heaven, or the "cosmos" of Esther; and this which we are now investigating is another. I think, then, that the world is not this compacted whole of heaven and earth according to the Divine Scriptures, but only the place which is round about the earth, and this is not to be conceived in respect of the whole earth, but only in respect of ours which is inhabited; for the true light "was in the world," that is, in the place which is around, conceived in relation to our part of the earth; "and the world knew Him not," that is, the men in the region round about, and perhaps also the powers that have an affinity to this place.

{Mt 18:6-7; 1 Cor 8:11-12; 1 Jn 1:8; Lk 18:1; Free Will}
But that the woe is worse in the case of him who causes to stumble, than in him who is made to stumble, you may prove by the passage, "Whoever shall cause to stumble one of these little ones which believe in Me, it is profitable for him," etc.. For, while the little one who is made to stumble receives retribution from him who caused him to stumble, it is appropriate that the severe and intolerable punishment which is written should befall the man who has caused the stumbling. But if we were to give more careful consideration to these things, we should be on our guard against sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, lest we sin against Christ; as often our brethren about us, "for whom Christ died," perish, not only through our knowledge, but also through some other causes connected with us; in the case of whom, we, sinning against Christ, shall pay the penalty, the soul of them who perish through us being required of us. … There is a necessity also that wickedness should exist before virtue in men. And stumbling-blocks arise from this wickedness. For it is impossible that a man should be found altogether sinless. . . . However, there is no necessity that stumbling blocks should come through any particular person. Therefore, the "woe" falls on the man through whom the stumbling-block comes.  . . . For just as God did not make death, so neither did He create stumbling-blocks; but free-will begot the stumbling-blocks.    location 182236

Likewise, even if the wife of our bosom, or a friend. . . .

{Titus 3:5; 1 Pet 1:2; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 8:29; Acts 12:13-15; Guardian Angels; Baptism}
Then again one might inquire at what time those who are called "their angels" assume guardianship of the little ones pointed out by Christ. Perhaps they received this commission to discharge concerning them, from the time "by the laver of regeneration," through which they were born "as new-born babes, they long for the reasonable milk which is without guile," and no longer are in subjection to any wicked power. Or perhaps it is from [natural] birth they had been appointed, according to the foreknowledge and predestination of God, over those whom God also foreknew, and foreordained to be conformed to the glory of the Christ.  … With reference to the words, "When through the laver I became a child in Christ," (Tit. iii. 5; 1 Pet. ii. 2) it perhaps may be said, that there is no holy angel present with those who are still in wickedness, but that during the period of unbelief they are under the angels of Satan. However, after the regeneration, He who has redeemed us with His own blood consigns us to a holy angel, who also, because of his purity, beholds the face of God. 
… But since in what we said above, that the little ones have angels, but that the great have passed beyond such a position, someone will quote in opposition to us from the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written, that a certain maid Rhoda, when Peter knocked at the door, came to answer, and recognizing the voice of Peter, ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate. But when they who were gathered together in the house wondered, and thought that it was quite impossible that Peter truly stood before the gate, they said, It is his angel. For the objector will say that, as they had learned once for all that each of the believers had some definite angel, they knew that Peter also had one.  location 182323

"If your brother sin against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone." He, then, who attends closely to the expression, in proof of the surpassing philanthropy of Jesus, will say, that as the words do not suggest a difference of sins, they will act in a singular manner and contrary to the goodness of Jesus, who supply the thought, that these words are to be understood as being limited in their application to lesser sins. 
But another, also attending closely to the expression, and not wishing to introduce these extraneous thoughts, nor admitting that it is spoken about every sin, will say, that he who commits those great sins is not a brother, even if he be called a brother, as the Apostle says, "If anyone that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, etc., with such a person not to eat;" for no one who is an idolater, or a fornicator, or covetous, is a brother; for if he, who seems to bear the name of Christ, though he is named a brother, has something of the features of these, he would not rightly be called a brother. 
As then he, who says that such words are spoken about every sin, whether the sin be murder, or poisoning, or paederasty, or anything of that sort, would give occasion of injury to the exceeding goodness of Christ, so, on the contrary, he who distinguishes between the brother and him who is called the brother, might teach that, in the case of the least of the sins of men, he who has not repented after the telling of the fault is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, for sins which are not "mortal" or, as the Law has described them in the Book of Numbers, not "death-bringing." This would seem to be very harsh; for I do not think that anyone will readily be found who has not been censured thrice for the same form of sin, say, reviling, with which revilers abuse their neighbors, or those who are carried away by passion, or for over-drinking, or lying and idle words, or any of those things which exist in the masses. 
You will inquire, therefore, whether any observation of the passage has escaped the notice of those, who are influenced by their conception of the goodness of the Word, and grant pardon to those who have committed the greatest sins, as well as of those who teach that, in the case of the very least sins, he is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, making him a stranger to the church, after he has committed three very trivial transgressions. 
But the following seems to me to have been overlooked by both of them, namely, the words, "You have gained your brother." It is assigned by the Word to him only who heard, and He no longer applies it in the case of him who has stumbled twice or thrice and been censured; but that which was to be said about him who was censured twice or thrice, corresponding to the saying, "You have gained your brother," He has left in the air, so to speak. He is not, therefore, altogether gained, nor will he altogether perish, or he will receive stripes. And attend carefully to the first passage, "If he hear you, you have gained your brother," and to the second passage, which is literally, "If he hear you not, take with yourself one or two more, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established." What, then, will happen to him who has been censured for the second time, after every word has been established by two or three witnesses, He has left us to conceive. And, again, "If he refuse to hear them"—manifestly, the witnesses who have been taken—"tell it," he says, "to the church;" and He does not say what he will suffer if he does not hear the church, but He taught that if he refused to hear the church, then he who had thrice admonished, and had not been heard, was to regard him for the future as the Gentile and the publican. Therefore he is not altogether gained, nor will he altogether perish. But what at all he will suffer, who at first did not hear, but required witnesses, or even refused to hear these, but was brought to the church, God knows; for we do not declare it, according to the precept, "Judge not that you be not judged," "until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts." But, with reference to the seeming harshness in the case of those who have committed less sins, one might say that it is not possible for him who has not heard twice in succession to hear the third time, so as, on this account, no longer to be as a Gentile or a publican, or no longer to stand in need of the censure in presence of all the church. For we must bear in mind this, "So it is not the will of My Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish." For if "we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether it be good or bad," let each one with all his power do what he can so that he may not receive punishment for more evil things done in the body, even if he is going to receive back for all the wrongs which he has done; but it should be our ambition to procure the reward for a greater number of good deeds, since "with what measure we mete, it shall be measured to us," and, "according to the works of our own hands shall it happen unto us."  location 182377

"Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them." . . . So much then for the more common understanding of the two or three whom the Word exhorts to be in agreement. But now let us also touch upon another interpretation which was uttered by someone of our predecessors, exhorting those who were married to sanctity and purity. For by the two, he says, whom the Word desires to agree on earth, we should understand the husband and wife, who by agreement defraud each other of bodily intercourse that they may give themselves unto prayer. When if they pray for anything whatever that they shall ask, they shall receive it. The request is granted to them by the Father in heaven of Jesus Christ on the ground of such agreement. And this interpretation does not appear to me to cause dissolution of marriage, but to be an incitement to agreement. Nevertheless, if the one wished to be pure, but the other did not desire it, and on this account he who willed and was able to fulfil the better part, yield to the one who had not the power or the will, they would not both have the accomplishment from the Father in heaven of Jesus Christ, of anything whatever that they might ask. location 182457

Let us first look at the rational coins and the tested money of the householder, of which one receives more and another less, for according to the ability of each, to one are given five talents as he has the ability to administer so many, but to another two as not being able to receive the amount of the man before him,    location 182558

{Mt 19:3; Mt 22:17}
And I think that the Pharisees put forward this word for this reason, that they might attack Him whatever He might say. For example, if He had said, "It is lawful," they would have accused Him of dissolving marriages for trifles. However, if He had said, "It is not lawful," they would have accused Him of permitting a man to dwell with a woman even with sins. So, likewise, in the case of the tribute-money, if He had told them to give, they would have accused Him of making the people subject to the Romans, and not to the law of God. But if He had told them not to give, they would have accused Him of creating war and sedition, and of stirring up those who were not able to stand against so powerful an army.    location 182771

{Gen 1:27; Mt 19:5}
For where it is said, "Male and female made He them," the reference is to those formed "after the image." But where He also said, "For this cause shall a man leave his own father and mother," etc., the reference is not to those formed after the image; for some time after the Lord God formed the man, taking dust from the ground, and from his side the helpmate. And take note, at the same time, that in the case of those who are formed "after the image," the words were not "husband and wife" but "male and female." But we have also observed this same thing in the Hebrew. For "man" is indicated by the word "ish," but "male" by the word "zachar." And again "woman" by the word "ishah," but "female" by the word "agkeba." For at no time is it "woman" or "man" that is "after the image," but the superior class, the male, and the second, the female. But also if a man leaves his mother and his father, he cleaves not to the "female," but to his own "wife," and "they become one flesh," since man and woman are one in flesh.    location 182789

Christ keeping the saying, "What God has joined together let not man put asunder," did not put away His former wife, so to speak—that is, the former synagogue—for any other cause than that that wife committed fornication, being made an adulteress by the evil one, and along with him plotted against her husband and slew Him, saying, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, crucify Him, crucify Him."

And, for the sake of the church, the Lord—the husband—left the Father whom He saw when He was "in the form of God," left also His mother, as He was the very son of the Jerusalem which is above, and was joined to His wife who had fallen down here, and these two here became one flesh. For because of her, He Himself also became flesh, when "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us," and they are no more two, but now they are one flesh, since it is said to the wife, "Now you are the body of Christ, and members each in his part;" for the body of Christ is not something apart different from the church, which is His body, and from the members each in his part.

Now, keeping in mind what we said above in regard to the passage from Isaiah about the bill of divorcement, we will say that the mother of the people separated herself from Christ, her husband, without having received the bill of divorcement, but afterwards when there was found in her an unseemly thing, and she did not find favor in his sight, the bill of divorcement was written out for her. For when the new covenant called those of the Gentiles to the house of Him who had cast away his former wife, it effectively gave the bill of divorcement to her who formerly separated from her husband—the Law, and the Word.    Therefore they can no longer do the things commanded on them by the Law, because of the bill of divorcement. And a sign that she has received the bill of divorcement is this, that Jerusalem was destroyed along with what they called the sanctuary of the things in it which were believed to be holy, and with the altar of burnt offerings, and all the worship associated with it. And a further sign of the bill of divorcement is this, that they cannot keep their feasts, even though according to the letter of the Law designedly commanded them, in the place which the Lord God appointed to them for keeping feasts. But there is this also, that the whole synagogue has become unable to stone those who have committed this or that sin. And thousands of things commanded are a sign of the bill of divorcement.     
And the fact that "there is no more a prophet," and that they say, "We no longer see signs;" for the Lord says, "He has taken away from Judaea and from Jerusalem," according to the word of Isaiah, "Him that is mighty, and her that is mighty, a powerful giant," etc., down to the words, "a prudent hearer." And what was more unseemly than the fact, that they all said in His case, "Crucify Him, crucify Him," and "Away with such a fellow from the earth"? And can this be freed from the charge of unseemliness, "His blood be upon us, and upon our children"?    location 182857

{Col 2:14; Deut 24:1; Jews, Unbelieving}
And, about the same time, I think, the husband wrote out a bill of divorcement to his former wife, and gave it into her hands, and sent her away from his own house, and the bond of her who came from the Gentiles has been cancelled about which the Apostle says, "Having blotted out the bond written in ordinances, which was contrary to us, and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross;" for Paul also and others became proselytes of Israel for her who came from the Gentiles.    location 182861

But also in their case the latter husband dies, perhaps whenever the last enemy of Christ, death, is destroyed. But whichever of these things may happen, whether the former or the latter to the wife, the former husband, it says, who sent her away, will not he able to turn back and take her to be a wife to himself after she has been defiled, since "it is abomination," it says, "before the Lord your God." 
But these things will not seem to be consistent with this, "If the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, all Israel shall be saved."6203 But consider if it can be said to this, that, if she shall be saved by her former husband returning and taking her to himself as wife, she will in any case be saved after she has been polluted. A priest, then, will not take to himself as a wife one who has been a harlot and an outcast, but no other, as being inferior to the priest, is hindered from doing so. But if you seek for the harlot in regard to the calling of the Gentiles, you may use the passage, "Take to yourself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication," . . . For as the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath, and not the slave of the sabbath as the people are, so He who gives the law has power to give it "until a time of reformation," and to change the law, and, when the time of the reformation is at hand, also to give after the former way and after the former heart another way and another heart, "in an acceptable time, and in a day of salvation."

And if one should dare, using a Scripture which is in circulation in the church, but not acknowledged by all to be divine, to soften down a precept of this kind, the passage might be taken from The Shepherd, concerning some who as soon as they believe are put in subjection to Michael, but falling away from him from love of pleasure, are put in subjection to the angel of luxury, then to the angel of punishment, and after this to the angel of repentance;    location 182899

{1 Tim 3:1-2; 1 Tim 3:12; 1 Tim 5:9; Titus 1:5-6; We, Use of for Singular; Hermeneutics}
With regard to the legislation of the Apostle concerning church matters; for Paul wishes no one of those of the church, who has attained to any eminence beyond the many, as is attained in the administration of the sacraments, to make trial of a second marriage. For laying down the law in regard to bishops in the first Epistle to Timothy, he says, "If a man seeks the office of a bishop, he desires a good work. The bishop, therefore, must be without reproach, the husbands of one wife, temperate, sober-minded," etc.; and, in regard to deacons, "Let the deacons," he says, "be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well," etc.  . . . Yes, and also when appointing widows, he says, "Let there be no one as a widow under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man."    …

In the Epistle to Titus, . . . "If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, . . . Now, when we saw that some who have been married twice may be much better than those who have been married once, we were perplexed why Paul does not at all permit those who have been twice married to be appointed to church offices; for also it seemed to me that such a thing was worthy of examination, as it was possible that a man, who had been unfortunate in two marriages, and had lost his second wife while he was yet young, might have lived for the rest of his years up to old age in the greatest self-control and chastity. Who, then, would not naturally be perplexed why at all, when a ruler of the church is being sought for, we do not appoint such a man, though he has been twice married, because of the expressions about marriage? Yet, we lay hold of the man who has been once married as our ruler, even if he chance to have lived to old age with his wife, and sometimes may not have been disciplined in chastity and temperance?  . . . It is likely, therefore, also, that other arguments will be found by those who are wiser than we, and have more ability to see into such things, whether in the law about the bill of divorcement, or in the apostolic writings which prohibit those who have been twice married from ruling over the church or being preferred to preside over it. But, until something shall be found that is better and able by the excessive brilliancy of the light of knowledge to cast into the shade what we have uttered, we have said the things which have occurred to us in regard to the passages.

{Mt 19:8; Mt 5:32; Deut 24:1}
But perhaps some Jewish man of those who dare to oppose the teaching of our Savior will say, that when Jesus said, "Whoever shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, makes her an adulteress," (Matt. xix. 8) He also gave permission to put away a wife the same as Moses did, who was said by Him to have given laws for the hardness of heart of the people, and will hold that the saying, "Because he found in her an unseemly thing," is to be reckoned as the same as fornication, on account of which with good cause a wife could be cast away from her husband. But to him it must be said that, if she who committed adultery was according to the Law to be stoned, clearly it is not in this sense that the unseemly thing is to be understood. For it is not necessary for adultery or any such great indecency to write a bill of divorcement and give it into the hands of the wife. But indeed perhaps Moses called every sin an unseemly thing, on the discovery of which by the husband in the wife, as not finding favor in the eyes of her husband,    location 182951

After this our Savior says, not at all permitting the dissolution of marriages for any other sin than fornication alone, when detected in the wife. "Whoever shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, makes her an adulteress." But it might be a subject for inquiry if on this account He hinders anyone putting away a wife, unless she be caught in fornication, for any other reason, as for example for poisoning, or for the destruction during the absence of her husband from home of an infant born to them, or for any form of murder whatsoever. And further, if she were found despoiling and pillaging the house of her husband, though she was not guilty of fornication, one might ask if he would with reason cast away such a person, seeing that the Savior forbids anyone to put away his own wife saving for the cause of fornication. In either case there appears to be something monstrous. Whether it be really monstrous, I do not know. For to endure sins of such heinousness which seem to be worse than adultery or fornication, will appear to be irrational. Yet, on the other hand, everyone would acknowledge it to be impious to act contrary to the design of the teaching of the Savior.    location 182958

{Mt 5:32; Rom 7:3; Mt 19:9; Hermeneutics; 1 Cor 7:3-5}
Whoever shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, makes her an adulteress." For confessedly he who puts away his wife when she is not a fornicator, makes her an adulteress, so far as it lies with him, for if, "when the husband is living she shall be called an adulteress if she be joined to another man;" and when by putting her away, he gives to her the excuse of a second marriage, very plainly in this way he makes her an adulteress. But as to whether her being caught in the act of poisoning or committing murder, furnishes any defense of his dismissal of her, you can inquire yourselves. For the husband can also in other ways than by putting her away cause his own wife to commit adultery. For example, he may allow her to do what she wishes beyond what is fitting, and stooping to friendship with whatever men she wishes. For often from the naiveté of husbands, such false steps happen to wives. But whether there is a ground of defense or not for such husbands in the case of such false steps, you will inquire carefully and have to give your own opinion also in regard to the difficult questions raised by us on the passage.

If we believe the Scriptures, why at all do we emphasize the saying, "But they to whom it is given," but no longer pay attention to this: "Ask and it shall be given you," and to that which is added to it, "For everyone that asks receives"?

{Rom 1:1; Gal 4:6-7; Mt 11:29; 1 Cor 9:19; Lk 22:27; Phil 2:7}
 (1) "Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ."1 [Rom 1:1] We have already spoken about Paul. Now let us try to find out why he is called a slave here, seeing that elsewhere he writes, "For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back again into fear, but the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!'"2 And again, "Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his own Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!' So you are no longer a slave but a son."3 Why, therefore, does he declare himself to be a slave to people to whom he has previously said, "You are no longer a slave but a son"? We shall not be in error if we consider it to be an expression of that humility which the Lord taught when he said, "Learn from me, for I am meek and humble in heart."4 Nor is the truth of Paul's freedom violated by this. For he himself says, "For though I am free from all, I have made myself a slave to all."5 He serves Christ, then, not in a spirit of slavery but in the Spirit of adoption because being a slave of Christ is more distinguished than any freedom. Or it may be that he utters these words as an imitator of him who had said, "Behold I am among you not as one reclining at the table but as one who serves";6 and of him who "emptied himself, taking the form of a slave."7 Just as he himself becomes one under the Law for those who are under the Law.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 1, par. 1.

{1 Cor 7:21-23; 1 Cor 7:4-5; 1 Cor 7:15}
(2) When this same Apostle writes to the Corinthians and gives instructions about marriage and chastity, he inserts some things concerning freedom and slavery, as if on external authority, saying, "Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned. Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of it instead. For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise, whoever was free when called is a slave of Christ. You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men."9  [1 Cor 7] To at least some people these words appear to have been introduced illogically. For why is mention made of slavery and freedom in the midst of instructions about marriage and chastity? But we understand Paul's thought in this way: He is calling a man a slave who has been bound to the matrimonial state because "the wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does; and the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife does."10 This is why he says of them in another passage, "the brother or sister is not subjected to servitude in such cases";11 obviously because in other cases he would understand them to be subjected to servitude. Therefore a person who comes to Christ while married is called a slave, to whom he says, "Were you a slave when called? Do not let it be of consequence to you. Even if you can gain your freedom, make use of it instead."12 The reason he says this is because among married persons the freedom of continence of one partner can endanger the chastity of the other. For they are not obligated except by mutual consent for a time in order to be free for prayer. Then they ought to return again to the same lest Satan tempt them owing to their lack of self-control.13 Therefore he who has been called a slave on account of the marriage bond is the Lord's freedman. A freedman is neither entirely free nor is he entirely a slave. Consequently, he who is a slave owing to marriage, if he becomes free respecting the rest of the virtues, if he takes hold of the freedom of faith, patience, mercy, and 
righteousness, he is called the Lord's freedman, inasmuch as he is free for the sake of the virtues of his mind, and he is a slave for the sake of marital obligation. He is indeed free who comes to Christ without a wife through the purity of continence, however he is made a slave of Christ when he serves the virtues completely.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 1, par. 2.

{Phil 4:3; Rom 1:1}
 (3) Paul, then, if certain traditions are true, was called while in possession of a wife, concerning whom he speaks when writing to the Philippians, "I ask you also, my loyal mate, help these women."14 Since he had become free by mutual consent with her,15 he calls himself a slave of Christ. But if, as others think, he had no wife, nonetheless he who was free when he was called is yet a slave of Christ.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 1, par. 3.

{1 Cor 13:8-12; 1 Cor 7:2-3; 1 Cor 7:5; 1 Cor 7:9}
(4) But if it seems fitting, let us add this: Just as knowledge and prophecy and other gifts of the Holy Spirit17 which are now being given to the saints are given "in a mirror" and "in a riddle,"18 so also the freedom which is now offered to the saints is not yet full freedom but "as in a mirror and in a riddle,"19 and for this reason saints call themselves slaves in comparison with that freedom which shall be granted "face to face."20 For who is there placed in the flesh who is able to attain such complete freedom that he no longer serves the flesh in any respect whatsoever? In the same way it is not possible for someone who has been placed in a body to possess the adoption of sons completely.21 If only one could at least attain in this mortal life to this, that whoever completely becomes a slave of Christ would serve neither flesh, nor blood, nor vainglory, nor greed, nor wrath, nor envy, but Christ alone, that is to say, all the virtues simultaneously. These are the things concerning that which is written, "Paul, a slave of Jesus Christ."

{Rom 1:2; 1 Cor 7:7}
(1) Called to be an apostle.22 The word "called" can be viewed as a general term because it applies to all who believe in Christ. However each person individually is called either an apostle, prophet, teacher, a man free from a wife, or a slave to the marriage bond,23 according to what God foresees and chooses.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 2, par. 1.

{Mt 22:14; Mt 27:3-5; 1 Kings 13:1; 1 Cor 7:34}
 "Many are called but few are chosen,"24 is fulfilled. Nevertheless one should recognize that it is possible for someone to be a called apostle or a called prophet or a called teacher and, should he neglect the grace of his calling, to fall away from it. This is precisely what happened in the case of Judas, who had been called to be an apostle but, by neglecting the grace of his calling, changed from being an apostle to a traitor.25 He was indeed called to be an apostle but he was not chosen to be an apostle. Moreover the prophet who is reported in the Third Book of Kingdoms to have prophesied about Jeroboam was called to be a prophet. But whether he was also chosen you yourself must ascertain since, although forbidden to eat bread in Israel, he ate and was subsequently killed by a lion.26 There are also many called to be teachers in all of God's churches and called to be ministers, but I do not know who among them are chosen teachers and chosen ministers. In this way as well there are, in my opinion, certain people who are indeed called to suffer for Christ and yet they are not chosen. That is to say, they are called to be martyrs but are not chosen to be martyrs, since there are those who do not hold out to the end in the endurance of confession after the struggles of tortures and prisons. And there is also the virgin who is called but is not chosen a virgin, namely the one who will not be holy in body and spirit.27

(1) Set apart for the gospel of God.31 In Paul's case not only is a general calling to apostleship described32 but also a choosing according to the foreknowledge of God,33 which followed immediately, through which he is said to be set apart for the gospel of God. In this manner he says elsewhere about himself, "But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb, was pleased to reveal his Son in me."34
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 3, par. 1.

{Dan 13:42 [LXX]; Ps 58:3}
(2) But we maintain that Paul was not chosen due to chance or a special nature, but rather he himself gave the reasons for his own choosing as found in himself and in the One who "knows all things before they take place."37 Nor are the sinners who are set apart from the womb set apart by an unjust judgment. After all, look at the immediate context and see what the divine text says concerning them. For it is written, "They have been set apart as sinners from the womb; they have gone astray from their birth, they have spoken lies."38 If we understand in what sense sinners have gone astray from their mothers' wombs and have spoken lies, we shall equally understand at once that they are set apart from the womb deservedly. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 3, par. 2.

{Rom 1:1; Gal 1:15-16; Mt 6:8; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 11:23-27; 1 Cor 9:16; 1 Cor 9:27}
(3) It says then that Paul was set apart for the gospel and set apart from his own mother's womb. The reasons for this and the merits which entitled him to be set apart for this purpose were seen by the One from whom man's mind does not escape.39 For God foresaw that Paul was going to labor harder than all the others in the gospel;40 that, despite hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness, dangers from thieves, dangers from rivers, dangers at sea, he was going to preach the gospel of Christ,41 knowing that it would have been woe to him if he did not preach the gospel;42 and that he was going to punish his body and reduce it to slavery, so that, after proclaiming to others, he himself should not be rejected.43 Therefore, seeing in advance these things and many other similar things in him, God set Paul apart for the gospel from his mother's womb on account of these matters. For if, as the heretics think, he had been chosen either by uncertain fate or by the privilege of possessing a superior nature, surely he would never have expressed the fear that, if he were not to hold the restraints on his own body, it could potentially come to pass that he would be rejected44

{Attributes of God; Rom 8:29}
(4) After all, later in the letter he himself explains this more fully when he says, "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."46 Plainly showing that those whom God foreknew would become the kind to conform themselves to Christ by their sufferings, he even predestined them to be conformed and similar to his image and glory. Therefore there precedes a foreknowledge of them, through which is known what effort and virtue they will possess in themselves, and thus predestination follows, yet foreknowledge should not be considered the cause of predestination. For while men requite merit to each individual based upon past accomplishments, for God this is determined from future ones; and a person is very impious not to concede to God that what we see in the past he can see in the future.47  (p. 65)

(5) "Set part," he says, "for the gospel of God." . . . The evangelist Mark writes, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet."48 . . . Accordingly, the gospel of the Father is the gospel of the Son.

{Rom 1:2; Rom 10:15; Isa 52:7; Rom 10:18; Ps 19:4; Ps 147:15; Jer 23:4}
(1) "Which he promised through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures." . . .
For example, "The Lord shall give the word with much power to those who preach the gospel";77 and, "How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim the gospel tidings."78 Also regarding this is, "Their sound went forth in all the earth and their words unto the end of the world";79 and, "His word runs swiftly."80 There is also a promise of the gospel in Jeremiah, "Behold I am sending many shepherds81 and many hunters, and they shall catch them upon every mountain and upon every hill."82 This is what Paul is now speaking of when he says that God "promised [it] through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures."

{Rom 1:3}
(1) [Rufinus on Rom. 1:3]: Even though it is customary to find "predestined" in the Latin copies, the correct translation here is "destined" and not "predestined." . . . To be predestined applies to someone who is not yet in existence. . . . Accordingly those who do not yet exist can be foreknown and predestined, but He who is and who always is, is not predestined but destined.88  [See fn 88 on p. 69)

[The next discussion applies to the following passage from Rom 1:3,4]: concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,4 and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 5, par. 1.

{1 Thess 5:23; Mk 10:9; 1 Cor 1:30}
(3) it is my belief that the Apostle is using his customary habit in this passage,97 knowing that the soul is always midway between the spirit and the flesh and that it joins itself either to the flesh, thus becoming one with the flesh, or it associates itself with the spirit and becomes one with the spirit.98 Consequently if it is joined with the flesh men become fleshly; but if it unites with the spirit they become spiritual. And for that reason he does not explicitly designate the soul but only the flesh and the spirit. For he knows that the soul inevitably attaches itself to one of these two aspects. . . .. So then Paul, now aware that the soul of Jesus, united with the Lord and attaching to him, was one spirit of holiness with him, thus does not designate it explicitly lest he should break apart the unity of Jesus.102 For "what God has joined together let man not separate."103 He is in truth called the "spirit of holiness" according to the fact that he makes holiness available to all, just as it is written elsewhere about him, "who has become Wisdom for us from God, and Righteousness and Holiness and Redemption."10

{Rom 1:3; Mt 1:18; Num 36:8-9; Lk 1:36; Lk 1:5; Rom 9:3}
 (4) Still, some people105 attack us by raising the most aggravating questions. For example: How can Christ be descended from the seed of David when it is an established fact that he was not born of Joseph, in whom Joseph's lineage as a descendant of David is adduced?106 (pg. 71) . . . shall nevertheless be answered from our side: "Before Mary, who was betrothed, and Joseph came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit."107 Now according to the Law she was united to her own fellow tribe member and kinsman.108 And although it was told to her by the angel, "For behold Elizabeth your kinswoman shall herself give birth to a son in her old age";109 yet Elizabeth is said to be descended from the daughters of Aaron,110 nevertheless it will be affirmed on our side that the term "kinsman" may be appropriately and interchangeably applied not only to fellow tribe-members but also to everyone who are of the race of Israel. In this way the Apostle himself speaks likewise of all Israelites, "who are my kinsmen according to the flesh."111 These types of responses and others similar to them may be given.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 5, par. 4.

{Lk 2:33; Lk 2:48; Jn 1:45; Jn 6:42; Lk 17:1; Lev 12:4; Mt 1:8; 2 Kings 8:25; 2 Kings 11:2; 2 Kings 14:1; 2 Kings 15:1; 2 Kings 15:7; 2 Kings 15:32; 2 Kings 15:34; 1 Chr 3:11-12; 2 Kings 15:1}
(5) There is no problem in Joseph being called the father of Christ even though he is not at all his actual father.112 For it is also recorded by Matthew in the genealogy that Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah.113 Yet in the fourth book of Kingdoms it is written that Joram begat Ahaziah, and Ahaziah begat Joash, and Joash begat Amaziah. Amaziah in fact begat Azariah, who is sometimes called Uzziah, and Azariah begat Jotham.114 Hence Uzziah, who is also called Azariah, is said to be a son of Amaziah in the third115 book of Kingdoms,116 and yet in Matthew's account he is recorded as a son of Joram.117 Three generations in between have been skipped. . . .It suffices us for the moment to respond to those who oppose us that, just as Jesus is said to be a son of Joseph, from whom he was not generated, and Uzziah is said to be generated from Joram, from whom he was not generated, so also is it possible to understand that Christ was of David's seed according to the flesh.

{Rom 1:5; 1 Thess 2:5; 1 Cor 15:10}
(1) Through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of his name.132 He claims to have received grace and apostleship through Christ inasmuch as He is mediator of God and men.133
[My note: Here, "we" refers to Paul; it is used in the sense of "I."] "Grace" must refer to the endurance of labors, "apostleship" to the authority of proclamation. . . . He also gives grace to his own apostles with which they may say as they labor, "I have labored harder than all of them; but not I but the grace of God with me."138
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 7, par. 1.

{Rom 1:7; Gen 9:26-27}
(1) To all God's beloved in Rome: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.146 In my opinion, this blessing of peace and grace which the Apostle Paul bestows on God's beloved to whom he is writing is nothing less than the blessing given by Noah to Shem and Japheth147 which has been fulfilled through the Spirit in those who have been blessed.148  . . . Therefore I regard the blessing with which the Apostle blessed the churches of Christ not inferior to any of these other blessings. (p. 76)
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 8, par. 1.

{Rom 1:8; 1 Cor 1:2; Gal 1:6}
(1) First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.161 When writing to certain people the Apostle says he gives thanks for all of them, as he does now in writing to the Romans. However when he writes to others he indeed gives thanks but does not add the words, "for all." You shall discover if you look carefully that when he says he gives thanks "for all" he does not amplify on particular faults or serious charges of disgraceful conduct among them; but when he singles out certain people or makes an accusation he does not add to the thanksgiving that he gives thanks "for all." This is the case in the letters to the Corinthians and to the Colossians.162 Indeed in Galatians he does not write a thanksgiving at all because he is amazed at them that they are "so quickly turning away from him who called them unto another gospel."163 
(p. 77)
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 9, par. 1.

{Rom 1:8; Heb 7:24-26}
(2) Thus his first expression in this letter starts with a word of thanksgiving. Now to give thanks to God is to offer a sacrifice of praise; and for that reason he adds, "through Jesus Christ," as through a great high priest.164 For whoever wants to offer a sacrifice to God should know that he must offer it through the hands of a high priest.165 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 9, par. 2.

{Rom 1:8}
(6) We take note, of course, that to the word "first" he does not relate anything like, "and in the second place."177 However we said in the Preface178 that Paul's style of speaking is incomplete.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 9, par. 6.

{Rom 1:9; Isa 43:10; Acts 1:8; Mt 10:32}
(1) For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness.180 God is a witness for his saints since they also are witnesses of God according to what he says through the prophet, "You shall be my witnesses and I am a witness, says the Lord."181 Moreover the Savior says to the disciples, "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and Samaria, and to all the ends of the earth,"182 according to which it is written, "Everyone who confesses me, I also will confess him before my Father."183 

[David's Note: Our Bibles translate this as: "For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers. [NKJ] By breaking the sentence the way the early Christians understood it, Paul is not making an oath. He is not calling God as his witness.]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 10, par. 1.

{Rom 1:9; Jn 4:23-24; 1 Thess 5:23}
(2) Let us now see why it is that he says, "whom I serve in my spirit." To serve in the spirit seems to me to be similar to, yes and even something more than, to worship in the spirit.184 As the Lord himself said to the Samaritan, "Woman, the hour will come, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth."185 But Paul not only worships in the spirit, but he also serves in the spirit. . . . Accordingly the Apostle serves God not in the body or in the soul but in his best part, in the spirit. For when he writes to the Thessalonians he makes known that these three aspects are in man when he says, "May your whole body, soul, and spirit be preserved on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."186 And Daniel says, "Praise the Lord you spirits and souls of the righteous."187
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 10, par. 2.

{2 Cor 3:6; Rom 8:3; Rom 7:14}
 "The letter kills but the spirit gives life."188 But also when he says, "For where the Law was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,"189 doubtless he is calling the "flesh of the Law" the "letter of the Law." For through the letter the Law is weak so that it may not be fulfilled.190 For who could fulfill what is written about the Sabbath, "You shall not move from your place on the Sabbath"?191 . . . Or what about the laws concerning leprous diseases that break out on thread or on a wall or on a hide or the thousands of other laws?192 It is on account of these laws that the Law is weak according to the letter, that is, according to the flesh. For that reason, the Apostle says, "For the Law is spiritual."193
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 10, par. 2.

{Rom 1:10; 1 Thess 5:17}
(1) How without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, asking that by God's will I may somehow at last at some time have a successful journey in coming to you.199 When Paul says that he prays without ceasing for those to whom he is writing, being mindful of his own command, he fulfills in deed what he has commanded in word.200

{Rom 1:11-12}
(1)  He says, For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.203 First of all, we must learn that to long to see Christian brothers is an apostolic work, but for no other reason except that we might confer to them some spiritual gift if we are able and, if we are not able, that we might receive one from them.
203. Rom. 1:11-12
(pg. 81)
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 12, par. 1.

{Rom 1:13-15}
(1.) I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you but thus far have been prevented, in order that I may have some fruit even among you as also among the other nations, the Greeks and barbarians, the wise and foolish, I am a debtor; thus for my part I am eager to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in Rome.210 There is a hyperbaton211 in this passage and it is a rhetorical ellipsis. [hyperbaton means a transposition of words from their natural order.] We can render the hyperbaton as follows: "I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you in order that I may have some fruit both among you as also among the other nations, the Greeks and barbarians, the wise and foolish, but thus far I have been prevented." But the rhetorical ellipsis may be completed in the following way: In the place where he says, "also among the other nations, the Greeks and barbarians, the wise and foolish," it appears that the words "to whom" are missing. What follows should read this way, "to whom I am a debtor." The logical order might be, "Just as I have fruit among the other nations, the Greeks and barbarians, the wise and foolish, to whom I am a debtor, thus for my part I am eager to proclaim the gospel to you also who are in Rome; for I have never been ashamed to preach the gospel among any nation because the power of God is in it for salvation to all who believe, first for the Jew and then for the Greek."212 
Rom. 1:13-15
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 12, par. 1.

{Rom 1:17}
(1 con't) For in the gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed which had been concealed previously, being hidden in the Law. But it is revealed to those who go from the faith of the old covenant to the new faith of the gospel; just as it was predicted in the prophet: The "righteous," even if he is still under the Law, by believing in God and in his servant Moses,213 "lives out of faith."214 And when he comes to the gospel from the faith of the Law he is led to faith in Christ and thus advances from faith to faith.215  
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 12, par. 1.

{Rom 1:13; Acts 16:7}
(2) These things should be said as far as pertains to the logical coherence of the words of the Apostle. But now, let us investigate what contributes to understanding. He shows his love for the Romans when he says, "For I have often intended to come to you." If we think that what he adds, "but thus far I have been prevented," means that he has been prevented by God, it is shown through this as well that it matters to God where each of the apostles ought to go or not to go, and that by a kind of superintendence he allows the word of God to be preached to some but prevents it from being preached to others. As he says elsewhere, "And when we tried to enter into Bithynia the Spirit of Jesus prevented us."216
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 12, par. 2.

{Rom 1:13; 1 Thess 2:18; Rom 1:10}
(3) However, if "but thus far I have been prevented" is related to what he says in another passage, "Satan hindered us,"218 then he is suitably revealing here that he is struggling without ceasing in prayer219 in order that, when the hindrances of Satan have been overcome, his journey might become successful by the will of God to see those who are in Rome.

{Rom 1:14; 1 Cor 2:2}
(3) It is as if Paul, desirous of great wealth and returning from his many spiritual investments, longs to gather in. He gathers fruit from the Greeks, he gathers some from the barbarians, he gathers some from the wise, and he even collects some from the foolish.220 Whereas he speaks wisdom to some as to the perfect, to others as to the foolish, he claims to know nothing at all except Christ Jesus and him crucified.221 Whereas he teaches some out of the Law and the prophets, others he convinces by signs and wonders.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 12, par. 3.

{Jn 15:1-9}
(4) Truly Paul bears all these fruits because like a good branch he remains in the true vine, who is Christ. He whom the Father, as the vine grower, frequently prunes, also for that reason bears much fruit;222 but he prunes him through labors, afflictions, and persecutions. For there are other branches who abide in the vine but do not bear fruit but are withered. From these are the ones which remain in Christ in name but in works and deeds are found unfruitful and withered. They are said to be cut off by the Father and cast into the fire.223 For the first Adam was a type of vine224 and the root of the human race which produced certain fruitful branches, such as Seth, Enosh, Enoch, and the rest until Noah, but he produced others which were unfruitful and useless, such as Cain and all the offspring generated from him. Likewise in Christ, who is the last Adam,225 there are some fruitful branches that are bearing fruit in the true vine, but also others that are withered and should be cut off by the Father, the vine grower.226

{Rom 1:13; Gal 5:22; Gal 5:19; Mt 13:44}
 (5) Note the following as well: the Apostle designates the fruit of good things in the singular, just as he does in another passage, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace";227 but the works of the flesh which he reproaches he mentions in the plural.228 
he should realize this: Just as the man who dealt with many pearls but who discovered one of very great value sold everything and bought that one pearl,230 in the same way someone who begins with many fruits ought to strive for the one fruit of perfection.231

{Rom 1:14; 1 Cor 14:18}
(6) [Rom. 1:14]  At this point it must be asked in what sense the Apostle is a debtor to Greeks and barbarians, to the wise and foolish. For what had he received from them which would cause him to be indebted to them? In my opinion he has become a debtor to the various nations because, through the grace of the Holy Spirit, he had received the ability to speak in the tongues of all the nations, as he himself says, "I speak in more tongues than all of you."232 Accordingly, since a person receives the knowledge of tongues not for his own sake but for the sake of those to whom he is supposed to preach, he becomes a debtor to all those, the knowledge of whose language he has received from God.

{Rom 1:16}
(1) For I am not ashamed of the gospel; for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.238 to the Jew first and also to the Greek." . . . For although the Greeks may have named all the rest of humanity living without laws as barbarians (since the Greeks themselves did make use of laws), the Apostle rightly puts the Jews ahead of the Greeks since they began to live under laws before the Greeks.247 Moreover their laws were promulgated by God, rather than men.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 14, par. 1.

{Rom 1:17; Hab 2:4}
(1) For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith.248  . . . But concerning the words "from faith to faith" we have already said above250 that the first people who had believed God and his servant Moses251 were also in the faith; from this faith they now transfer over to the faith of the gospel.252 But it says this from the testimony of the prophet Habakkuk, "the righteous lives by my faith."253 Either it means that he who is under the Law must believe in the Gospels as well, or that he who is under the Gospels must also believe in the Law and the Prophets. For a person does not possess complete life who has one but not the other.254 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 15, par. 1.

{Rom 1:18; Rom 1:21-23}
(1) For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth. Because what is known of God has been manifested to them, for God has manifested it to them.255  . . . He says that what is known about God is manifest to them. This shows that there is something about God that may be known and something about him that may not be known. That is why he says the wrath of God is being revealed to those who suppress the truth by their wickedness. What is revealed is brought forth from obscurity and hiddenness into the state of being known. Since therefore it is said here as well that the wrath of God is revealed from heaven not against those who are ignorant of the truth but against those who hold fast to it, although they hold fast to it in a bad way, evidently he is saying that the rationale for and knowledge of the wrath of God are manifested in those who know the truth, even though they suppress it in wickedness.257 As he declares in what follows, this is interpreted as having been spoken about the wise men of this world and the scholars and the philosophers. Although they knew the truth and righteousness of God, "they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became bankrupt in their thinking," having turned to idols.258 And "claiming to be wise, they became fools," for "they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of the image of man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles."259 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 16, par. 1.

{General Revelation; Rom 1:18}
(2) With these words the Apostle also makes known the following: That which the wise men of this world have attained in respect to the knowledge of the truth, they have attained as God reveals them. But as long as they strive for vain glory or fawn over ancient errors or become intimidated by fear of the rulers, they themselves become the judges of their own damnation. The truth which they had known by divine revelation they either covered up when they denied the existence of freedom or they rejected through the wickedness of their deeds.260

{Rom 1:18; 2 Sam 24:1; Ps 78:49; Rom 2:5; Rom 2:15; Job 20:23}
(3) Well then, wrath sometimes seems to refer to that power which governs the ministers of punishments and inflicts penalties which govern sinners.261 I hold the view that this is the meaning of the text which reports that the wrath of God incited David to command Joab to take a census of the people.262 Moreover both his ministers and associates are also indicated in the passage which says, "He sent against them the wrath of his fury, affliction, and wrath through evil angels."263 Sometimes even the pangs of conscience are named wrath264 when we clarify "avengers" and "punishers," as the Apostle also says, "you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath";265 and in another passage, "as their thoughts among them mutually accuse or even defend them on the day when God will judge the secrets of men."266 Moreover the affliction of distress or of a trial is called the wrath of God, [M863] as Job says, "The wrath of the Lord is in my body."267 

FN.: Job 6.4. The LXX reads, "For the arrows of the Lord are in my body, whose wrath drinks my blood." Thus Origen has accurately perceived the sense, but not the wording, of the verse.

{Rom 1:19}
 (6) "For what is known of God has been manifested to them, because God has manifested it to them."274 We have already said above275 that what we are able to comprehend by the progression of this world and by reason is "known of God." This is what the Apostle himself indicates when he says that his invisible things can be contemplated through the things which have been made.276 However the knowledge of his substance and nature must be understood to be a matter that is "unknown of God."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 16, par. 6.

{Rom 1:20-23}
(1) For his invisible things are perceived from the creation of the world, having been understood through what has been made, and his eternal power and deity, so that they might be without excuse; for though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became bankrupt in their thinking, and their foolish heart was darkened. For claiming to be wise, they became fools and they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of the image of corruptible man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.279 In what has been said above we have already discussed nearly all the details of these verses.
. . . For what is so revolting, so dark, and so gloomy as to turn the glory of God into the bodily and corruptible effigy of a human form, as is the custom of those who worship images; to equate the greatness of the divine majesty with birds and four-footed animals and reptiles?

(1) It was assuredly for these reasons that God most justly handed them over to the desires of their hearts to impurity, to the mutual degrading of their bodies; they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever.287
. . . These were the desires of their heart: that they mutually devote their own bodies to impurity and defilement. And the kind of judgment they used against the veneration of the deity when they transferred the glory of the incorruptible God to disgusting and unworthy forms of men and animals was the same judgment they used in turn against themselves, that rational human beings live after the fashion of irrational beasts.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 1.

{Rom 1:24}
(2) The Apostle says, namely that God "handed them over to the desires of their heart to impurity, to the degrading of their bodies"? For in this not only will their system, once completely excluded, be forced out, but even our own explanation. For how shall it be just that whoever is handed over-granted that it is on account of their own sins that they are handed over-nonetheless are handed over to lusts and handed over to this, to the devotion of their own bodies to impurities and lusts? For example, anyone who is handed over to the dungeon for punishment cannot be charged with the accusation that he is in darkness. Or, anyone handed over to fire cannot, for this very reason, be blamed for why he is burnt. Likewise in the case of those who are handed over to sinful desires and impurities so that they degrade their bodies, it will not seem fitting for them to be charged when, situated amongst lusts and impurities, they defile their bodies with degradations. [Note: Origen is stating this as a problem, but then he gives the solution below.]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 2.

{1 Thess 5:23; Gal 5:17; Gen 6:3; Rom 8:9}
(5) We frequently find in the Scriptures, and we have often discussed this topic, that man may be said to be spirit, body, and soul.294 And when it is said, "The flesh desires contrary to the spirit, and the spirit desires contrary to the flesh,"295 the soul is undoubtedly placed in the middle. Either it gives assent to the desires of the spirit or it is inclined toward the lusts of the flesh. If it joins itself to the flesh it becomes one body with it in its lust and sinful desires;296 but if it should associate itself with the spirit it shall be one spirit with it. It is after all for this reason that the Lord says in the Scriptures concerning those whose souls had been united completely with the flesh, "My Spirit shall no longer abide in these men, for they are flesh."297 But concerning those whose soul had united with the spirit the Apostle says, "But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit."298
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 5.

{Eph 6:12; Gal 5:17; Mt 18:10; Heb 1:14}
(6) Moreover, as we find in many scriptural passages, there are angels who are patrons and helpers for both sides, or rather for the two ways.299 For the devil and his angels and all the evil spirits in the heavenly regions together with all the principalities and powers and rulers of the infernal parts of this world against whom human beings must do battle300 support the flesh in its lust against the spirit.301 But on the other hand, all the good angels support the spirit as it struggles against the flesh and attempt to summon the human soul, which is intermediate, to itself. The Lord says about these angels, "Their angels see the face of your Father in heaven."302 The Apostle also speaks about them in Hebrews,303 "Are they not all ministering spirits sent to serve for the sake of those who are receiving the inheritance of salvation?"304
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 6.

{Free Will; Deut 30:15; 1 Cor 15:26}
(7) But out of both sides' support, the duty of choice is preserved. For the matter is not done by force nor is the soul moved in either of the two directions by compulsion.306 Otherwise neither blame nor virtue could be ascribed to it, nor would the choice of the good earn a reward or the turning aside to evil merit punishment. Instead the freedom of will is preserved in the soul in all things, so that it may turn to what it wants, just as it is written, "See, I have set before you life and death,"307 "fire and water."308 Life, therefore, is Christ,309 and death refers to the last enemy,310 the devil. The soul therefore makes its own decision whether it wants to choose life, that is Christ, or to turn aside to death, the devil.311 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 7.

{Rom 1:21}
(8) But suppose the soul, while recognizing God, should fail to embrace Christ, its life. Suppose it should not honor him as God or give thanks, but should become bankrupt in its thinking. . . . If that should happen it shall doubtlessly be forsaken and abandoned by those beings which, by their support, were encouraging it to be joined with the spirit. They withdraw from it or hand it over to the desires of its own heart, by which it is united and joined to the flesh. Certainly they shall not call back a soul which is resisting or reluctant to the things which it has avoided and spurned. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 8.

{1 Thess 5:23; Rom 1:25}
(9) If the depiction of this matter still seems unclear, let us make it less obscure and more plain by using an illustration.312 Let us imagine that there is a certain home in which the soul dwells together with the body and the spirit, as it were with a pair of counselors. In front of the entrance of this home stands piety and all the virtues with her. But on the other side are ungodliness and every sort of excess and lust. They are all waiting for a nod from the soul: Which of these two troops watching before her doors does she want to have let in to herself, which does she want to repel? Suppose the soul, in compliance with the spirit and yielding to the better counselor, summons to herself the troop led by piety and modesty. Will not the other group which has been spurned and repudiated go away? But suppose the soul, yielding to the counsels of the flesh, lets into her home the ungodly lust-squad. Then that whole crowd, led by holiness and piety, over which the soul preferred the counsel of the evils, shall withdraw with righteous indignation and leave the soul to the sinful desires of her own heart. The result will be that she degrade her own bodies among herself. The soul has exchanged the truth of God for a lie and, letting into herself the servants of ungodliness and faithlessness, worships and serves the creature instead of the Creator, who is blessed forever.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 9.

{Jn 14:23; 1 Cor 6:19-20}
(10) As members of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit let us preserve our bodies [M868] in all holiness and purity so that they might become worthy not only for angels to enter but indeed also to be a habitation of the Holy Spirit and a dwelling place of the Father and the Son, who said of the one who abides in his commands, "I and the Father will come and make a dwelling place with him."315 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 18, par. 10.

{Rom 1:26; Rom 1:28}
(2) For the third time we find it formulated by the Apostle, "God handed them over." He gave the following as reasons for the first "handing over": "For though they knew God, they did . . . And those who had known God's righteousness, that those who practice such things deserve to die, not only do these things but even consent with those who practice them. And therefore, on account of all these evils, they will be without excuse when they judge and condemn others for the crimes they themselves practice. For such a person is making a pronouncement about himself when he punishes another for the things which he himself commits.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 19, par. 2.

{Rom 1:26; Rom 1:28}
(5) Second, if someone, who although he has known God, should not honor him as God or give thanks but should be such as the apostolic discourse describes in detail, it is scarcely to be doubted that the soul of such a person has been forsaken by God and handed over. For it is not possible for God to have a dwelling with these evils or for these evils to proceed from a place where God dwells.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 19, par. 5.

{Rom 1:23; 1 Cor 3:16}
(7) the one who is already a believer who defiles the temple of God325 is guilty of a greater sacrilege than a profane man who defiles the temple of idols.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 19, par. 7.
Cf. Ps 73.8ff. See 2.14.11. 

{Rom 1:23; Gen 1:27; Col 3:9-10; Eph 4:22-24; Rom 7:22; 2 Cor 4:16}
(8) Obviously the passage in which the Apostle says, "they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of the image of man," must not be left behind.326 This text must be understood as exposing not merely those who worship idols, but also as refuting the anthropomorphites who are in the Church, who claim that the image of God is the bodily form of man. They are aware that it is written in the book of Genesis that man was made in the image of God.327 Now of which man this text ought to be understood, the Apostle himself explains when he says, "having laid aside the old man with his deeds," and, "having put on the new who has been created according to God."328 You hear that he says that the new man is created according to God. But in another passage he calls this same new man "the inner man."329 In fact he identifies the corruptible man, whose image he rejects, as the outer man when he says, "Even though our outer man is being corrupted, our inner man is being renewed."330 And in order that those who are in error concerning the image of God might know his meaning still more clearly, let them hear which one the Apostle says is the man who has been created in the image of God. He writes in Colossians, "Do not lie, seeing that you have stripped off your old man with his deeds and have put on the new, who is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of him who created him."331 From these words he plainly shows that it is the inner man, which is being renewed through knowledge, who has been created in the image of God. But those who say that the outer man, that is, the bodily and corruptible man, is in the image of God are, by the Apostle, in company with those who have exchanged the glory of God for the likeness of the image of corruptible man.332
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 1, ch. 19, par. 8.

{Rom 1:32; Mt 7:17-20}
(1) But we know that god's judgment on those who do such things is in accordance with truth.1
I wish to point out in this instance as well how great the truth of his judgment is. By common acknowledgment a good man ought not be punished, nor should an evil one obtain good things. Therefore, if, for instance, someone has done evil at some time, it is certain that he was evil at that time when he was doing evil things. However, suppose he, repenting of his past deeds, reforms his mind toward good things, behaves well, speaks well, thinks well, and turns his will toward the good. Is it not clear to you that he who does these things is a good man who deserves to receive good things? In like manner if someone should convert from good to evil, he shall no longer be judged as the good man he was and is no longer, but as the evil man that he is. You see, deeds pass away, whether good or evil.9 According to their own characteristics, they represent and form the mind of the one who is doing them; and they leave it either good or evil, to be devoted to either punishment or rewards.10 Accordingly it shall be unjust to punish a good mind for evils committed or to reward an evil mind for good deeds. [My note: this also has application to good tree/good fruit parable of Jesus]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 1, par. 1

{Rom 2:1; Rom 2:12}
(1) Do you think, O man, all you who judge those who do such things and do them, that you will escape the judgment of God?14 If "everything the law says it speaks to those who are under the law,"15 then also the things the gospel or the Apostle is now saying are being said not to the rulers of the world or to the kings of the earth but to those who lead and govern the churches, that is to say, to those who judge those who are inside the Church,16 i.e., to the bishops and elders and deacons. So then, Paul is saying to them that they should not think they will escape the judgment of God if they themselves commit the very things over which they judge and condemn others. It is therefore needful for each one first to judge his own conscience and only then to examine the deeds of the one whom he is judging. Would that this would take place! Then all secret ambition for striving after ecclesiastical offices would immediately be cut off. Would that those who want to lead the people would consider themselves as persons to be judged rather than as those who are about to pass judgment! 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 2, par. 1.

{Rom 2:1; Ps 139:7}
(2) Let no one think then that he can escape God's judgment. As the prophet says, "Where shall I go from your Spirit and where shall I flee from your presence?"17
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 2, par. 2.

{Rom 2:4}
(1) Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and patience, unaware that God's goodness leads you to repentance?23  . . . What might I say about men's deceits, violence, crime, sacrileges, and wicked actions? Yet in this passage those who, while judging others, themselves commit the things which they punish in others, seem to be put ahead of all these others in wickedness.28 If then someone despises this goodness of God and his forbearance and patience, he does not realize that it is by means of these that he is being invited to repentance.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 3, par. 1.

{Rom 2:4}
(2) Forbearance seems to differ from patience. Those who commit a transgression out of weakness rather than out of deliberate intention are said to be "forborne"; those, however, who, as it were, gloat over their transgressions with an obstinate mind must be said to be "endured with patience." . . . So then, God bears with everyone patiently and awaits each one's repentance; but this should not render us negligent or make us slow to conversion, since there is a definite measure to his patience and forbearance.33
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 3, par. 2.

{Rom 2:5-6; Mt 6:19-20}
(2) But now we must endeavor to ascertain what he says, "you are storing up a treasury of wrath for yourself." It is called a "treasury" where wealth and riches of various kinds are collected. We read of three meanings of this term in the Scriptures. In the Gospel it is said that there is a certain treasury on earth where the Lord forbids treasures to be stored up; there is another treasury in heaven where he commands all the faithful to lay up their wealth;41 and now here the Apostle speaks of treasuries of wrath. Therefore all men collect into one treasury out of these three through the things they do in this world. For it is the unbeliever who, being wicked and by the hardness of his heart and his impenitent heart, lays up his own deeds in the treasury of wrath.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 4, par. 2.

{Rom 2:5-6; Lk 8:17; Lk 12:2; Rom 2:15-16; Isa 26:20}
(4) The Apostle adds to "the day of wrath" [the phrase,] "and of revelation." He puts it this way, "on the day of wrath and revelation of God's righteous judgment." In the Gospel it is also made known that everything is going to be revealed when it is said, "Nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing covered up that will not be revealed."58 Moreover, later in this epistle the Apostle says, "as their thoughts accuse or even defend them on the day when God will judge the secrets of men."59. . . At that time it will be said to the saints, "Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your door to hide yourselves for a little while until the fury of my wrath is past."62
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 4, par. 4.

{Deut 29:29; Rom 2:16}
(6) Now whether those who are disembodied or the saints who are now with Christ do anything and labor on our behalf in imitation of the angels who attend to the service of our salvation;68 or, on the other hand, whether even sinners, themselves without bodies, do anything in accordance with the intention of their own mind in no less imitation of the evil angels with whom they are to be cast into the eternal fire, as was indeed said by Christ;69 let this too be kept among the hidden things of God.7
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 4, par. 6.

{Rom 2:5-6}
(7) Let them hear that God pays back to each one-not on account of his nature--but on account of his works. In the second place let believers be edified so as to not entertain the thought that, because they believe, this alone can suffice for them.72 On the contrary they should know that God's righteous judgment pays back to each one according to his own works. Obviously, because he says here that there is a righteous judgment of God, so that it will be paid back to each one according to his works,73 the Gentiles will in nowise seem to be excluded when they themselves do good and behave correctly. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 4, par. 7.

{Mt 13:44}
(8) For not even the treasure hidden in the field is found by all, lest it be easily plundered and perish.77 Yet it is found by those who are prudent, who are able to go and sell everything they have and buy that field.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 4, par. 8.

{Rom 2:7-10; Eph 6:12; Lk 21:19}
(3) He says, "To those who by perseverance in good works." When he says, "perseverance in good works," he is pointing out that certain exertions and struggles are close at hand for those who want to do good works.83 For as the same Apostle says, "Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities and powers and rulers of this world,"84 all of which are opposed to good works. This is why perseverance is necessary,85 for it is written, "By your perseverance you will gain your souls."86 [Lk 21:19]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 3.

{Mt 17:3; Lk 9:30; 2 Cor 3:16}
(4) There exists another glory which remains95 and is glorified in Christ. For when he had ascended the mountain with Peter, James, and John, it is written that he was transformed in glory. It says, "And then Moses and Elijah appeared, speaking with him."96 This shows that when Jesus was transformed into glory, the glory of the Law and the Prophets then appeared, so that prophecy and law, illuminated by Christ's glory, could be understood in the spirit, once the veil of the letter had been taken out of the way.97
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 4.

{Ex 40:34; Heb 1:3}
 (5) In fact it is even said in Exodus that the glory of God filled the tabernacle of testimony;98 and no less again at the dedication of the temple the glory of God descended and filled the house with a dark smoke and clouds,99 in which, it is scarcely to be doubted, the very presence of God is indicated as having arrived. In these passages, this must be considered to be the glory about which the Apostle is speaking when writing to the Hebrews concerning the Son, "For he is the splendor of his glory and the express image of his substance."100 In these things it is made clear that the source of glory is the Father himself, from whom the splendor of that glory, the Son, is generated,101 by participation in whom all creatures are said to have glory. . . . And so the one who searches for this glory and honor and incorruption through perseverance in good works will attain to eternal life. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 5.

{Ps 49:12}
(6) But now that we have discussed "glory" as well as we could, let us see what "honor" refers to, since those who hasten to eternal life seek not only glory but also honor. It is written, "When man was in honor he did not understand; he was likened to foolish beasts and became like them."104 So then, he seeks that honor which he had before he was likened to foolish beasts, that is to say, that honor which he had in Paradise before he transgressed it, the honor by which he earned the right to hear the voice of God, the honor by which he enjoyed the fruits of Paradise and the tree of life.105
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 6.

{Rom 13:7}
(6 cont.) The Apostle says later, "Pay to all what is due them, honor to whom honor is due."106 . . . For this is how I understand the honor which is due to be paid if something owed to justice is paid back and no part of it is conceded to injustice.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 6.

{1 Cor 1:30; Mt 27:30; Mk 15:19}
(6 cont.) And though Christ is justice and sanctification and truth,108 you will be like those who struck Christ with their fists and spat in his face and, beating his head with the cane, placed the crown of thorns on his brow.109
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 6.

{Rom 1:23; Rom 2:7; 1 Cor 3:17; 2 Cor 11:3}
(7) Now precisely what the term "incorruption" means we shall quickly learn if we investigate what is its opposite. The opposite of incorruption is corruption. Corruption is said to happen in two ways: bodily and spiritually. It happens bodily when that which is written comes to pass, "If anyone corrupts God's temple, God will corrupt him."112 It takes place in a spiritual sense when that happens which the Apostle no less says, "But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by its cunning, your understanding will be corrupted from the simplicity of faith in Christ Jesus."113 So then, when a person remains uncorrupted in body and spirit from the things which we have mentioned above, he is said to seek incorruption. The goal of this, of course, is that through the incorruption of his outward performance [of the virtues] he may deserve to attain to the incorruption of the resurrection.114 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 5, par. 7.

{Rom 2:7-8}
(1) But for those who out of contention and who distrust the truth but believe in wickedness--wrath and fury, affliction and anguish.118
. . .He says, "He will pay back eternal life to those who by perseverance in good works seek glory and honor." Yet to those "who out of contention comply with wickedness," he did not say "wrath and fury" so as to be attached to the phrase "he will pay back," as he had said earlier. Instead he [simply] says, "wrath and fury, affliction and anguish." From this, anyone who is spiritual and understands what the Spirit would say through Paul would say that the Apostle has written these things not through a lack of skill but rather through divine skill.124 He is undoubtedly trying to communicate here that to those who, by perseverance in good works, seek glory and incorruption, what must be paid back, namely eternal life, is paid back by God. But the other things are not given by God, i.e., those things which come upon those who, out of contention, distrust the truth but comply with wickedness. For God's gifts are absolutely abiding and worthy of him. But as a consequence of their own deeds for those who practice evil there will be wrath and fury, affliction and anguish, in accordance with what they have treasured up for themselves. For surely just as he had earlier used the words "eternal life" as a direct object, here he would also have used "wrath, fury, affliction, and anguish" as direct objects had he wanted it to refer to the person of God as the one who pays back.125 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 6, par. 1.

{Rom 2:8; 1 Sam 2:30; Isa 50:11}
(2) This distinction [see note on Rom. 2:8] is also given expression in other passages of Scripture. For instance in the First Book of Kingdoms the Lord says, "Those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be despised."126 In this passage the Lord is clearly revealed to say that those who are to be honored are going to be honored through himself; but of those who are going to be despised he has not referred this to himself but has merely said that they shall be despised. For if God were to pay back evil through himself in the same way that he supplies good things through himself, according to reason he would have said, "And those who despise me I shall despise," just as he said, "Those who honor me I will honor."127 Moreover, something similar to this seems to be shown by the prophet in another passage where those who enter into fire discover that it has been kindled not by God but by themselves. As Isaiah says, "Go in the light of your fire, and in the flame which you have kindled!"128 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 6, par. 2.

{Rom 2:7}
(3) In order that the explanation of these things might become even clearer, let the following be added.129 Suppose someone, going against a physician's orders by consuming the juice of rotten food, after the agitation of his body's temperature, incurs a fever or whatever sickness you like. Obviously it is not through the physician but rather through his own lack of discipline that this person contracted this pestilential sickness. Suppose, on the other hand, that by observing the physician's orders the man remains in health. In that case, he would be said to possess the gift of health through the physician. It is in this way then that God himself will seem to consequently pay back [those who persevere].
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 6, par. 3.

{Rom 2:8; Isa 5:21}
 (4) One should realize that one of the diseases of the soul, indeed the worst one, is contention. Through it every depraved deed is committed. Through it heresies are born, through it schisms and all scandals in the churches are produced, so long as those "who are prudent among themselves and wise in their own eyes"132 defend as law whatsoever pleases them.133 And so it happens that a person is made distrustful of the truth and compliant with wickedness. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 6, par. 4.

{Rom 2:8}
(5) [Comment from Rufinus]: On the other hand, "to distrust" is usually found in the Holy Scriptures with the meaning "not to believe" or "not to comply with." This is how it is used in this passage which, in my opinion, the Latin scholar134 could have more appropriately translated if he would have said, "who do not obey the truth but obey wickedness."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 6, par. 5.

{Jn 14:6}
(5 cont.) No one then who travels down a road which is alien from the truth is following Him who said, "I am the truth."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 6, par. 5.

{Rom 2:9; Rom 3:2; Bar 4:4; Lk 12:47-48; Rom 1:20}
(1) But why are wrath and fury for the Jew first and for the Greek?149 Because both glory and honor are themselves first [to the Jews], "For the oracles of God were first entrusted to them."150 And they themselves say, "Blessed are we, O Israel, for we know what is pleasing to God."151 For this reason, then, the statement in the Gospel applies here, "That slave who knew the will of his master and did things deserving of punishment will receive a severe beating."152 This refers to the Jew. "But the one who did not know," the Greek, i.e., the Gentile, "will receive a light beating."153 For there is a difference between knowing God and knowing God's will. God could be known even by the Gentiles "from the creation of the world through the things that have been made, and through his eternal power and deity."154 His will, however, is not known except from the Law and the Prophets.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 7, par. 1.

{Mt 20:16; Lk 13:30; Mt 23:38; Mt 21:19; Mt 16:26; Gen 25:23; Gen 12:3}
(2) Since the Apostle puts the Jews first for punishment and reward and places the Greeks after them, it should be investigated whom he wants us to understand by "Jews" and "Greeks." If he is calling them Jews who are still under the law and do not yet come to Christ, and he calls the Christians Greeks, i.e., believing Gentiles, then it would seem to go against the idea of the entire mystery.155 For how could they be called first, about whom it has been said, "Behold the first shall be last,"156 and to whom he further says, "Behold your house shall be left to you desolate"?157 Moreover, when the Savior approached the fig tree on which he did not find fruit he said, "Never again will fruit be born from you!"158 Furthermore, in the womb of Rebecca two peoples were signified, of whom it is said, "the elder shall serve the younger";159 and it was the younger who receives the blessings of the first born.160 You will also find innumerable other things in accordance with this in the Scriptures.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 7, par. 2.

{Rom 2:11; Acts 10:34-35; Jn 3:18}
(7) After all, this is the reason why he adds in this passage "For God shows no partiality."186 If this still seems doubtful to you, listen to what Peter declares in the Acts of the Apostles when he had entered the home of the Gentile Cornelius, "I truly understand that God shows no partiality, but in every place and among every nation anyone who does his will is acceptable to him."187 Now it is possible to oppose us with the saying of the Lord in the Gospel, "Everyone who believes in me is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God."188 [John 3:18] But let us see in what sense we who believe in Christ are not condemned, in order that we might know how he who has not believed is already condemned. For are we to think that anyone who believes in Christ and afterwards commits murder or adultery or speaks false testimony or does anything of this sort, which we sometimes see even believers perpetrating, that even then he who has believed in Christ will not be condemned for these things? It is certain that all these things will come to judgment. Therefore, the word of the Lord, "he who believes in me will not be condemned," has to be understood in the following sense: Anyone who has believed will not be condemned as an unbeliever and infidel; but he will undoubtedly be condemned for his own actions. So then, he who has not believed has already been condemned because he has not believed. Just as judgment still awaits a believer when he commits some sin in addition, though his faith is kept intact. So also the unbeliever shall not lose the remuneration for the good works he has done, his unbelief notwithstanding.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 7, par. 7.

{Rom 2:12-13; 1 Cor 9:21}
(1) All who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in God's sight, but the doers of the law who will be justified.195
(Rom. 2:12,13)
When the Apostle says that those who have sinned apart from the law are going to perish apart from the law, we need to ask whether this ought to be understood only of the law of Moses or also of the law of Christ or even of any human law under which any mortal happens to live, so that a person might be judged according to that law against which he sins. Or does he mean that anyone who is outside only the law of Moses will perish, as one who is outside of law, when he sins, even though he may live under some other law? For even the Apostle Paul himself, when he claims to be, as it were, without law for those who are without law, yet adds, "though I am not completely without law but am under Christ's law."196 By this he makes known that although he is not under the Law of Moses, he is nevertheless under law. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 8, par. 1.

{Rom 2:14-15}
(2) We have to consider whether it is not natural law,197 which dwells in all men generally, that makes it so that nearly all people commit sin against the law, as he says in what follows, "For when Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do naturally the things of the law, they, though not having the law, are a law to themselves. They show the work of the law is written on their hearts."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 8, par. 2.

{Rom 2:12}
(3) He says, "Shall all who have sinned under the law be judged by the law?" Undoubtedly he who is under the law of Christ will be judged by the law of Christ, and he who is under the law of Moses by the law of Moses. For he who is under Christ's law should not be considered to be one who is to be  judged by the law of Moses, even though he may appear to be subjected to Moses' law. He will not be judged for his failure to receive circumcision or for the fact that he does not observe the Sabbath. For even if he should be considered to be judged according to the Law of Moses, he will be judged according to the law that is spiritual.

{Lk 19:10; Mt 15:24; Ps 119:176; Lk 15:8-10; Lk 15:24; Ezek 34:1}
For perhaps on that account, in the Gospels the Lord makes known that he has a greater care for those who are perishing205 when he says,206 "The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."207 He also says, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."208 And David says, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant."209 Moreover in the Gospel the woman finds the mina which was lost after she cleaned the house.210 And the father rejoices more over the penitent younger son, who "was dead and is alive again, who was lost and has been found,"211 than over the son who had been neither lost nor found. In my opinion the younger son had just then fled from the natural law. This seems to be indicated when it says he squandered the part of his father's property which had fallen to him by extravagant living.212 And in the prophet Ezekiel it is charged against the shepherds that they have not gathered in the weak and have not searched for the perishing.213 And shortly thereafter the Lord himself says, "I myself will seek what has perished."214

{Rom 2:12; Lk 19:10; Mt 15:24; Jn 17:12; 1 Cor 1:19-20}
(5) One should observe however that in all these passages on no occasion is God said to have destroyed anyone. Rather each one experiences destruction of his own accord.215 For example in this passage it says, "They shall perish apart from law"; and, "The Son of Man came to seek what had perished,"216 not what he had destroyed; and, "to the sheep of the house of Israel that had perished,"217 not the sheep which he had destroyed. And when the Lord says, "I protected all those whom you have given me and not one of them has perished,"218 notice that he did not say, "I have not destroyed any of them." If, of course, God is anywhere said to destroy, you will discover that this is said with the meaning "to reject." For example when it says, "I shall destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent I shall reject."219

{Rom 2:13-16; Col 2:16; Ex 20:12-16; Acts 15:20; Acts 15:29; Tob 4:15; Mt 7:12; Lk 6:31; Deut 22:11; Ex 23:15; Lev 4:7}
It is certain that the Gentiles who do not have the law are not being said to do naturally the things of the law in respect to the Sabbath days, the new moon celebrations, or the sacrifices written about in the law.227 For it was not that law which is said to be written in the hearts of the Gentiles. The reference is instead to what they are able to perceive by nature,228 for instance, that they should not commit murder or adultery, they ought not steal, they should not speak falsely, they should honor father and mother, and the like.229 Possibly it is also written in the hearts of the Gentiles that God is one and the Creator of all things. And yet it seems to me that the things which are said to be written in their heart agree with the evangelical laws, where everything is ascribed to natural justice. For what could be nearer to the natural moral senses than that those things men do not want done to themselves, they should not do to others?230 Natural law is able to agree with the law of Moses according to the spirit but not according to the letter. For what natural insight shall there be in the command, for instance, that a person should circumcise his infant son on the eighth day;231 or that wool ought not be woven together with linen;232 or that one must not eat anything with yeast in it during the feast of unleavened bread?233 At different times I have presented such texts to the Jews234 and demanded of them that if there is something of benefit in such laws, let them make it known. We know that they usually give only this answer, "This is what has seemed good to the Lawgiver." But we who are aware that all these things must be understood spiritually believe therefore that it is "not the hearers but the doers of the law who will be justified,"235 but not the law according to the letter, since, because of its unattainableness, it cannot have any doer.236 Rather it is according to the spirit, through which means alone is it possible for the law to be fulfilled.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 9, par. 1.

{Rom 2:15}
(2) Now with respect to the words, "on their hearts," it is not to be thought that the law is said to be written on the bodily organ which is named the heart. For how could the flesh bring forth so much understanding of wisdom or contain such a great reservoir of memory? Rather one should realize that the soul's rational power is normally called the heart.238 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 9, par. 2.

{Jer 16:3; 1 Jn 3:21; 2 Cor 1:12; Num 20:4; Ezek 1:16; Lev 2:2; Gal 4:2; Wis 12:1-2}
(3) Certainly the Apostle says that those who have the law written down in their hearts make use of the testimony of the conscience. Consequently it appears necessary to discuss what the Apostle is referring to by "conscience," whether it is something substantially different from the heart or the soul. For it is said elsewhere of the conscience that it condemns and is not condemned, and it judges man but is itself not judged. As John says, "If our conscience239 does not condemn us, we have confidence before God."240 And again Paul himself says in another passage, "this is our boast, the testimony of our conscience."241 And so I perceive here such great freedom [of conscience] that indeed it is constantly rejoicing and exulting in good works but is never convicted of evil deeds. Instead it rebukes and convicts the soul to which it cleaves.242 In my opinion the conscience is identical with the spirit, which the Apostle says is with the soul as we have taught above.243 The conscience functions like a pedagogue to the soul,244 a guide and companion, as it were, so that it might admonish it concerning better things or correct and convict it of faults.245

{1 Cor 2:11; Rom 8:16; Dan 3:38 [LXX]; Mt 13:2; Lk 12:46; 1 Pet 1:23; Mt 24:40}
(4) It is of the conscience that the Apostle can say, "For no one among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man that is in him."246 And that is the spirit of the conscience, concerning which he says, "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit."247 Perhaps this is also the spirit who is united with the souls of the righteous which have shown themselves to be obedient in all matters, on account of which it is written, "Praise the Lord you spirits and souls of the just."248 But if a soul becomes disobedient to it and stubborn, it will be divided from it after death and will be separated.249 This is why, I think, it is said in the Gospel about the evil steward, "the master will divide him, and assign his part250 with the unbelievers."251 Perhaps it is the spirit about which it is written, "an incorruptible spirit is in all."252 In accordance with what we have said above, namely that the spirit is divided and separated from the sinful soul, with the result that it takes its place with the unbelievers, it is likewise possible to apply to this discussion that which is written, "There will be two in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. Two will be at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left."253
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 9, par. 4.

{Rom 2:15-16; Rom 2:5; Jer 16:10; 1 Kings 8:39}
(1) Now let us consider what follows, While their thoughts mutually accuse or even defend them on the day when God will judge the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ.254 [Rom 2:15] Who could doubt that this judgment-trial conducted by God is fair, when accusers, defenders, and witnesses are summoned?255 We men ought to take the example of this fair trial God carries out as a pattern. We should never think it possible for a fair trial to be held without someone to accuse, someone to defend, and witnesses. It must next be seen how the thoughts will either accuse the soul or defend it, on that day when God will judge the secrets of men. Surely he is not speaking here about thoughts which shall arise at that time but rather those which are now occurring within us.256 For when we think either good or evil things, certain marks and signs are left behind in our heart as if on wax tablets, both for the good thoughts and for the bad.257 These marks, which now lie hidden in the breast, are said to be revealed on that day by none other than him who alone is able to know the secrets of men.258 Our conscience shall also bear witness that the reasons for these signs and marks are not hidden from God.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 10, par. 1.

{Trinity; Jn 1:46; Rom 7:14; Rom 1:8; Rom 2:17-24}
(2) As we have observed in the writings of the prophets, not only has the person speaking been suddenly changed without notice, but also the person of those to whom or about whom the discourse is addressed.264 For instance, sometimes something is said under the persona of the Father, sometimes of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, and sometimes even something under the persona of the prophet or anyone else you like. And indeed, sometimes the message is directed to the nation of Israel, sometimes to foreign nations or to kings or to thousands of others. It seems to me that the Epistle to the Romans has been written in this way too. At various times the role of the one who is speaking is changed, so that sometimes the spiritual Paul is speaking, as is the case in a great number of passages in the letter.265 But at other times the fleshly Paul is speaking, as, for instance, when he says, "I am fleshly, having been sold under sin."266 This shall be made clear when we come to this passage, as the Lord directs. But occasionally a change also takes place of the persons to whom the discourse is being addressed, so that at one moment he is now speaking to the whole church of the Romans, "I thank God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world";267 but in other passages it is not to the whole church but all who judge others and yet themselves do the things which they condemn in others and are without excuse.268 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 11, par. 2.

{Rom 2:17-24}
(3) Here, however, the discourse is addressed neither to the church nor to the one who is passing judgment, where he says, "But if you call yourself a Jew and rest in the law," . . . So then, as in the prophetic writings, the person who wants to understand what is written must direct his attention carefully in order to ascertain the personae, i.e., who is speaking, to whom the words are addressed, or about whom the discourse is being made. So also, it seems to me, one must now do here in the Epistle to the Romans. [This discussion concerns Rom. 2:17-24]

{Rom 2:17-24; Rom 2:28-29; Rev 2:9; Rev 3:9; Gen 49:8-9; Jn 1:23; Jn 1:35; Jer 9:1}
(4) But now let us see what the Apostle says to him who is called a Jew. First of all it must be observed that he has not said of him, "But if you are a Jew," but rather, "if you call yourself a Jew." This is because to be a Jew and to be called a Jew are not the same thing. For Paul teaches in what follows that he is truly a Jew who has been circumcised "in secret" with the circumcision of the heart. . .. Moreover, John thus speaks in the Apocalypse about certain men "who claim to be Jews but are not."275 He even declares them to be "from the synagogue of Satan."276 Now one should know that he who is truly a Jew in secret derives his name from Judah, of whom it is written, "Judah, your brothers praise you; your hand is on the back of your enemies. Judah is a lion's whelp";277 and the other things prophesied there about our Lord and Savior.278

{Rev 2:9; Rev 3:9; Deut 2:9; Jer 12:10; Mt 15:14; Mt 6:23; Ps 45:13; Jer 13:17 [LXX]}
(5) let us see what the apostolic discourse has to say to this person who boasts that he is a Jew but is not.279 He says, "You who call yourself a Jew and place your repose entirely in the letter of the law and boast in God that you are his portion280 and that it has been granted to you to know God's will, and like an expert in the matter of testing things, you boast that you know and discern what is most beneficial and how to make these distinctions, so that you not only know what the good things are, indeed you discern as well what is better and more useful. You are confident too that you can be a guide for the blind. It is scarcely to be doubted that you belong to that lot of leaders, concerning whom the Lord was saying, 'They are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both fall into a pit.'281" So then, he is confident that he is a guide for the blind and also a light for those in darkness. Yet the Lord speaks no less to these, "If then the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"282 In spite of this they are confident that they are instructors of the foolish and teachers of children, as those who have received the form of knowledge and truth from the letter of the law. And because these things are professed but not truly possessed, the Apostle says to them, "You then that teach another do not teach yourself. And you who preach against stealing steal" the coming and presence of Christ, which has shone forth in the whole world. "You who forbid adultery commit adultery" in the synagogue of the people of God by introducing a depraved and adulterous word of doctrine to it; and you join that doctrine to the letter of the Law, which is outward, when you should instead read what has been written of the Law, "all the glory of the king's daughter is within."283 Ps 45.13 You should also note what is no less said of the law by the prophet, "Unless you listen in secret your soul shall weep."284    Jer 13.17 LXX.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 11, par. 5.

{Hos 2:20-21}
(6) You therefore who forbid adultery, you commit such a grave adultery that you introduce an adulterous understanding to it, of which you read that God said, "I will betroth you to myself in faith and mercy"!285

{Jn 2:19}
(7) "You that abhor idols are robbing temples" by violating the true temple of God, which is Christ Jesus; for you destroyed the temple of God which has been raised up again in three days in those who believe.286 Furthermore, he who steals from the law and the prophets the word that predicts Christ and conceals it, lest the people should hear and believe, is committing temple robbery and is truly violating the temple of God.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 11, par. 7.

{Jn 5:46; Rev 2:9; Rev 3:9; Col 2:21-22}
(8) This same person who calls himself a Jew and who boasts in the letter of the law of Moses is also convicted as a transgressor of the law when he does not believe in Christ. For if he believed Moses he would certainly believe in him of whom Moses wrote.287 It is on account of such people, then, those who are called Jews but are not,288 that the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles. This is not only because of their most evil deeds but also on account of the base and dispirited understanding they have of the law and the prophets. Moreover they become a laughingstock to the Gentiles themselves when they say, following the letter of the Law, "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 11, par. 8.

{Rom 2:17-24}
(9) In truth the Apostle is saying these things to the one who is a Jew in name but not in deed. Nevertheless it can also be applied to all people who possess merely the name of religion and piety but in whom works, knowledge, and faith are missing. For this reason we ought to discuss these things with greater concern for ourselves than for those who do not come to faith in Christ, lest anyone among us, who has become a true Jew through faith in Christ and the circumcision given in baptism,290 and who rests in the law of Christ, should boast too that he has come to know God by having turned away from the error of idols, and that he knows God's will.

(10) But if, even as it is occasionally accustomed to take place, someone turns financial gifts offered to God and the donations given to the poor into private gain, it is rightly said to him, "You, who abhor idols, rob temples."

{Rom 2:25-29}
(1). Circumcision indeed is of value if you keep the Law but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. So, if the uncircumcised keeps the righteous requirements297 of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision and will not that which is by nature uncircumcision, but who perfects the law, judge you who, through the letter and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law? For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something outward in the flesh. Rather, a person is a Jew who is one in secret, and with the circumcision of the heart in the spirit, not the letter, whose praise is not from men but from God.298 Rom. 2:25-29
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 1.

{Phil 3:2-3; 2 Cor 3:6; Ex 31:18; Deut 9:10; Lk 11:20; Mt 12:28; 2 Cor 3:3}
. . . For if, in fact, circumcision is of value in accordance with the word of the Apostle's word, saying, "circumcision is of value if you keep the law," the Apostle himself teaches in what follows299 that it is not the outward circumcision in the flesh but rather the circumcision of the heart, which is done by the Spirit and not through the letter, [M899] which receives praise, not from men but from God. And elsewhere he says, "Beware of the mutilation, for we are the circumcision, who serve God by the Spirit and who do not take confidence in the flesh."300 In my opinion this is the circumcision which the Apostle says is of value if you keep the law, not the law of the letter, whose circumcision you certainly do not receive in the flesh, but the law of the Spirit, according to which you must be circumcised in the heart. "For the letter kills but the Spirit gives life."301 For even God's law is not described as having been written with ink but by the finger of God,302 which refers to his Spirit.303 It was not written on tablets of stone but on the tablets of the heart.304 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 1.

{Rom 2:28-29; Ps 34:14}
(2) However someone could raise the objection that if the Apostle says that the circumcision of the heart is of value,305 which is, of course, understood to be none other than the cleansing of the soul and the casting aside of vices, why does he still add that a circumcision of this sort is of value if you keep the law, since it would seem that this circumcision does not happen except from the observation of the law? But consider whether perhaps the cutting off of vices and the cessation from evil works signifies "circumcision;" but to do good and to make what is perfect is to "keep the law." For perfection does not exist in the one who merely ceases from evil, but in him who does good. This is what we are plainly instructed in the Psalm when it says, "Turn away from evil." Yet it does not stop there, but goes on to say, "and do good."306 In a similar manner then the Apostle, since he was steeped in these things, says exactly that circumcision and the casting aside of evil things is of value if you keep the law of good things. For one cannot be perfect if he merely does nothing evil, but only if he does something good. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 2.

{Rom 2:25; Jas 2:26}
(4) He says, "but if you are a transgressor of the law," i.e., by failing to do good, as we have explained above, "your circumcision has become uncircumcision." That is to say, even your apparent abstention from evil is reckoned to you as unbelief, since you do not do works of faith and righteousness. . . . Moreover, if anyone in the Church who is circumcised by means of the grace of baptism should afterwards become a transgressor of Christ's law, his baptismal circumcision shall be reckoned to him as the uncircumcision of unbelief.309 For it says, "Faith without works is dead";310 and the lot of the wicked steward is with the unbelievers.311 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 4.

{Rom 2:25}
(5) But this must also be observed, that when he says, "Circumcision indeed is of value if you keep the law," he has not added, "but if you do not keep the law," as the sequence would have seemed. Rather he says, "but if you are a transgressor of the law." By this he shows that not to keep the law is different from "transgressing the law." For not even Paul himself always keeps the law, and yet on no occasion is he a transgressor of the Law. . . . He keeps the Law, then, who observes it according to the letter; and he transgresses it, who does not keep its spiritual sense.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 5.

{Law, Mosaic; Mt 5:17; Rom 2:26-27}
(6) But the "righteous requirements"322 of the law are a matter of its moral aspect. For "law" is a general term; righteous requirements are but a part of the law.323 For the law contains righteous requirements, judgments, commands, formalities,324 and many other categories like this. If he is not saying that the uncircumcised keeps not law itself, but the righteous requirements of the law, then he is put so far ahead of the circumcised one who transgresses the law that he may even judge [the law]. And he has added well, "who perfects the law." For he who lives according to the letter is said to keep the Law but he who lives according to the spirit perfects it. The perfection of the law takes place in Christ, who said, "I have not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it."325 Now to fulfill the law means to perfect the law.326 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 6.

{Rom 8:3; Rom 8:8; Rom 8:13; Rom 2:25-29}
(7) Therefore the fleshly Jew keeps the Law, but the spiritual man and the Jew in secret perfects it. Where the one becomes a transgressor of the Law, in contrast the other here becomes a judge of the transgressor. The fleshly Jew becomes a transgressor because the law itself is weak through the flesh. For if it were not weak according to the flesh it would certainly not have been said, "For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh."327 You shall never find it written, however, that the law was weak through the spirit. Consequently, "those who are in the flesh cannot please God,"328 but those who through the spirit put to death the deeds of the flesh329 will not only live but will even be judges, not only of men but even of angels.330 For the praise of the one is from men, but the praise of the other is from God.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 12, par. 7.

{Rom 2:26-27}
But if the uncircumcision keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not that which is by nature uncircumcision, but who perfects the law, judge you who, through the letter and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law?312 We have said above that the Apostle discusses two kinds of Jews and two kinds of circumcision.313 Sometimes he mentions the fleshly, sometimes the spiritual, circumcision. In the present passage it seems that he is calling the Gentiles who have come to faith in Christ uncircumcised in their flesh, "the uncircumcision." He compares and contrasts them, as they observe the spiritual law, with the Jews who, through the letter and the circumcision of the flesh, are transgressors of the law and whom he says are going to be judged by those in whom there is no circumcision of the flesh but the observation of the Law.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 1.

{Rom 2:26-27}
(2) By comparison, however, we can admonish our own people in the Church as well. For instance we might say that the catechumens are the ones who are still uncircumcised, or even Gentiles, and those who are believers by means of the grace of baptism are the circumcised. If a catechumen, then, who has not yet been circumcised by means of the grace of the [baptismal] bath, should observe the law of Christ and keep his commands and righteous requirements, by comparison, is he not judging him who is called a believer but who does not keep the precepts and law of Christ and who despises the commandments?
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 2.

{Rom 2:26-27; Gal 5:2; 1 Cor 9:20-22; Mt 12:42; Jn 1:7; Acts 10:11; Acts 21:26}
(3) But consider whether it is possible that Paul is understood in this passage to concede that it is said that even after the coming of Christ, fleshly circumcision, which was observed from the law, is of some value for those who keep the law?315 This accords with the fact that at the beginning phase of our faith it was still being observed by believers, as in the Acts of the Apostles it is taught that Peter kept the law respecting the discrimination of foods,316 as did Paul respecting the sacrifices of purification.317 Perhaps here also the Apostle seems to have set forth a circumcision of this kind, which he says is of value in this way, if the Law should also be kept. But if the Law is not kept, this circumcision will be turned into uncircumcision, that is to say, it will be of no value whatsoever. On the contrary, he who seems to profess the observance of the Law through his circumcision of the flesh has a more severe judgment, and by transgressing the Law he is judged by him who has not in fact received the circumcision of the flesh, but nevertheless has kept the righteous requirements of the Law. Whether this sense ought also be received here, you as the reader must consider since the Apostle himself professes to become a Jew to the Jews, and to become as one without Law to those who are without Law, and to be all things to all men that he might gain them all.318 Perhaps it is on that principle that he seems to have here granted to the Jews things which he does not grant to Gentile believers when writing Galatians. For he says, "If you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you."319
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 3.

{Gal 5:2; Rom 2:25}
(4) Circumcision is of no value, then, for those who think that some justification is to be obtained from it, but it is of value for those who imagined that certain people were not going to come to Christ if circumcising their sons would be denied them. For at the beginning there were some who were clinging to circumcision with an excessive devotion as an indigenous mark of their own nation. They seemed to be hindered from the faith if that which they could not be without were denied them. Therefore, it seems that the Apostle is saying to men of this sort, so as not to close the door of faith to them, "Circumcision is of value if you keep the Law but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision."320 But, on the other hand, if believing Gentiles were to be compelled to receive circumcision, an injury would seem to be done to faith in Christ and to the proclamation of the word. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 4.

{Rom 2:25}
(5) But this must also be observed, that when he says, "Circumcision indeed is of value if you keep the Law," he has not added, "but if you do not keep the law," as the sequence would have seemed. Rather he says, "but if you are a transgressor of the law." By this he shows that not to keep the Law is different from transgressing the Law. For not even Paul himself always keeps the law, and yet on no occasion is he a transgressor of the law. Furthermore, in what follows he says, "If the uncircumcised keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not that which is by nature uncircumcision but who perfects the law condemn you who, through the letter and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law?"321 He keeps the law, then, who observes it according to the letter; and he transgresses it, who does not keep its spiritual sense. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 5.

{Rom 2:25-26; Mt 5:17}
(6) But the "righteous requirements"322 of the Law are a matter of its moral aspect. For "the Law" is a general term; righteous requirements are but a part of the law.323 For the Law contains righteous requirements, judgments, commands, formalities,324 and many other categories like this. If he is not saying that the uncircumcised keeps not law itself, but the righteous requirements of the law, then he is put so far ahead of the circumcised one who transgresses the law that he may even judge [the transgressor]. And he has added well, "who perfects the law." For he who lives according to the letter is said to keep the Law but he who lives according to the spirit perfects it. The perfection of the Law takes place in Christ, who said, "I have not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it."325 Now to fulfill the law means to perfect the law.326 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 6.

{Rom 2:25-26; Rom 8:3; Rom 8:8; Rom 8:13}
 (7) Therefore the fleshly Jew keeps the Law, but the spiritual man and the Jew in secret perfects it. Where the one becomes a transgressor of the law, in contrast the other here becomes a judge of the transgressor. The fleshly Jew becomes a transgressor because the law itself is weak through the flesh. For if it were not weak according to the flesh it would certainly not have been said, "For what was impossible for the law, in that it was weak through the flesh."327 You shall never find it written, however, that the law was weak through the spirit. Consequently, "those who are in the flesh cannot please God,"328 but those who through the spirit put to death the deeds of the flesh329 will not only live but will even be judges, not only of men but even of angels.330 For the praise of the one is from men, but the praise of the other is from God. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 7.

{Gen 17:9-12}
(8) Let us go back then and make known what is contained in the Law and in the other Scriptures about circumcision. We find the first written command to circumcise in Genesis, when to Abraham were given responses in this fashion, "God said to Abraham, 'You shall keep my covenant, you and all your descendants after you throughout their generations. And this is the covenant which I have arranged between me and you and between me and between your descendants after you throughout their generations: every male among you shall be circumcised. And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. And the boy among you shall be circumcised on the eighth day"332  . . . We should not conceal, however, that in other copies the words "on the eighth day" are not found, at least not in this passage.333 Gen. 17:14 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 8.

{Gen 17:9-12; Gen 17:12-13}
(11) Going back then to the testimonies which we have brought forth from the law, let us discuss more attentively whether this kind of command seems to loom over the Jewish nation alone or whether it binds believing Gentiles to the same fate. Therefore, let us consider the oracle which came to Abraham. Whom did he command to keep the covenants of circumcision? It says, "You and all your descendants after you throughout their generations, between me and them that every male among them shall be circumcised. They shall circumcise the flesh of their foreskin, so that it might be a sign of the covenant between me and them. Every male shall be circumcised on the eighth day."338 Indeed, he openly declares that he wants even those born of foreign parents to be circumcised, that is to say, those who by no means are regarded as Abraham's stock. For he says, "Both the indigenous slave and the one bought with money from all the sons of those born in a foreign land who is not of your descendants must be circumcised with circumcision."339 On no occasion has he mentioned the proselyte, i.e., the foreigner, but he certainly orders the indigenous slave to be circumcised, whether born at home in that nation or even the one bought at a price. He does not bind the freedman, the guest, or the foreigner to be circumcised. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 11.

{Lev 12:2-3; Lev 17:2; Num 18:26}
(12) Let us now examine even the law found in Leviticus in order to ascertain in what sense God is instructing Moses concerning this command. He says, "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them: If a woman conceives and bears a male offspring."340 After a few things it says, "On the eighth day she shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin."341 Notice here as well how Moses is commanded to speak only to the sons of Israel concerning the law of circumcision; there is no mention of those born in a foreign land. For if we believe that what is entered in the law has been written through the divine Spirit, then assuredly nothing can be considered either to have been added or kept silent to no purpose. For this reason it is absolutely critical to observe the distinctions. Sometimes in certain commands it is said, "Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them."342 But in certain others it is added that not merely the sons of Israel but also the proselytes, that is to say, the foreigners, [M904] are being addressed. In light of the fact that in some passages it is said, "Speak to Aaron!"343 and elsewhere, "to Aaron's sons";344 and elsewhere, "Speak to the Levites and say to them";345 certainly the rest of the sons of Israel are not subject to these laws which have been promulgated for the sons of Aaron, or for the Levites or for Aaron himself. Likewise, in the things commanded to the sons of Israel, where no mention is made of the one born in a foreign land, it must not be considered to have universal validity or to become a universal law when a qualification of the addressee is given. But to demonstrate this let us quote a few testimonies out of many, by which we may establish that the addition or qualification in names like this is essential. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 12.

{Lev 10:8-9; Lev 9:1-3; Lev 11:1-2; Lev 17:10-12}
13. And again to Aaron he says, "Drink no wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you enter the tabernacle of testimony."350 Yet there are other things commanded neither to Aaron nor to the sons of Israel, but instead to the elders of Israel he says in this manner, "Speak to the elders of Israel, saying: Take a male goat from the goats for a sin offering,"351 and so forth. Can there be any question that this law is directed only to the elders of the sons of Israel? Moreover the law, no less special, concerning clean and unclean animals appears also to be given to the sons of Israel; for it is written in this way, "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: Speak to the sons of Israel, saying to them: These are the animals that you may eat,"352 and so on. In this manner then we should also understand the things said about circumcision, whether in what has been said to Abraham or in what is contained in Leviticus: no one is bound to the law of circumcision unless he derives his lineage from Abraham or is their indigenous slave or a purchased slave. Now would you like to see that God, whenever he wants, could have expressly made known that those born in a foreign land are bound by one and the same law? Listen then to what is written, "And the Lord said to Moses: 'Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the sons of Israel and say to them: If anyone of the sons of Israel or of the foreigners who reside among them eats any blood, I will set my soul against that soul that eats blood, and I will cut it off from his own people. For the soul of all flesh is its blood. And I have given it to you for making atonement for your souls on the altar; for the blood makes atonement for the soul. Therefore I have said to the sons of Israel: No soul among you shall eat blood, nor shall any foreigner who resides among you eat blood."353 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 13.

{Num 16:9; Deut 28:43-44; Acts 15:20; Acts 15:29; Lev 17:13-14}
(14) You see then that the law respecting blood, which was given universally, both to the sons of Israel and to foreigners,354 is observed by us Gentiles as well who, through Jesus Christ, believe in God. . . . This is why the Church of even the Gentiles has received the universal law which safeguards against blood with the sons of Israel. For in those days the blessed council of the apostles, understanding that these things were written in the law in this way, for that reason pronounced dogmas and decrees for the Gentiles, writing that they should not only keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols and from fornication but also from blood and strangled things.356 But you will perhaps ask whether, just as the observance concerning blood makes clear, so it could be taught concerning things strangled that a universal law has been given both to the sons of Israel and to foreigners, since the statutes of the apostles decreed that the Gentiles are to observe even this. Listen to how carefully it has been safeguarded in the laws of God concerning this as well, "And anyone of the sons of Israel, or of the foreigners who reside among you, whoever hunts down a beast or bird that may be eaten shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth. For the soul of all flesh is its blood."357 Behold, then, how the Lawgiver takes care to join the foreigners to the sons of Israel, through what he wants to be a universal command, but to distinguish whom he wants to observe these matters, through the special precepts he gives. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 13, par. 14.

{Lev 17:8-9; Lev 17:12-14; Mt 8:4; Lk 17:15-18; Num 7:4; Num 10:2}
(15) However among the things we have quoted above from Leviticus, there is mentioned this writing as well, "Anyone of the sons of Israel or of the foreigners who are among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice, and does not bring it to the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony to offer it to the Lord, that man shall be cut off from the people."358 It appears here that the sacrifices have been imposed upon the foreigner as well and therefore Gentiles in the Church are accountable to make burnt offerings. But even the words and syllables of the law, so I would say, must be examined very carefully. For it says, if anyone offers a burnt offering or sacrifice he should bring it to the entrance of the tabernacle of testimony. The law does not [M906] command him to offer it; it merely teaches how one should offer it if, by chance, he does so. For it is certain and cannot be doubted that, while the temple of Jerusalem was standing and the religion entrusted to the fathers was flourishing, many, even from the Gentiles, were coming to the temple to worship and to offer sacrifices. But this could properly happen only as long as the condition of that place remained unimpaired. The reason for this was that it had been commanded to happen in only one place, concerning which he commands here that the victim to be slaughtered should be brought to the entrance of the tabernacle. After all, even the Savior said to those ten lepers whom he had cleansed, "Go and show yourselves to the priest and make the offerings for yourselves as Moses commanded."359 When one of them had returned to give thanks to the Savior, the Lord said, "Were not ten made clean? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give thanks to God except this foreigner?"360 So then, while the condition of the temple remained intact it was customary for foreigners to offer sacrifices. But now, can that which is impossible for Israel's own worshipers to offer be demanded from foreigners?361

(16) But we have said all these things in order to show what great distinctions exist in the law between the commandments, and to teach in particular about the precept of circumcision, which was imposed upon no one else except those who stem from Abraham's race, their home-born slaves, and those slaves purchased at a price. But free from such laws are those from the Gentiles who, through Christ, believe in God.

{Ex 12:48-49}
(17) And yet, they could still heave a deadly javelin at us by protesting that proselytes too were made accountable to circumcision in the law, based on what was written in Exodus in this manner, "But if a proselyte should come to you and should celebrate the Passover to the Lord, you shall circumcise all his males and then he shall draw near to celebrate it and he shall be regarded as a native of the land. No uncircumcised person shall eat of it. There shall be one law for the native and for the foreigner who comes to you."363 Although the objection may appear to have penetrated, nevertheless the admirable caution of the Lawgiver comes to our aid on all occasions. For consider what he has not said in this passage, namely that the foreigner who comes to you must celebrate the Passover to the Lord and must be circumcised. Rather he is discriminating with extremely careful reserve when he says, "If he should come to you and if he should celebrate the Passover."364 For it is impossible to doubt in this connection that if someone celebrates the Jewish Passover with the Jews, he ought also to be circumcised.

Free from it and foreign to it are the proselyte people who come to him, who ascends and has come higher and higher.369 But that one is descending and has gone lower and lower; and through the mercy of Christ the former people has become the head and the latter the tail.370 For the last have become first and the first last.371

(23) [Concerning Ezek 44:9]: Let us see whether they could perhaps [figuratively] refer to the two general sins, in respect to which to be uncircumcised is not advantageous, that is to say, in respect to faith and works. This would mean that the one who does not have faith would be uncircumcised in the heart and the one who does not have works would be uncircumcised in the flesh. For one without the other is condemned, seeing that faith without works is called "dead";384 and that no one is justified before God by works without faith.385 Thus I am convinced that the prophetic word shall be properly applied to that people which is made up of believers, to whom it is being said, "No foreigner who is among you in the midst of the house of Israel, who is uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter my sanctuary."386 Doubtless this is what the Lord also says in the Gospel, "He who believes in me keeps my commands";387 and again, "he who hears these words of mine and does them";388 and likewise, "Why do you say to me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?"389 You see, then, that everywhere faith is joined with works and works are united with faith. Accordingly, circumcision of the heart means to hold no base and unworthy opinions concerning the faith; circumcision of the flesh means to commit nothing unclean and defiled in our works and actions. For whoever becomes uncircumcised and unclean in one of these areas is prohibited by the utterances of God from entering into the sanctuary.

On the other hand, if someone makes use of his lawful obligations in an affair of this sort, as much as suffices for the production of offspring, would he not be considered to be circumcised?

{Josh 5:2-4; Gen 3:6}
(26) Indeed since we are treating the reasoning behind circumcision, it will not seem absurd to add to the discussion the fact that Joshua401 [LXX Jesus] the son of Nun is reported to have circumcised the sons of Israel for the second time with stone knives by the command of the Lord,402 which, when looked at literally, seems factually utterly impossible. For in those who have been circumcised once in the flesh of their foreskin, what could be found to remove in a second circumcision? But it is plain that our Jesus, who, after Moses, truly leads the sons of the Israel into the holy land flowing with milk and honey,403 the promised land,404 circumcises the people comprised of believers405 not once but twice.406 For his first circumcision is where he cuts away from them the worship of idols and the fabrications of philosophical persuasion. But he carries out the second circumcision when he cuts off the habits and passions of the old man and the vices of the flesh. Then is fulfilled what is written in Joshua son of Nun, "Today I have taken away from you the reproaches of Egypt."407 For a person carries around the reproaches of Egypt within himself who, though he is in the Church serving as a soldier under our general, Jesus, is nevertheless enslaved to Egyptian customs and barbaric mental inclinations.

{Circumcision}
(28) [In the following sentence, Origen defends the Old Testament Law against the pagans who ridicule its commandment about circumcision]: Through your own histories you will find that not only the priests and religious teachers of the Egyptians practiced circumcision but also the Arabs, Ethiopians, Phoenicians, and others, whose endeavors respecting superstitions of this kind were esteemed all the more honorable because of it.413

{1 Pet 1:18-19; 1 Cor 7:23; Mt 16:8; Ex 6:9; Lk 2:21}
(29) Without a doubt you confess it to be true what is written in Peter's epistle, "We have been redeemed not at a corruptible price of silver and gold but with the precious blood of the only begotten."414 If then we have been bought at a price, as Paul also confirms,415 undoubtedly we were bought from someone whose slaves we were, who also demanded the price he wanted so that he might release from his authority those whom he was holding.416 Now it was the devil who was holding us, to whom we had been dragged off by our sins.417 Therefore he demanded the blood of Christ as the price for us. So then, until the blood of Jesus was given, which was so precious that it alone would suffice for the redemption of all, it was necessary for those who were being trained up in the law to offer their own blood for themselves [in the act of circumcision] as a kind of foreshadowing of the future redemption. And therefore for us as those for whom the price of Christ's blood has been furnished, we do not have need to offer a price for ourselves anymore, that is to say, to offer the blood of circumcision. But if it seems criminal to you [here Origen is addressing the Gnostics] that the God of the Law should command that wounds be inflicted upon infants and that their blood be shed, you will find fault with what has been done to Christ as well. For he was circumcised on the eighth day,418 and he also received wounds during his passion and poured out his own blood with his punishment on the cross.

(34) But now that this digression [about circumcision] is finished, which was perhaps justifiably somewhat long, let us return to the conclusion of this section of the Apostle's letter. Often it is discussed by the Apostle where he points out through specific examples that men are of dual aspects; the one he usually calls the outer man and the other, the inner man.426 He says that the one is according to the flesh and the other is according to the spirit. In my opinion this is established from what is written in Genesis, where it says that the one was made in the image of God and the other was formed from the clay of the earth.427 And here he calls the one an outward Jew and the other a Jew in secret.428

{Mt 5:28; Rom 2:28-29; Rom 8:13}
(35) One should know that both the inner and outer man act differently in some circumstances, but act in common in others. For there are certain things which begin in the inner man and extend to the outer man. Yet other things begun by the outer man extend to the inner. What I am saying is as follows. Suppose chastity should begin with the inner man. It will undoubtedly extend to the outer, for it is impossible for someone who does not previously commit adultery in his heart to be able to commit adultery with his body.429 But if chastity begins in the outer man, it does not immediately pass as well into inner self control, as if the one who avoids committing adultery in the body will be free from adultery in his heart. In this way then circumcision of the inner and outer man should be understood according to the laws of figurative interpretation since the inner man no longer lusts in his heart, nor does the outer man serve lustful desire in the body. So he is called circumcised in the flesh whom the Apostle says is no longer in the flesh but in the spirit,430 and who puts to death the deeds of the flesh by means of the spirit.431

{Rom 2:28-29; Num 24:9}
(36) He who has understood this shall find the figures of vast mysteries foretold in the reasoning behind circumcision. He will also discover that he who is a Jew in secret and who has been circumcised in the inner man excels and surpasses the one who is a Jew according to the flesh to the same degree that the Judah [i.e. Jesus] who is praised by his own brothers and who slept like a lion and arose like the whelp of a lion,435 excels and surpasses the Judah who was born from the loins of Jacob according to the flesh.

(1). "Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much, in every way. For in the first place they were entrusted with the oracles of God. What if some of them did not believe? Has their unbelief nullified the faithfullness of God? By no means! Let God be true but every man a liar; as it is written, "So that you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged."436 In this letter Paul, like an arbiter sitting between the Jews and the Greeks, i.e., believing Gentiles,437 summons and invites both groups to faith in Christ in such a way as to not offend the Jews completely by destroying the Jewish ceremonies nor to cause despair in the Gentiles by affirming the observance of the Law and of the letter. And whether he is recalling the promises or the punishments, he apportions the word to each people. For instance when he says, "for those who are contentious and who distrust the truth but believe in wickedness, there will be wrath, fury, and anguish for the entire life of a man who does evil, for the Jew first and for the Greek."438

(4) Yes, in fact because he knew that many promises in the Law and the Prophets evidently came to the Jews, in order that the Gentiles might not despair as those having nothing in common with the recorded promises, he teaches them that they themselves may become Jews and possess circumcision according to the mystical meaning. That is why he says, "For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something outward in the flesh. Rather, a person is a Jew who is one in secret, with the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit and not the letter, whose praise is not from men but from God."448 Yet because in all these things he had made the cause of the Gentiles superior in a measure, as if he is replying to the complaints of those who are of the circumcision group, he sets forth these things contained in the present section, by saying, "Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much, in every way."

{Rom 3:1}
(5) Lest he seem to be a less than fair arbiter449 sitting between these two peoples, he tells us what advantage the Jew and circumcision in the flesh possess and he says they have great advantages in every way. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 5.

{Rom 3:1-2}
(6.) He now adds what great advantages there are. "First," he says, "they were entrusted with the oracles of God." For though now the oracles of God are entrusted even to the Gentiles, at first, he says, they were entrusted to the Jews. But my question is: What does it mean when it is said that the oracles of God were first entrusted to the Jews? Is he saying this concerning both the writings and the books, or concerning the meaning and understanding of the Law? For we see many Jews from infancy until old age ever learning but never attaining the knowledge of the truth.450 And how shall what is said appear to be true, that they possess some advantage in that to them were first entrusted the oracles of God, in which they understood, "neither what they say nor what they assert"?451 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 6.

{Acts 9:15; Rom 3:2}
7. Furthermore, Christ's apostles themselves and Paul, the chosen vessel,456 because he came from the Jews and from the circumcision, he too possessed a great advantage in every way over the Gentiles whom he was teaching. For the oracles of God had been entrusted to him. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 7.

{Rom 3:2; 2 Cor 3:6; Jn 5:46}
8. One should take note of that which he says, "they were entrusted with the oracles of God," that he has not said that their writings were entrusted to them, but the oracles of God. From this, a way is given to us to understand that to those who read and do not understand, and who read and do not believe, the letter alone is entrusted, concerning which the Apostle says, "The letter kills."457 But the oracles of God are entrusted to those who, by understanding and believing the things Moses has written, believe also in Christ, as the Lord also says, "If you had believed Moses, you would certainly also believe me, for he wrote about me."458 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 8.

{Mt 8:10; Mt 8:11-12; Lk 13:29}
9. But granted that the Jew should have an advantage in their writings, that he should even have some advantage in the oracles of God, does this mean that Gentiles who come to Christ are completely abandoned? Or is there also some respect in which they also might have an advantage? Listen to the Lord as he speaks to the centurion who was a Gentile believer, "Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith."459 Notice therefore what a great advantage the Gentiles possess when it comes to faith. The Lord speaks of them in another passage as well, "they will come from the east and the west and from the four winds of the earth and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God; but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness."460 So then, when it comes to the laws and writings, the Jews possess a great advantage in every way; but when it comes to faith, I would say that, comparatively, the Gentiles have a great advantage in every way.

{Rom 3:2; 2 Cor 3:6; Am 6:1[LXX]}
10. In the investigation of this subject we must of course ask whether the oracles of God may be said to have been entrusted first to the Samaritans as well. For it appears that among them as well the Law of Moses is preserved. Yet I would say that not even the letter, which is said to kill,461 has been entrusted to them. For the prophet says of them, "Woe to those who spurn Mount Zion and trust in the mountain of Samaria."462 By repudiating the Prophets, they estrange themselves from the writings of God.463 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 10.

{Ex 31:18; Ex 32:19}
 (12) Suppose the Jews are unwilling to accept the opinion of our Apostle which says that the letter of the Law kills. Perhaps they think injury is done to the Law if it would seem to be spurned according to the letter. Let us then turn back to Moses himself and see how highly he esteemed the letter of the Law. When he had received the stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God,467 he conferred so little honor upon the letter of the Law that he threw down the tablets from his own hands and shattered to pieces what had in fact been written by the finger of God.468 Yet he was not branded as being guilty of impiety because of this act. You see, then, that it is not Paul alone who spurns the letter of the Law.

15. Yet the unbelief of these persons does not make void the faithfullness [pistin] of God. I understand "faith [pistin] of God" to mean either that faith by which God has faith in those to whom he entrusts his oracles or that faith by which those who receive the divine oracles from him believe in God. Let us therefore remember that the unbelief of those who do not come to faith or who fall away from it-if, perchance, anyone should ridicule us for doing works of faith, either when we fast, or when we practice mercy, or when we devote ourselves to studies and to the Law of God, or even when we endure tortures and martyrdom for Christ's sake-we should always remember that their unbelief does not make void the faith of God which is in us.

{Rom 3:4}
16. What follows after this appears to have been added somewhat out of sequence. For he says, "But let God be true but every man a liar, as it is written, 'So that you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.'" Nevertheless by bending these words, so to speak, we shall attempt to fit them into their context.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 16.

{Rom 3:3-4}
17. It may be, he says, that certain Jews have not believed; yet concerning their unbelief it must be said that God alone is true while every man is a liar. For even if there is someone who is just, it is nevertheless unavoidable that he would deviate from the truth in something, inasmuch as it is nearly impossible for human nature to stay true in everything.

{Rom 3:4; Mt 6:10; Cant 1:3; Ps 122:7}
18. But now let us see what the following words mean, "Let God be true but every man a liar." . . . In the first place, then, it ought to be recognized that it does not say "Let God be true" in the imperative mood. For it is ridiculous to think that God can be commanded to be true. Rather, just as we say, "Let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven";483 or, again, as we say, "Let there be peace by your power,"484 not commanding but wishing, or rather proclaiming and being certain that it is impossible for peace to take place except by the power of God. So also here, it should be interpreted as a phrase of proclamation, "Let God be true," as a way of saying, God is true, "but every man is a liar." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 18.

{Ps 116:11}
19. It should also be realized that the phrase "every man is a liar" is taken from the 115th Psalm where it says, "I said in my alarm, every man is a liar."485

{Jn 10:35}
21. But if we turn back to the inner meaning of Scripture we shall find that all prophets and apostles are among those to whom the word of God comes, as it is written, "and the word of the Lord came to this or that prophet." But the Lord declares in the Gospel that those to whom the word of God comes are not men but "gods." For he says the following, "If he calls them 'gods' to whom the word of God came-and the Scripture cannot be annulled."495 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 21.

{Rom 3:4; Ps 51:4}
(22) What follows has clearly been taken from the Fiftieth Psalm, "so that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged."496 The complete sense in this Psalm is put in this fashion, "Against you alone have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your words and prevail when you are judged."497 . . .  Moreover what follows tends to this understanding, "So that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged." For God is judged in the disputations of the wise, when some think one way about God, but others think differently in various details. Therefore he prevails over those who make judgments about him when he himself reveals his own verdict to all who are in error, both how and in what manner he ought to be believed in and worshiped.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 2, ch. 14, par. 22.

{Paul}
2. Through nearly the entire text of this epistle composed by the Apostle Paul, it will perhaps seem that the sequence of thought2 is quite incoherent. One moment his words are directed against the Gentiles, the next instant they judge in their favor and against the Jews, then at another moment something about the Jews or even in favor of the Jews is asserted. And some of them he considers worthy of praise, others he disparages.3 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 2.

{2 Cor 3:6; Rom 11:23-26}
3. The result is that he seems to slip from one digression into another. But we who believe him who says, "He has made us competent to be ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit,"5 find that his meaning is far loftier than the method of human craft is credited to possess.6 For through the entire text of this epistle he wants to show either how salvation came to those who lived according to the Law before the coming of Christ or how, on the basis of Israel's unbelief, salvation would be bestowed upon the Gentiles through the coming of the Savior.7 Furthermore he wants to show that not all Gentiles entirely come to salvation but only those who have believed; nor is the entire nation of Israel rejected but a remnant of believers are being saved.8 This is why, as I have said, the sequence of thought seems confused, as he pursues the different interests of the believers and unbelievers of both sides. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 3.

{Rom 3:4}
(3 cont.) In such matters he is inevitably forced to turn his words even to God in order to teach that the judgments of God in all these various cases of reception and rejection are true and just9 but that, among men, much lying abounds. That is why he says, "May God be true but every man a liar, as it is written, "in order that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged."10 We have spoken above about these matters above as well as we could.11 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 3.

{Rom 3:4-6}
(4) Therefore, seeing now that it would be possible to make the very pertinent objection to him that if, in order for God to be true, every man must necessarily be a liar, and if the righteousness of God is confirmed through the unrighteousness of men, God, who brings wrath upon men, will appear unjust. For it would seem to be through human unrighteousness that his own righteousness is proven. For if our, that is human, unrighteousness confirms the righteousness of God, then humanity will not seem to really deserve punishment, since it is through human beings that God's righteousness is regarded as clearer and more commendable. By no means, he says, may we interpret it so that God seems unjust when he brings wrath against men. For how will he who judges the world be considered unjust, since the term itself, "judgment," shows that he does nothing without judgment? It is established that where there is judgment there is justice. For both "judge" and "judgment" are named from "justice."12 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 4.

Footnote:  In this section and in what follows, indeed in the whole Commentary, it needs to be remembered that iustitia/iniustitia can be translated as justice/injustice or righteousness/unrighteousness, just as iustus/iniustus can mean just/unjust or righteous/unrighteous. Both senses should be kept in mind where these words and their verbal forms occur. 

{Rom 3:4-5}
 6. "God is unjust who inflicts wrath. I am speaking according to man. By no means!" That which is said, "God is unjust who inflicts wrath," because of the 
fact that "our unrighteousness confirms the righteousness of God," is being said not according to God nor according to God's wisdom but according to man and according to what is said, "Every man is a liar."15 We have said these things treating only as far as the sequence of his discourse and the coherence of the statements, so that the very separating of the words might give us a broader path for understanding. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 6.

{Rom 3:5-8}
7. Every discipline rests upon things which are proper to it and things which are adverse, that is to say, opposites.16 For instance, medical science professes the knowledge not only of health, but also of illness. Though it strives after health, nevertheless it cannot ignore what relates to illness. Likewise wisdom is based upon the knowledge of good and evil;17 moderation consists in knowing what things ought to be chosen and what ought to be shunned; and fortitude is not ignorant of those things which pertain to fear. So also in righteousness, it is necessary for it to know the aspects of unrighteousness. Therefore, if we want to know what righteousness is, it is essential for us to know what unrighteousness is; and when we have arrived at a complete knowledge of unrighteousness, on that basis we shall recognize what righteousness is as well; for when it becomes clear what is unjust, as a consequence, what is just will become visible as well. And because righteousness is in God, whose nature is inaccessible to human perception, but unrighteousness dwells in us men, in fact in all rational creatures, from our unrighteousness, which is known to us, the righteousness of God, which is, as it were, inaccessible and incomprehensible to us, is recognized and confirmed and produced as if from the opposition of opposites.18 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 7.

{Rom 3:5-8}
8. Therefore the Apostle Paul reproaches the ignorance of those who raise the unreasonable objection, supposing that God, who brings wrath upon men, is unjust since his righteousness is confirmed by our unrighteousness. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 8.

{Rom 3:5}
9. He says, "if our unrighteousness confirms the righteousness of God," in order to show that God is not against men but righteousness is against unrighteousness. But wrath is brought against men because they have given room to unrighteousness in themselves. Consequently God, who is righteousness, shall not seem unjust when he vents his anger against unrighteousness. For it would not befit him to be favorable toward it. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 9.

{Rom 3:5-6}
12.  These things have been stated as they occurred to us as an explanation of that which is written, "Is God unjust who brings wrath" either "against men?" as we have said is read in some of the copies, or, as we have it, "I am speaking according to man. By no means!"33 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 12.

{Rom 3:6; 1 Jn 5:19}
13. Moreover he says next, "For then how does God judge the world?" In this passage "world" refers to the men who are in this world, just as elsewhere we read that "the whole world lies under the evil one."34 He is certainly showing that all men who dwell in this world are under evil. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 13.

{Rom 3:7}
14. Next let us now see the meaning of the statement, "For if the truth of God abounded in my falsehood to his glory." In this world there are many kinds of religions and a multitude of philosophical sects. . . . By the coming of the truth of God and his Wisdom and his Word he has exposed and confuted every falsehood, and he has undercut all the assertions of false teachings by faith in the truth. For this reason the truth of God abounded in every falsehood which had been first asserted by men, by exposing the clandestine imitations and by handing down the simple truth of the faith in each individual doctrine. And in this manner the Apostle says that the truth of God abounded in the falsehood of men.36

{Rom 3:7}
18. There are innumerable other fictitious productions of men composed with dialectical reasoning and with fraudulent sophisms. But when the truth of God conquers each one of them by means of churchmen and those who have been instructed in the divine wisdom and when it refutes the snares of these arguments, the truth of God is said to abound in the falsehood of men, and not only to abound but to abound "to his glory." In my opinion this is to be understood in the following manner: Suppose a teacher of the Church gives instruction to certain simple hearers not yet occupied with false doctrines and, concerning each one of these, explains to them the rationale of divine truth. In instruction of this sort, the truth of God shall seem to abound. But if the discourse is given to those who resist the truth and who contradict words of sound doctrine46 and, while trying to contradict it, they find themselves confuted and proven wrong, so that when the darkness of their errors has been forsaken they come to the light of the truth, then not only will the truth of God abound, but it will abound to God's glory. For God is glorified through the one who, having been set free from the error of falsehood, has beheld the light of the truth. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 18.

{Rom 3:7-8}
19. The one who has understood these things in this manner will certainly not utter the foolish objection set forth in the following words, "Why am I still condemned as a sinner?" On the contrary he will understand that he is to be deservedly condemned if he remains in the falsehood of men. And, in accordance with what we have explained above, when convicted by the truth of God, he realizes that he has gone astray. And once he has turned from error, he glorifies the true God by his recognition of the truth. Such a person  does not commit blasphemy against those who proclaim the truth, when they say, for instance, "Let us do evil that good might come." For he knows that the damnation of the one blaspheming by such a word is just. One should also observe that he has stated that those who declare the truth of God are not so much "slandered," which applies to men, but "blasphemed," which pertains to God. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 1, par. 19.

{Rom 3:9}
2. We have already declared48 that in this letter Paul always tempers and balances his discourse as a kind of arbiter between those who had believed from the circumcision and those who believed from the Gentiles, so that sometimes he seems to accuse the one group of certain things, sometimes the other group. . . . For this reason, wanting next to encourage those whom he had humbled, he added, "Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much in every way. For in the first place they were entrusted with the oracles of God."50 After these things, since he had suitably followed up these things with others, he now goes on and says, "Then what advantage do we have? For we have charged that all Jews and Greeks are under sin." But if all are under sin, consequently there shall be no grounds for the self-exaltation of one group against the other since both come to salvation not on the basis of their own righteousness but on the basis of God's mercy.51 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 2, par. 2.

{Rom 3:9; Rom 1:22-24; Rom 2:17-19}
3. Therefore he accused certain Greeks, i.e., the Gentiles, of being under sin when he says, "For claiming to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of the image of corruptible man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles. Therefore God handed them over to a base mind,"52 and so forth. But he accuses the Jews when he says, "But if you call yourself a Jew and rest in the Law,"53 and so on, to which he adds, "You then who teach others do not teach yourself. You who preach against stealing steal,"54 etc. By means of these things, then, he says, "For we have charged that all Jews and Greeks are under sin." But after these things, as is his custom, he wants to affirm what he had said from the Holy Scriptures. Simultaneously he sets an example for teachers of the Church, that they too should set forth the things which are spoken to the people not as matters adopted as private opinions but as matters fortified by the divine testimonies.

{Rom 3:10; Ps 14:1-3}
5. Moreover what the Apostle says, "As it is written: There is no one who is righteous, there is no one who has understanding, there is no one who seeks God," is not found in the psalm with the same words, but some [words] are changed, some are introduced, and others are left out. . . . For you will find this done frequently in the Gospels as well.

{Ps 14:2-3; Ps 53:2; Ps 5:9; Ps 140:3; Ps 10:7; Prov 1:16; Isa 59:7-8}
6. In the Thirteenth Psalm, then, the following is written, "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if there is an understanding person who seeks God."58 But also in the Fifty-second Psalm it says this, "God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if there is an understanding person who seeks God."59 And clearly the identical sense is preserved in what the Apostle has stated, "There is no one who understands, there is no one who seeks God." And I think that what he said, "There is no one who is righteous," he has also taken from what is written, "There is no one who does goodness, not even one."60 There, although the wording seems to be changed, nevertheless one and the same sense is preserved. But what is said in what follows, "Their throat is an open grave, they use their tongues to deceive,"61 you will discover in the Fifth Psalm. After this he says, "The venom of vipers is under their lips," which I think is also taken from some psalm62 with changed wording as we have said above. But what follows, "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness"63 is clearly taken from the Ninth Psalm. Next, you will find, "Their feet are swift to shed blood" either in Isaiah or in the Proverbs.64 But I do not quite recall65 where "Contrition and misfortune are in their paths, and the way of peace they have not known" is written, but I suspect it can be found in one of the prophets.66 "There is no fear of God before their eyes" is written in the Psalms.67 Evidently he wanted to gather all these testimonies in order to show that what he is charging, namely that "all Jews and Greeks are under sin," is being declared not so much as his own opinion but as the thought of the Holy Scripture.

For even Paul says of himself, "But I was once alive without law."70 And when did Paul live without law, who says moreover concerning himself, "[I was] circumcised on the eighth day, a Hebrew born of Hebrews"?71 How then will it be true that he had lived at one time without law, this man who, eight days after his own birth, received the sign of circumcision from the Law?

{Rom 7:9}
8. Whence it is certain that a man comes under law at the time when he reaches the age when he can choose and discern what the Law is.72 He does not receive the yoke of any external law before he begins to have the strength of the internal natural law. After all, in the text where he said, "But I was once alive without law," he adds, "but when the commandment came, sin revived,"73 in which he shows that in childhood, before anyone has the capacity to distinguish between good and evil, one is said to be without law.74 Even if he sins, the sin is not imputed to him since there is no law in him.75 But when he receives the capacity for distinguishing between good and evil, it is said that the Law has come to him and has given commandments to him. But when the power of the commandment is within, i.e., the accusing conscience, it is said that sin, which formerly was dead in him, has revived. From this time on, then, if someone should submit himself to the Law of Moses so that he observes it according to the letter, he becomes an outward Jew. But if he follows it according to the spirit, he becomes a Jew in secret.76

For if Paul had been speaking of written law, that is, of the Law of Moses, when he said, "But sin is not imputed when there is no law,"80 then sin would not have been imputed to Cain or to those who died in the flood or to those who were consumed by fire in Sodom.81 But since we see that not only have sins been imputed to these people but that revenge was given to them, it is shown from this that Paul is speaking of natural law, which, with the exception of the first period of childhood, exists in all men.82 And thus he was quite justified in saying, "For we have charged that all Jews and Greeks are under sin." This is also why, to my way of thinking, it was not contrary to reason for certain sages to have stipulated that every type of mortal receives the ability to discern right and wrong when he arrives at the age when natural law enters his life. It is evil that gets aroused first of all, but afterward it is gradually driven out by means of instruction, education, and exhortation; and it passes over to virtue.83 For it seems to me that Paul as well has perceived what is in accord with these things in that which he says, "But when the commandment came, sin revived."84 In fact the Savior too, when he says in the Gospels, "If I would not have come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin,"85 will seem to have spoken according to this understanding, that by the power with which he is said to fill the world,86 he comes to each man and speaks in his heart and teaches him discretion of good and evil.87

{Rom 3:10-12; Ps 143:2; Ezek 16:51-52}
10. So then, this is why Paul says that it is written, "There is no one who is righteous, no one who has understanding, there is no one who seeks God; all have turned away, together they have become worthless," just as the prophet says elsewhere, "No one living will be justified in your sight."88 This may perhaps appear contrary to other Scriptures which bear witness to many persons, partially righteous to such a degree that it could even be said to Jerusalem in reference to the Sodomites, "Sodom has been justified because of you."89 But consider very carefully the caution of Holy Scripture, that it has not said, "Sodom has been justified," but it says, "because you [Jerusalem] are committing many wicked deeds and what you are doing is of such a nature that you surpass everyone in the magnitude of your sins, in comparison with your crimes, now even Sodom should be justified."90  [Ezek. 16:51-52]

{Ps 143:2; Rev 5:3-5; Rev 3:7; Jn 5:19}
11.  So then, in what he has said here, "No one living will be justified in your sight," he did not mean for this to be understood in the sense that no one living will be justified, but "in your sight," that is to say, no one will be justified in God's sight. For however just someone may be, however holy he may be, not only among men but even among the higher and more eminent creatures, it is certain that in comparison with God he cannot be justified.91 For even in the Apocalypse of John when the sealed book is brought into the presence of the Ancient of Days92 and someone who is able to open it is sought from every tribe, tongue, and people, no one was found except the lamb from the tribe of Judah, who was justified in the sight of God. And he alone deserved to open the book, for he alone is the one "who opens and no one closes; he closes and no one opens."93 Therefore our Savior alone, the Lord Jesus Christ, is justified in the sight of the Father, since "whatever the Father does, even that the Son does likewise."94 But every creature is justified in comparison with inferiors.95 Thus we might say, for example, that in comparison with the rest of the people, Miriam, the sister of Moses, was just. And again, in comparison with Miriam, Aaron was just. And again, compared with Aaron, Moses was just. But blessed is he who is called just in comparison with better things and not in comparison with what is worse, as was Sodom, which is recorded to have been justified in comparison with Jerusalem.96 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 2, par. 11.

{Rom 2:26-27; Rev 2:14-16}
12. For this reason I am apprehensive, because of us who seem to be in the Church of God and who apply ourselves to his law and who are in devoted service to the precepts of the Gospel, some unbelievers might be found who ought to be justified. For example, I would say that if we are enslaved to lust and impurity, whereas the pagan, who is a stranger to faith in Christ, preserves chastity, then that pagan is justified because of us.

{Rom 3:10; Ps 143:2; Sir 11:28; Wis 2:17; Job 23:8; Mt 12:45; Lk 11:26; Eccl 4:2-3; Mt 11:11}
13. Yet it is possible to explain in still another way what he has said, "There is no one who is righteous," or what he said, "no one living will be justified in your sight."97 For as long as a person lives in the body, he cannot be justified or declared righteous, but when he departs from the body and leaves the struggle of this life, as the Scripture also says, "Do not pronounce a man happy before death since you do not know what his end shall be";98 [Sir 11.28; Wis 2.17; Jb 23.8; Mt 12.45; Lk 11.26.] and again as Ecclesiastes says, "And I praised all the dead, who have already died, more than the living, who are still alive; but better than both is the one who has not yet been born."99 [Ecc 4:2-3] Moreover, you have still another scriptural statement which says that whoever is least in the kingdom of God is greater than the one who is in the body, even if it be John himself, than whom there was no one greater among those born of women.100 [Mt 11:11]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 2, par. 13.

{Rom 3:10-11; 1 Cor 13:9-12; Wis 9:14-18}
14. Therefore "there is no one who is righteous." He says additionally, "there is no one who has understanding." And in truth, seeing that the Apostle himself claims to know in part and to understand in part,101 who will there be who would be called "one who has understanding"? For to whatever extent one does understand, he shall appear to understand as in a mirror and in a riddle;102 since it is only after the laying aside of the earthly body that a man is preserved to understand face to face.103 For the present time, however, it is indeed as the Scripture says, "A corruptible body weighs down the soul, and this earthy tent depresses the thoughtful mind,"104 from which it follows that "there is no one who has understanding" and "no one who seeks God." For as long as we are occupied with the troubles of the body and we seek things which pertain to men, we cannot seek God or be mindful of the things which pertain to God.105 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 2, par. 14.

{Rom 3:12; Rom 5:12; Lk 17:10; Mt 25:23}
1. All have turned aside, together they have become worthless.106 It seems to me that no one could be said to have turned aside except one who, at one time, stood on the right path. From this observation it is clear that the original work of the rational nature which was made by God had been upright107 and was set on the right path as a gift of its Creator. But because he turned away from this to the wayward road of sin, he is now justly said to have turned aside.108 There is, for example, the case of the first man, Adam, who turned aside from the right road in Paradise, by the seductive deception of the serpent, to the wrong and tortuous paths of mortal life. Consequently then, all who come into this world in succession from Adam have turned aside and together with him have become worthless. I think it is also on this account that the Lord gives the command in the Gospels that when we have done everything which we have been instructed to do, we should nevertheless remember what we are and we should say, "We are worthless servants, we have done what we ought to have done!"109 For as long as someone does only what he ought, that is to say, what has been commanded him, he is a worthless servant. But if you should add to what has been commanded then you will no longer be a worthless servant but it will be said to you, "Well done, good and faithful servant!"110 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 3, par. 1.

{Mt 25:23; 1 Cor 7:25; 1 Cor 9:15}
1. (cont.) [But if you should add to what has been commanded then you will no longer be a worthless servant but it will be said to you, "Well done, good and faithful servant!"]110   Now just what that is which may be added to the things commanded and made to surpass obligation, the Apostle Paul tells us, "Now concerning virgins, I do not have a command of the Lord: but I give counsel as one who has attained mercy from God."111 This work goes beyond the command.112 Therefore whoever has fulfilled the commands and adds to them this as well, that he preserves the state of virginity, he is no longer a worthless servant but will be called a good and faithful one. Moreover there is the command that those who proclaim the gospel should earn their living from the gospel. Yet Paul says, "I have made use of none of these things."113 On that account he was not a worthless servant but a faithful and wise one.114 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 3, par. 1.

{Rom 3:12; Jn 10:11}
2. Therefore, "All have turned aside, together they have become worthless." To this he has added, "There is no one who does goodness, there is not even one." This is a severe judgment which could be alleged only with difficulty. For how does it appear to possibly be that no one at all, not even one single person among the Jews and among the Greeks, can be found who does goodness? Are we thus to believe that there has been no one who has received a guest at some time or who has given bread to a hungry man or has clothed a naked person115 or has rescued the innocent from the hands of the mighty116 or has carried out some other kind of good work? It does not seem to me that the Apostle Paul wanted to make such an incredible assertion. But in my opinion when he denies that anyone has done goodness, we should understand him in the following way: Suppose, for instance, someone should lay the foundations of a house and construct one or two walls, maybe even bring in some of the building material. Will he be said to have built the house, even though he seems to have worked on the house? On the contrary a man is said to have made a house who completely builds each individual section of the entire structure. It is in this way, I think, that the Apostle is saying here that no one has done goodness: He means that no one has brought it to perfection and entire completion. But if we ask, who is truly good and who has done perfect goodness, we shall find only him who says, "I am the good shepherd," and again, "The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep."117 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 3, par. 2.

{Rom 3:13; Ps 5:9; Mt 23:25-28; Mt 12:34}
3. After these things he, citing from the Fifth Psalm as we said above,118 says, "their throat is an open grave."119 By these words he is describing the various sins of the human race, as it seems to me. Every grave covers the defilement of a dead corpse. The Lord also spoke of this in the Gospel concerning the scribes and Pharisees, that they were white-washed graves which indeed outwardly appear beautiful to men but within are filled with every defilement.120 But Paul seems to be indicating in this passage some greater crime in those concerning whom he is writing. For he calls them not covered or concealed, but open graves. For they are called closed graves who are prevented from sinning openly and bringing forth their crimes into the public by even a small amount of decency. But they are called open graves who publicly display their defilement and impurities. In such persons the constant repetition and practice of wicked deeds, which is the ultimate of evils, has removed from them even the sense of shame of their crimes. Thus, no longer do they open their mouths and express the word of God, the living word,121 but instead they open their throats and express the dead word, the word of the devil, not from the heart but from the grave.122 Whenever you see someone with a lascivious mouth uttering shameless words, or expressing insults and abuses with an arrogant and frenzied mouth, do not hesitate to say of such a person, "his throat is an open grave." "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."123 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 3, par. 3.

{Rom 3:13; 1 Pet 2:22}
4. To these things is added, "They use their tongues to deceive." Deceit is when one speaks one thing with the tongue and ponders something else in his heart.124 I do not know if even those who are righteous and chosen may remain immune from this fault. I do think, however, that one person may be more prone to this fault, another less prone, but no one is cleansed from it to the point of perfection except he alone, of whom it is written, "He committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth."125 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 3, par. 4.

{Rom 3:13}
1. The venom of vipers is under their lips.127 The serpent's bite kills the body by its venom; the bite of a venomous word kills the soul by its deceit. This can happen through those who deceive men by the invention of false accusations; it can also occur through those who deceive the souls of the simple with heretical doctrine, infected by the devil's poison. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 4, par. 1.

{Rom 3:14}
2. "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."128 . . . For who exists whose mouth is so pure that habit does not provoke him to cursing, I do not mean against those who are deserving of being cursed, but even against those whom the Lord has not cursed,129 that is to say, against righteous and innocent men? This flaw of human frailty is common and habitual, especially towards inferiors and those in subjection, so much so that they no longer consider this kind of name-calling to be cursing. That is why it is said that their mouths are full and that cursing flows out incessantly, as it were, from the full vessel of the mouth. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 4, par. 2.

{Rom 3:15; Rom 3:9}
3. In what follows he adds, "Their feet are swift to shed blood."132 It will perhaps appear that this crime cannot be applied to many of those concerning whom he has said, "For we have charged that all Jews and Greeks are under sin." Unless perchance we should understand that it is not so much physically that the blood of those whose bodies are slain is shed, but also those who separate the soul from God by any stumbling block whatsoever are called "men of blood." For just as a man is called a murderer who separates the body from the soul, through which it is vivified, how much more truly should he be called a murderer who separates the soul from the true life, which is God?133

{Rom 3:16; Ps 49:12-20; Ps 51:17}
1. Contrition and misfortune are in their paths, and the way of peace they have not known.136 He is not speaking here of that contrition by which the sinner's spirit is afflicted because of penitence, of which it is said in the Psalms, "God does not despise a humble and contrite heart."137 Rather he is speaking of that contrition by which sinners are said to destroy the yoke of the Lord and cast it from their necks.138 Likewise "misfortune" or, as another reading says, "misery" must be taken to refer to the man who has become miserable and unfortunate, who "while he was in honor did not understand" but "became like the foolish beasts and has become like them."139 [Ps 49:12-20]

(2) "And the way of peace they have not known."140 Our peace is Christ.141 The way of peace, then, is the way of Christ. . . . Furthermore, that people which was led out of Egypt advanced along the way of peace in order to come to the Promised Land and dwell in Jerusalem, which is interpreted "Vision of Peace."143 As the prophet also says, "His place has been established in peace and his dwelling is in Zion."144 Now whoever strives for a dwelling in the heavenly Jerusalem knows the way of peace more fully as he ascends to the holy city of the living God.145

{Rom 3:18}
3. After these things he adds, "There is no fear of God before their eyes."146 If there is anyone who always contemplates the fear of God and who seeks to know what is pleasing or displeasing to him, of such a person it is said that the fear of God is before his eyes. But he must be experienced and diligently trained in the Law of the Lord,147 lest he greatly fear where fear would not be necessary.148 The fear of God, then, should always be placed before the eyes, not the fleshly eyes-for nothing visible or bodily is intended here-but he is speaking about the eyes of the mind.

{Rom 3:9}
4. We have arranged these things according to our ability in each of the individual matters taken up by Paul, as it seemed appropriate to the matters about which he wrote, "For we have charged that all Jews and Greeks are under sin." In my opinion this ought to be understood not in the sense that every human being is proven guilty of all these crimes, but rather, one person is charged in one matter, another in another; yet this is such that in everyone the whole universe is filled with vices. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 5, par. 4.

{Rom 3:19-20; Rom 3:4; Gen 4:13[LXX]; Gen 42:21[LXX]; Job 31:33-34 [LXX]; Rom 7:9}
1. Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be shut, and the whole world may be subjected to God. Therefore no flesh will be justified in the sight of God by works of the law. For through law comes the knowledge of sin.156 We have previously said in the preface that the Apostle was going to be discussing several kinds of law in this epistle. . . . Consequently in the present passage as well, which says, "We know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law," we need to examine carefully which law he means is spoken to those who are under the law, and through which it says to them that it strips them of every excuse so that they are not able to find any excuse for their own sins. For this is what he says, "so that every mouth may be shut, and the whole world may be subjected to God." Now suppose we want to understand this of the Law of Moses which, it is scarcely to be doubted, speaks only to those whom it obligated to be circumcised at birth and whom it instructed. How shall it appear consistent that through this law, which governs one nation only in its stipulations, every mouth is shut and through it the whole world is held accountable to God? For what are we to believe? That all the Gentiles and the whole world share this law in common? Moreover, how is it said that the knowledge of sin comes through the Law of Moses when very many individuals may be found who knew their sin even before the Law of Moses existed?158 Cain, after all, when he had sinned, said the following, "My sin is too great that I may be forgiven."159 Moreover the patriarchs, when they had gone down to Joseph in Egypt and were incited by him by means of a feigned accusation, say to one another, "We are in sins on account of our brother; for we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, but we did not listen to him. That is why this affliction has come upon us."160 But Job too, who is acknowledged to have lived before the Law,161 says the following, "If I have sinned unintentionally, if I have hidden my sin, or if I have been intimidated before the multitude of people to declare my fault."162 All these individuals are plainly shown to have recognized their sin. Consequently it is concluded from this that the Apostle Paul is not speaking about the Law of Moses, that "the law speaks to those who are under the law," but instead about natural law, which is written in men's hearts. Whatever this law says, then, it says to those who are under the law. Those who are at the time of life at which they have already received the ability to distinguish good and evil are under this law. But those whose minds have not yet reached the point of discretion are "without law," according to what Paul also says, "I was once alive without law."163 The Apostle will appear to have spoken reasonably, in accordance with natural law, that every mouth should be shut and the whole world will be accountable to the judgment of God. For there is no one who does not have experience of this law, which is naturally innate within men, both Jews and Gentiles. Therefore the statement, "God might be justified in his words and prevail when he is judged," also appears to have been reasonably said.164 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 6, par. 1.

{Rom 2:14-15; Acts 17:27}
2.  One finds that God has in fact given to man every disposition and every drive by which he can press forward and advance toward virtue. Over and above the power of reason God has ensured that man should know what he ought to do and what he ought to avoid.165 One finds then that God has supplied these things universally to all men.166 But if a man who has received these things has disdained to advance upon the road of virtue, this man, to whom nothing was lacking from God, is found to be lacking in what is given to him by God. Deservedly, then, God is said to prevail in such a judgment and to be justified in his words.167 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 6, par. 2.

{Jude 6; 1 Cor 6:3; Ezek 4:1}
4. What now needs to be considered is whether this law binds not only human beings but also angels and every rational creature of whatever sort. . . . Surely they also have instruction that certain things must be observed and certain things are to be avoided. And unless they were bound by this law, Holy Scripture would never have said about them, "Even angels who did not keep their original state, but left their proper dwelling, God has kept bound in eternal chains in deepest darkness in Tartarus for the judgment of the great day."169 . . . Moreover, when Paul says, "Do you not know that we will judge angels?"170 of what else is he expressing knowledge than of the fact that these too, whom he declares should be brought before the judgment, stand under law?171 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 6, par. 4.

{Rom 8:7-8; Isa 40:6; Jn 6:63; Rom 3:20}
7. Carefully observe the sense in which the Apostle has said, "no flesh is justified by works of the law." For works of the law concern those who are in the flesh, but the meaning of the law pertains to those who are in the spirit, that is to say, to higher orders of heavenly offices. "By works of the law, therefore, shall no flesh be justified in his sight," should be understood, in my opinion, that nothing that is flesh and that lives according to the flesh can be justified by the law of God.184 Just as the same Apostle says elsewhere, "Those who are in the flesh cannot please God,"185 and again in another passage, "For the wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God; for it is not subjected to God's law-indeed it cannot be."186 The prophet also says, "All flesh is grass";187 and in the Gospel it is written, "It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing."188 It is based upon such things, then, that he says that from the law of God "no flesh will be justified before Him."189 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 6, par. 7.

{Job 25:5; Rom 3:20}
8. Moreover you should not casually pass over the added words, "before Him," as I have already frequently warned,190 since to be justified before God is different from being justified before men. That is to say, in comparison with other men, one man can be deemed just if he has lived relatively free from faults; but in comparison with God, not only is a man not justified, but as even Job says, "But the stars are not pure before him."191 They are certainly pure to us. That is, in comparison with men they are deemed pure and holy; but they are not able to be pure in comparison with God.192 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 6, par. 8.

{Rom 3:20; Rom 7:12}
(9) "Through the Law," he says, "comes the knowledge of sin." Let us see how the knowledge of sin comes through the Law. While we learn193 through the Law what is to be done and what is to be avoided, at the same time we acquire the knowledge both of what sin is and what it is not. Then it is not the case, as the heretics accuse the God of the Law, that the Law is a bad root and a bad tree194 through which the knowledge of sin comes.195 For he has not said, "from the Law comes the knowledge of sin," but, "through the Law," so that you might know that sin did not arise from it but is known through it. Suppose, for instance, we were to say: Through the art of medicine is given the knowledge of sickness.196 You don't think, do you, that medical science will be deemed to be the cause of sickness just because by means of it the nature of sickness is recognized? But just as it is indisputable that medical science is a good thing since it offers understanding of illness by which the one who wills can avoid illness, so also the Law is good, through which means sin is detected and known.197

{Rom 3:19}
2. In the above discussion201 we asserted that not about the Law of Moses was it said, "Whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law."202 Now someone will think that this was asserted in violation of the text rather than said truly, since he now sees that the term "law" refers not to the law of nature but to that of Moses. . . . This much he would say, he who would charge that the Apostle's meaning, in these passages we have interpreted above, has been violently twisted by us. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 2.

{Rom 3:20-24}
4. We shall therefore attempt to show even in the present passage how his subsequent statement is not inconsistent with my former explanation. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 4.

{Rom 3:20-24; Rom 11:33}
5. We have often said, and we clearly demarcated this point in the Preface,208 that the Apostle mentions many kinds of law in this epistle in such a way that when he passes from one kind to another it is scarcely possible for this to be detected except by a reader who is sufficiently attentive. Up above he had said that through law comes the knowledge of sin. But now he has sensed that it is possible for someone to respond to him: "Well then, if the knowledge of sin comes from natural law, the knowledge of righteousness can come from it as well, following the example of the medical arts which we gave above." . . . When he had seen, then, that this could be raised as an objection, he joins to the words he had previously said, "For through the [natural] law comes the knowledge of sin," the following, "But now apart from [natural] law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed."210 . . . For the law of nature was able to reveal the nature of sin and bring to light the knowledge of sin; but the righteousness of God surpasses and rises above whatever the human mind can scrutinize by natural senses alone. . . . For the righteousness of God and his judgments are so profound that the Apostle says, "How unsearchable are the judgments of God."212 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 5.

{Wis 1:1; Ps 2:10; Rom 3:21}
6. Moreover, wisdom also speaks this way to men, as if the righteousness of God cannot be known by the impulses of nature alone but must be sought through the study of doctrine; and for this reason it says, "Learn righteousness, you who judge the earth!"213 [Wis 1:1; Ps 2:10] Wherefore the law of nature will be of no help whatsoever for knowing God's righteousness, though it appears to understand something about human righteousness. . . . Therefore the Apostle says, "But now, apart from the law," i.e. of nature, "the righteousness of God has been disclosed,"216 having the attestation of the Law of Moses and of the Prophets, in whom the Holy Spirit had recorded many things about God's righteousness through figures and enigmas.217 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 6.

{Rom 3:21; Jn 4:35}
7. I don't want you to be surprised that the single term "law," which is found twice in the very same passage, should signify different things. We find this to be customary in the Scripture even in other passages like here, "Do you not say, 'Four months more, then comes the harvest?' Lift up your eyes and 
see the fields, that they are already white for harvest."218 Does not the word "harvest," which is named twice in this passage, refer in the first instance to the material harvest but in the second instance to the spiritual? Again in the Gospel when the Savior says to the Samaritan woman. . . . So then in the present passage as well, when the Apostle says that the righteousness of God is disclosed apart from law, the law of nature is understood; but when he says, "attested by the Law and the Prophets" he is referring to the Law of Moses. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 7.

{Rom 3:21; Rom 7:14}
 (8) But if you still think that what we have said is not yet complete, we shall add the following as well. Suppose it seems to anyone that it is one and the same law about which he says, "But now, apart from law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed," which is also that law about which he says, "attested by the Law and the Prophets." Well then, if God's righteousness has been disclosed apart from Law [i.e., the Law of Moses], then it does not receive attestation from the Law [of Moses]. But if it does receive attestation from the Law [of Moses], then it has not been disclosed apart from the Law [of Moses]. Because these phrases are inseparable and cannot be severed on any rational grounds, then the righteousness of God must be said to be disclosed by Christ Jesus. Jesus attests to it, not in the law of nature, which is undoubtedly small and scanty, but in the Law of Moses. Yet, not the Law of Moses according to the letter, but according to the spirit-of which the same Apostle says, "For the Law is spiritual."224 But it is likewise attested in the Prophets through him who spoke in them, the Spirit of God. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 8.

{Rom 3:21}
9. There is moreover a noteworthy distinction made by the Apostle in relation to this expression, if one observes very carefully. It is customary in Greek to place arthra before nouns. [Rufinus: Among us Latins, these might be called "articles."] Thus whenever Paul wants to designate the Law of Moses, he customarily places an article before it; but when he wants natural law to be understood, he designates "law" without the article.225 And so in this passage where he says, "But now, apart from law, the righteousness of God has been disclosed," "law" does not have an article. But in what follows where he says, "attested by the Law and the Prophets," in this second passage he has cited law with an article. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 9.

{Rom 3:21; 1 Cor 1:30; Jn 5:39}
10. If then the matter about the diverse meanings of the term "law" has become sufficiently clear, let us now see which righteousness is supposed to be disclosed apart from natural law. The Apostle Paul himself says elsewhere of Christ that "he has become for us wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness and redemption."226 This righteousness of God, therefore, which is Christ, is indeed disclosed apart from the natural law, but not apart from the Law of Moses or the Prophets. For the Law testifies to it just as he himself says, "You search the Scriptures, and they are those which offer testimony about me."227 For the natural law can indeed supply explanations and give understanding, as we have said,228 either of the things which equity demands to be done among men or by its perception that God exists. But who can perceive from nature alone that Christ is the Son of God? It is therefore apart from this law that the righteousness of God, which is Christ,229 has been disclosed, attested by the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 10.

{Rom 3:21; Eph 5:14; Mt 10:26}
11. But before we hasten to what comes next, it seems that even this observation ought not be omitted: he has put "knowledge" in relation to sin but "disclosure" [pephanerotai] in respect to righteousness. "Foreverything which is disclosed is light."230 [Eph 5:14] And if what is disclosed is light, sin, which is not light, is not disclosed, but is known. It is in this way I understand the following passage, "Nothing is concealed which will not be disclosed, nothing is covered which will not be revealed."231 [Mt 10:26] 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 11.

{Rom 3:21}
12. The Law and the Prophets then are witnesses of the righteousness of God; this righteousness is disclosed through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe, among whom there is no distinction whether they believe as Jews or as Gentiles.232 Notice, however, that he does not put down to faith alone the single cause of the disclosure of the righteousness of God, but he associates with it both the Law and the Prophets. The reason for this is that faith alone, apart from the Law and the Prophets, does not disclose the righteousness of God. Nor, on the other hand, do the Law and the Prophets disclose it apart from faith. Thus the one is rooted in the other so that perfection comes from both.233 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 12.

{Rom 3:21-22; Ps 50:16; Eccl 15:9}
(13) He says there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks since it is certain that all equally have come under sin, as became clear above.234 And he says that now the righteousness of God, which is supported by testimonies in the Law and the Prophets, has also been given equally to all through faith in Jesus Christ. But because all had come under sin, doubtless they were likewise estranged from the glory of God because they were able neither to receive it in any respect whatsoever nor to merit it. For how would a sinner dare to give glory to God, to whom the prophet says, "But God has said to the sinner: 'Why do you recite my righteous requirements'?"235 And again another Scripture says, "Praise is unseemly in the mouth of a sinner."236 Therefore the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ reaches to all who believe, whether they are Jews or Greeks. It justifies those who have been cleansed from their past crimes and makes them capable of receiving the glory of God; and it supplies this glory not for the sake of their merits nor for the sake of works, but freely to those who believe.237 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 13.

{Rom 3:24; 1 Cor 1:30; 1 Pet 1:18-19}
14. "Through the redemption," he says, "which is in Christ Jesus."238 Let us look carefully at the meaning of "redemption which is in Christ Jesus." The term "redemption" [apolytrosis] refers to that which is given to enemies for those whom they are keeping in captivity, in order that they might restore them to their original freedom.239 [My note: "redemption" should probably be translated as "ransom" here.] Captives conquered by sin, as if by war, were being held fast, then, by the enemies of the human race. The Son of God came, who "has become for us" not only "wisdom from God and righteousness and holiness" but also "redemption."240 He gave himself as the redemption price,241 that is to say, he handed himself over to the enemies and, what is more, poured out his own blood to those thirsting for it;242 and this is the redemption accomplished for those who believe, just as Peter also writes in his epistle when he says, "You were redeemed not with perishable silver or gold, but with the precious blood of the only begotten Son of God."243 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 14.

{Prov 13:8; 1 Cor 1:30}
14. (cont.) Perhaps even Solomon was describing this under a mystery when he said, "The redemption price of a man's soul is his own wealth."244 [Prov 13:8] For if you ask what the wealth of the soul is, you will discover that its wealth is wisdom, righteousness, and holiness. But the Apostle says that Christ is all these things.245 Christ then is the soul's wealth and therefore he himself is the soul's redemption price.246 For material wealth ought to be regarded as the ruin of the soul rather than its redemption price, unless it should be converted into good works and becomes righteousness and mercy and is transformed from material wealth into the wealth of the soul. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 7, par. 14.

{Rom 3:25-26}
1. Whom God pre-determined 247 as a propitiation through faith in his blood, as a manifestation of his righteousness, through the remission of previously committed sins, in the forbearance of God, as a manifestation of his righteousness in this time, that he himself might be just in justifying him who is from faith in Jesus Christ.248 . . . Now the Apostle has added something even more profound and says, "God pre-determined him as a propitiation through faith in his blood."252 This means of course that through the sacrifice of himself 253 he would make God propitious to men and through this he would manifest his own righteousness as he forgives them their past sins, which they had contracted by serving the worst tyrants at the time when God was tolerating and allowing this to be done. God allowed this so that afterwards, i.e., at this time, he would manifest his own righteousness. For at the consummation of the age,254 at the end of time, God disclosed his own righteousness and, for the redemption price, gave him whom he made a propitiator. . . . For God is just, and the one who is just could not justify the unjust. For that reason he wanted there to be the mediation of a propitiator so that those who were not able to be justified through their own works might be justified through faith in him. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 8, par. 1.

{Rom 3:25-26; Ex 25:17}
2. But now, in keeping with our custom, let us endeavor to ascertain what the inner meaning of the apostolic discourse may contain. First of all, in what manner was it said, "Whom God predetermined as a propitiation," or propitiator,* "through faith in his blood"? It is certain that in nearly every passage, the Apostle's meaning flows from the treasure chambers of the Law and the Prophets. Let us inquire then where he may have found the term "propitiation" [hilasterion] and from which passage he may have taken this word. I recall that in Exodus the Lord was speaking to Moses and was instructing him in what he was supposed to do. First he orders an ark to be made along with carrying poles and rings through the sides of the ark.257 After this he says, "And you shall make a hilasterion of pure gold; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and one cubit and a half its width. And you shall make two golden cherubim out of hammered work, and you shall place them over the two ends of the hilasterion, one cherub at the one end, and the other cherub at the other end of the hilasterion. . . . There I will become known to you, and from above the hilasterion, from between the two cherubim that are on the ark of the covenant, I will speak to you according to all which I will command you for the sons of Israel."258 [Ex. 25:17-22] It seemingly appears that the Apostle found the word "hilasterion" in this passage and now has recorded it in his own writings, of which our current discourse is speaking. It also seems that this hilasterion which had been written about in Exodus referred to nothing other than the Savior and Lord since it says, "God pre-determined him as a hilasterion through faith."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 8, par. 2.

{Rom 3:25-26; Ex 25:17; 1 Cor 2:10; Col 2:3} 
5. It can therefore be understood as the hilasterion in accordance with what we have said above. Over it two cherubim are said to have been placed, one on one end and one on the other end.269 What figure then should be understood to be contained in the two cherubim? For "cherubim," when translated into our language, means "the fullness of knowledge."270 Where then would we say there is a fullness of knowledge if not in him of whom the Apostle says, "In whom are hidden the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"?271 Surely the Apostle is saying these things about the Word of God. Moreover, he writes similar things about the Holy Spirit when he says, "But God has revealed it to us through his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God."272 [1 Cor 2:10] Therefore he signifies, as I think, that the Word of God, who is the only begotten Son, and his Holy Spirit always dwell in the hilasterion, that is, in the soul of Jesus, and that is what the two cherubim placed over the hilasterion indicate.273 Moreover, notice that he has not said "one cherub at the right end and the other cherub at the left end," but it says, "one cherub at one end and the other cherub at the other end"274 in order to show that in the hilasterion, that is in the soul of Jesus, there was nothing evil.275 
275. Sinistrum means both "left" and "evil." The Greek euonymos, "well-named," is itself a euphemism and expresses what is unlucky. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 8, par. 5.

{Hebrews, author}
11. Now of hilasterion enough has already been said. But of the priesthood both David, in the Psalms, and the Apostle Paul, in Hebrews, plainly write.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 8, par. 11.

{Rom 3:25-26; Ex 25:17; 1 Jn 2:1-2}
12. But lest it appear to you that Paul alone has dared to use the term hilasterion in reference to Christ, listen to how John speaks with an understanding concordant to this when he says, "My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin, and if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins, not for ours only but also for the whole world."300 With one and the same understanding, then, the apostles designate Christ as the hilasterion.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 8, par. 12.

{Rom 3:25-26}
14. It is "God's forbearance" when a sinner is not at once punished when he sins, but instead, in accordance with what the same Apostle has said, is led by God's patience to repentance;311 and in this God is said to manifest his own righteousness. However it says well in addition, "at this time"; for in the present age God's righteousness comes with forbearance, but in the future age it will come with retribution. For God has deemed it just to commit the present age to forbearance and patience, since the future age has been appointed for judgment. For if he were to punish the sinner in this present time, he would not seem just to call forth again to judgment the one whom he had already punished. But if he shows forbearance and exercises patience in the present age he will rightly be a just judge in the future.312 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 8, par. 14.

{Rom 3:27-28}
1. Where then is your boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Through that of works? No, but through the Law of faith. For we hold that a man is justified through faith without works of the Law.315 Once again, we often remind those who desire to give careful attention to the things Paul has written . . . For if a trifling bit should escape the reader's attention, immediately the extremely narrow path to understanding will be thrown into disorder. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 1.

{Rom 3:27-28}
2. Therefore, the Apostle had made known above what advantage the Jew possessed and what value there was in circumcision and he had taught that the oracles of God were first entrusted to them.317 And by these words he had seemed to be eliciting boasting from [the Jews], with which they were accustomed to raise themselves up against the Gentiles. . . . In this current passage, the Apostle, as if establishing the conclusion of his previous arguments, now says, "Where then is your boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? That of works? No, but through the Law of faith. For we hold that a man is justified through faith without works of law." He is saying that the justification of faith alone suffices, so that the one who only believes is justified, even if he has not accomplished a single work.319 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 2.

{Rom 3:27-28; Lk 23:42-43}
3. It is incumbent upon us, therefore, as those who are attempting to defend the harmoniousness of the Apostle's writings and to establish that they are entirely consistent in their arrangement,320 that we should ask: "Who has been justified by faith alone without works of the law?" Thus, in my opinion, that thief who was crucified with Christ should suffice for a suitable example. He called out to him from the cross, "Lord Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!"322 In the Gospels nothing else is recorded about his good works, but for the sake of this faith alone Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you: Today you will be with me in paradise."323 If it seems appropriate, let us now apply the words of the Apostle Paul to the case of this thief and say to the Jews, "Where then is your boasting?" Certainly it is excluded, but excluded not through the law of works but through the law of faith. For through faith this thief was justified without works of the law, since the Lord did not require in addition to this that he should first accomplish works, nor did he wait for him to perform some works when he had believed. But by his confession alone the one who was about to begin his journey to paradise received him as a justified traveling companion with himself. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 3.

{Lk 7:37-38}
4. Moreover there is the case of that woman concerning whom it is mentioned in the Gospel according to Luke, "When she learned that Jesus was reclining in the Pharisee's house, she brought a jar of ointment. . . . It was on the basis of no work of the Law but for the sake of faith alone that he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven you";325 and again, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."326 Furthermore in many passages of the Gospel we read that the Savior has used this phrase to say that the faith of the believer is the cause of his salvation.327 From all of these things he is making clear that the Apostle is correct to hold that a man is justified through faith without works of law. But perhaps someone who hears these things should become lax and negligent in doing good, if in fact faith alone suffices for him to be justified. To this person we shall say that if anyone acts unjustly after justification, it is scarcely to be doubted that he has rejected the grace of justification.328 For a person does not receive the forgiveness of sins in order that he should once again imagine he has been given a license to sin; for the remission is not given for future crimes, but only past ones.329 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 4.

{Rom 3:27-28; 1 Cor 15:10}
5. Now then let us return to our theme. A human being is justified through faith; the works of the law contribute nothing to his being justified. But where there is no faith which justifies the believer, even if one possesses works from the law, nevertheless because they have not been built upon the foundation of faith,330 although they might appear to be good things, nevertheless they are not able to justify the one doing them, because from them faith is absent, which is the sign of those who are justified by God.331 This is what we have said above,332 "Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness."333 So much so is this the case that according to Paul the one who is justified through the grace of faith says, "For the grace of God which was given to me was not without effect."334 Therefore all boasting which comes from the works of the law is excluded. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 5.

{Lk 18:9-10; 1 Cor 2:2; 1 Cor 1:31}
6. In order that what we are saying might become even clearer, we shall cite an example from those which are recorded in the Gospel. "A Pharisee and a tax collector went up to the temple of God. And the Pharisee," it says, "standing in the middle, was saying, God, I thank you that I am not like other men: thieves, the unjust, adulterers, or like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of everything I possess,"335 and so on. Very possibly the Pharisee was speaking the truth when he said these things; yet in the Lord's opinion this man, who was corrupted by the vice of ostentatious boasting, did not go down from the temple a justified man. Such boasting then, which was coming from the works of the Law, is excluded, because it does not embrace the humility of the cross of Christ. Listen to what one says who boasts in the cross, "May I never boast except in the cross of my Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."336 You see that the 
Apostle does not boast about his own righteousness nor about chastity nor about wisdom nor about his other virtues and deeds, but he declares with the utmost openness and says, "Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 6.

{Rom 3:27-28; Mt 5:28; 1 Cor 1:21; 1 Cor 1:27; Isa 64:6}
7. And so, Judaic boasting is excluded, not through the Law of works but through the Law of faith, which is in Christ Jesus, in whose cross the Apostle boasts. For who will legitimately boast about his own chastity when he reads what is written, "anyone who has looked at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"?337 This is why the prophet also says, "How will someone boast that his heart is pure?"338 Or who will boast about his wisdom when he observes that it is written, "The world through wisdom did not know God; and therefore God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe,"339 and again, "God chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise"?340 And who will boast about his own righteousness when he hears God saying through the prophet, "all your righteousness is like the rag of a menstruous woman."** The only just boasting then is based upon faith in the cross of Christ, which excludes all boasting that derives from the works of the Law.342 
**My footnote: I'm guessing that Luther picked up this otherwise obscure verse from Origen's commentary. Of course, Luther extracted from Romans a rather different message than did Origen.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 7.

{Rom 3:27-28; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 8:1-2}
8. We have said these things because the Apostle has stated, as if in the language of an investigator, "Where then is your boasting?" And to this question he has given himself the answer, "It is excluded." And again, as though he were interrogating, he says, "Through what law? That of works?" And he responds to himself, "No, but through the Law of faith. For we hold that a man is justified through faith without works of the Law." We have already spoken about these matters above. But he again makes mention of two laws even in this present passage. He says the "law of works" and the "law of faith." You who read should consider whether this expression ought to be applied to the Law of Moses and the natural law, or to the Law of the letter and the Law of the spirit; for the Law of the letter kills and works death,343 but the Law of the spirit of life sets free from the law of sin and death.344 He therefore appropriately adds in what follows: 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 9, par. 8.

{Rom 3:29-30}
1. Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also. Since God is one who will justify the circumcision from faith and the uncircumcision through faith.345 . . . For the very same God justifies members of both peoples who believe, and this is based not upon the privilege of circumcision or uncircumcision but in consideration of faith alone.348 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 10, par. 1.

{Rom 3:29-30; Rom 11:36; 1 Cor 12:8; Jn 1:3-4; 1 Cor 11:12}
2. There remains a difference of one word, by which the Apostle seems to make a differentiation of meaning, which we should not casually pass over. He says that God justifies the circumcision from faith and not through faith; but the uncircumcision through faith and not from faith. That alteration of prepositions, it seems to me, was not uttered by him purposelessly. For we find in other passages of [Paul] that [prepositions] are not used arbitrarily but in a carefully considered fashion, and the necessary difference of this distinction is preserved. For instance, when speaking of God he says, "Because all things are from him and through him and in him."349 And again in another passage he says, "For as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman, but all things are from God."350 What he writes to the Corinthians is similar, "Now to one a word of wisdom is given through the Spirit, to another a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith in the same Spirit."351 But Paul is not the only apostle who maintains distinctions in the use of prepositions, but John does this as well. When, for example, he says of the Word of God that "all things were made through him,"352 he testifies that life was not made through him but in him. For he says, "What was made is life in him."353 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 10, par. 2.

{Rom 3:29-30; Rom 11:36}
3. Now since it would be too much to explain all the passages we have just now produced as examples, let us briefly summarize the sense of them as well as we can. When "from him" is said, something originative seems to be indicated under the token of this preposition. But when "through him" is said, the intelligence of a secondary cause, that is to say, one which is after the principal cause, is designated.354 For instance we might cite what [Paul] says, "All things are from him and through him and in him."355 "From him" means the initial creation of all things and that the things which exist received their beginning "from God." "Through him" signifies that the things which were previously made are being ruled and superintended "through" him from whom they derive the beginning of their existence. "In him" means that those who have now been reformed and corrected stand firm "in" his perfection. So then just as these things contain differences of the most pregnant meaning, these things are taught: We are said to possess "from God" the fact that we exist; that we are being superintended and ruled is designated to come to pass "through him"; and that we stand firm in the summit of perfection is said to take place "in him."356 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 10, par. 3.


{Rom 3:29-30; 1 Cor 11:12 }
4. Moreover it is possible to observe such a distinction in the present passage as well. It is noted that the circumcision who are justified, as it were, in the first place and first in order, need to be justified from faith and not through faith. The uncircumcision, however, because they are drawn to justification in the second place, are said to need to be justified not from faith but through faith. I think that in this verse that differentiation we mentioned above, "For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man comes through the woman,"357 is being designated in a stronger degree. For in the first place it is the man from whom the woman descends, not through the man.358 In the second place, however, the man comes through the woman, because the woman seems to serve in some manner as a helper to the man, her source. This is why the man is said to be born through the woman and not from the woman. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 10, par. 4.

{Gal 4:4; 1 Cor 11:8}
5. But perhaps someone may respond to our interpretation about the woman and the man and object that the Apostle has said about Christ, "He was made from a woman, made under the Law,"359 and he did not say, "made through a woman." The following, I think, should be said in response to this. Of every human being it will indeed be fitting to say that he has been made through a woman, since indeed he received his origin from a man before he was born through a woman. Christ, however, who has not assumed the origin of his flesh from a man's seed, is rightly said to have been made "from a woman."360 For to her, i.e., to the woman, the principal origin of his flesh is itself ascribed; and so the Apostle rightly records that he was made not through a woman but "from a woman."361 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 10, par. 5.

{Rom 3:29-30}
5. (cont.) One and the same God therefore will justify the circumcision from faith and the uncircumcision through faith. Now suppose someone with even more curiosity asks: Through whom are those who are justified from faith justified? and again: From whom are those who are justified through faith justified? Although it is possible to see excessive curiosity in this, nevertheless we can respond appropriately: Those who are justified from faith, since the beginning was received from faith, need to be perfected through the fulfillment of good works; and those who are justified through faith, having begun with good works, receive the summit of perfection through faith. Thus both elements, being rooted in each other, need to be brought to perfection. It is for this very reason, I believe, that the Apostle has set down immediately in what follows: 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 10, par. 5.

{Rom 3:31; Rom 3:20; Jn 5:46}
1. Do we then make void the Law through faith? By no means! Instead we establish the Law.362 Because in what was recorded above it seemed that everything referred entirely to faith, he alleges against himself the case which could be put forward by another and says: If a man is justified through faith and not from works of the Law, and if God justifies the circumcision from faith and the uncircumcision through faith, are you then, O Paul, setting aside the Law of Moses through faith? Yet he responds to himself against this objection and says, "By no means! On the contrary we establish the Law," that is to say, we confirm it. Now it is worth the trouble to see in what sense [Paul] is declaring that the Law is confirmed. Prior to this he had said that a man is not justified by works of the Law.363 In the Gospels the Savior says, "Moses wrote about me."364 Whoever then does not believe in Christ, of whom Moses wrote in the Law, sets aside the Law but he who believes in the Christ, of whom Moses writes, confirms the Law through the faith by which he believes in Christ.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 11, par. 1.

{Marcion; Ebionites; Rom 3:31}
2. For Marcion, who claims that there is one God of the Law and another who is the Father of Christ, neither establishes nor confirms the Law through his own faith,365 but he sets it aside. Ebion does this too.366 In fact all who introduce any corruption into the catholic faith do this. I might appropriately add that everyone who, while believing in Christ, behaves well and keeps himself from every stain of sin confirms the Law of God by living uprightly. However, the one who plunges headfirst into sinful vices and without any restraining halter of repentance is stained by the constant repetition of evil deeds, this man, even if he may seem to believe in Christ, does not establish the Law through his own faith but instead sets aside the Law. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 11, par. 2.

{Mt 5:17; 2 Cor 3:10-11}
3.  "For if what is set aside came through glory, the permanent in glory is much more." [2 Cor. 3:11]   4. For even if the Law is set aside through the glory which surpasses it,369 it is not set aside through Paul or through any other saint. This is also why the Lord was saying, "I have not come to destroy the Law but to fulfill it."370 No saint then, not even the Lord himself, sets aside the Law. But its temporal and transient glory is set aside and surpassed by the eternal and abiding glory. Consider then how carefully and with what sharp-sightedness the apostolic writings need to be read! He has not said, "For what was made glorious has not been glorified," and then reverted to silence-otherwise it would have been deemed a false statement. For how could that which is glorious not be glorified? But he has said additionally, "on account of the glory which surpasses it."371 [2 Cor 3:10] He wanted to show that the glory of Moses, that is to say, the glory of the Law, is not set aside by some individual. But, as we have said, in comparison with the greater glory which is in Christ, the glory which is in the Law is covered over and obscured. This is why he says, "For if what is set aside came through glory, the permanent in glory is much more."372 [2 Cor 3:11] That which is Christ's is permanent, he says; that which is of Moses is set aside; but set aside not through a human being but in comparison with the surpassing glory, as we have said.

4. (cont.) Since indeed "the Law was our pedagogue unto Christ"373 until the fullness of times should come.374 Just as we say that the task of a pedagogue is necessary only as long as the one who is under the pedagogue is little,375 and the duty of the pedagogue is set aside and becomes unnecessary when the one who was under the pedagogue reaches maturity. Thus in the same way we shall say that the task of the Law is set aside now that the fullness of time has arrived.376 And the son, who at one time differed in no respect from a slave,377 has become an heir of the father's property.

4. (cont.) But learn his custom with this word in other passages as well, that these things which the Apostle designates as things to be set aside should be understood in this way, where he says, "We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when the perfect comes, the things which were in part must be set aside."378 In that passage it is said that both Paul's knowledge and prophecy are set aside, yet no harm is done to his gift of apostolic grace. We should understand, of course, that in comparison with the perfect, that which is imperfect is superfluous and insignificant.

{Rom 3:31; 1 Cor 13:11; 2 Cor 3:7-16; Rom 3:21}
5. So then in the expression under discussion, Paul certainly does not set aside the Law but confirms it. But when the glory of Christ would be revealed, it silences and exposes and shows that the glory which appeared in Moses and by which he was glorified is not to be reckoned as glorious by the comparison in which [Christ's glory] surpasses it.379 This is precisely what is said elsewhere, . . . as Paul himself says, "But when I became a man I set aside the things of childhood."381 He shows this also by the comparison with the pedagogue, whose task is set aside and comes to an end when the child reaches the age of maturity.382 Therefore the Apostle has spoken with marvelous reserve, "Do we then set aside the Law through faith? By no means!" He did not say: Is the Law then set aside through faith, but, "do we then set aside the Law?" Then in what follows, "No, but we establish the Law." For even if the Law is set aside, it is set aside not through the faith but through the all-surpassing glory.383 Not only is the Law not set aside through the faith, it is established and confirmed through the apostles.384 For these very apostles are proclaiming that the Christ has now come, whom the Law and the Prophets predicted was going to come; and it is assuredly a confirmation of prophecy and of the Law when what was predicted is shown to be fulfilled. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 3, ch. 11, par. 5.


{Rom 3:21-31; Rom 4:1-2; Gen 15:6}
(2) Up above [Paul] had set forth two kinds of laws, one of which he called the law of works and the other the law of faith. He says that through the law of faith the boasting of those who boast in the works of the law is excluded; moreover he has declared that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law. Fittingly he now produces the example of Abraham in order that these matters may be affirmed from the Scriptures. He says, "If Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God." He certainly discusses this not without dialectical logic. For suppose anyone who is justified by works does not have anything to boast about before God. But it is certain that Abraham does have a ground for boasting before God. Therefore it follows that Abraham has been justified not by works but by faith since he necessarily has a ground for boasting before God. For this is what the Scripture declares, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."5 But if God reckoned it to him as righteousness, it can hardly be doubted that his faith is also his ground of boasting before God. This is also why the Apostle adds his own assertion to this testimony, which he had taken from the book of Genesis, and says, "Now to one who works, wages are not imputed as a gift but as something due; but to one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 2.
9. Hab 2.4 LXX; Rom 1.17; Heb 10.38. The LXX of Hab 2:4 differs from the MT by replacing the third person pronoun "his faith" by the first person "my faith." Paul retains neither pronoun in his citations of this passage. 

{Rom 4:1-2; Deut 29:29}
(3) Through this entire passage, then, the Apostle clearly makes known that there are two kinds of justification, one of which he designates as by works and the other by faith. He says that the one which is by works has a boast, but in itself and not before God. The one which is by faith, on the other hand, has a boast before God, as before the one who examines men's hearts and knows who believes in secret and who does not believe. Therefore it is deservedly said that such a person has a boast before God alone, who sees his disposition of faith which is in secret. However, it can come to pass for the person who hopes for the justification by works that his works may be approved by men as well. For whatever has been done by work and by hand is openly visible and can be seen with the eyes. And if faith is in secret yet works are openly visible, then it will be appropriate to include that which is written, "The secret things belong to the Lord your God, but what is manifested is for you and your sons."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 3.
 
{Rom 4:1-2; Deut 29:29; Heb 4:13}
(5) But since it is for God alone to know the secrets of the heart,12 he perceives clearly whether any disposition of faith dwells in an individual; and therefore the one who is justified by faith has a boast before God alone, who alone is the observer of the secrets of faith. Therefore, he says, even Abraham, if he was justified by works, indeed has a boast coming from the works, but not that [boast] which is before God alone. But it is certain that Abraham has a boast before God alone. The inference then is that he was justified not by works but by faith. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 5.

{1 Jn 3:9; 1 Jn 5:18; Rom 4:1-2}
(6) Now you should not imagine that if someone has such faith, by which, having been justified, he may have a boast before God, that he would be able at the same time to have unrighteousness with it as well. For there is no common ground between faith and infidelity; there is no communion of righteousness with wickedness, just as light can have no fellowship with darkness. For if "he who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God" and "he who has been born of God does not sin,"16 it is plain that he who believes in Jesus Christ does not sin; and that if he sins, it is certain that he does not believe in him. Therefore the proof of true faith is that sin is not being committed, just as, on the contrary, where sin is being committed, there you have proof of unbelief.17 For this reason then it is also said of Abraham in another passage of Scripture that he was justified by the works of faith.18 For it is certain that he who truly believes works the work of faith and righteousness and of complete goodness and becomes capable of both kinds of boasting: both that which is in secret before God as well as that which is openly visible and is not only before God.

(7) Having explained these things to the best of my powers, it would not seem right for me to pass over the observation that Paul has referred to Abraham as "our father according to the flesh." . . . For it is, of course, possible for the Apostle to call Abraham his father according to the flesh, seeing that Paul also descends from the Israelite race according to the flesh. Those who come from Ishmael and those who descend from Keturah's sons likewise can name Abraham their father according to the flesh. But the rest of the Gentiles will call him a father in the spirit and not in the flesh;

(8) In what follows is added, "Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness." This sentence is taken from the book of Genesis, from that passage where not Abraham but Abram says to the Lord, "Because you have given me no offspring, this slave born in my house is to be my heir. And the Lord said to him, 'He shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.' He brought him outside and said to him, 'Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.' And he said to him, 'So shall your descendants be.' And he believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 8.

{Rom 4:3; Gen 13:14-15; Gen 14:19-20} 
(9) We have extensively quoted these passages from the book of Genesis as an example, so that we might come to understand what was the cause of this justification. It must be very acutely examined to determine whether it is said that "his faith was reckoned as righteousness" merely on account of the fact that he believed that a son was going to be given him, and that from him offspring were going to be produced like the multitude of the stars; or was it on account of this and everything [else] which he had already believed beforehand? For it ought not be supposed that without faith he would have departed from his own homeland and from his own father's relatives and have gone to a land which God had showed him. Nor was faith absent when Lot separated from him and the Lord said to him, "Raise your eyes and look from this place where you are standing, and look to the north and south and to the west and to the east; for all this land that you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever." And who is going to say that when Abraham went and dwelled among the oaks of Mamre in Hebron and built there an altar to the Lord, it was done without faith? Furthermore, was it not also a work of faith when Melchizedek blessed Abraham and said, "Blessed be Abraham by God Most High, who created heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered his enemies into his hands"?

(10) From all these episodes it is inferred that Abraham possessed faith in each individual [instance] but only in part. However, in that story where it is said, "his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness," his faith should be declared perfect. For just as the Apostle says that knowledge and prophecy are in part, but, in contrast, says that they are perfect when he writes, "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when the perfect comes, the things which are in part will be set aside," in the same way we can understand that faith is sometimes in part and sometimes perfect.

{Lk 17:5; 1 Cor 13:2} 
(11) But in order that what we are saying might be fortified by still other testimonies of Holy Scripture, listen to the Apostles speaking to the Lord in the Gospel, "Lord, increase our faith!"30 Are they not plainly showing by this that they indeed have faith but the kind which was in need of increase? Moreover the Apostle Paul himself, when he says, "If I have all faith so as to remove mountains,"31 when he says "all" he is teaching that the whole is the composite of the parts. For "all" cannot be predicated where there is no diversity in quantity and quality.32 It would seem, then, even in the present passage that, even though Abraham is great, faith preceded through individual instances, some of which we have recorded above. Now in this occurrence his entire faith was gathered together and was thus reckoned to him as righteousness. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 11.

{Ex 14:31; Rom 4:3; Gen 15:6}
(12) Would faith be reckoned to every believer as righteousness? When I have recourse to the Scriptures, I do not find that faith is reckoned to every believer as righteousness. After all, it is written of the sons of Israel, "They believed in God and in his servant Moses";35 however it is not added that it was reckoned to them as righteousness, as was written about Abraham. This leads me to believe that in their case they did not possess the perfection of faith, collected together from many parts into one whole, which deserved to be reckoned as righteousness, as we taught to be the case for Abraham.

{Rom 4:4-5}
(13) What he says, "Now to the one who works, wages are not imputed as a gift but as something due. But to one who believes in him who justifies the ungodly, faith is reckoned as righteousness," seems as if to declare that in faith there is the gift of the one who justifies; in works, however, there is the righteousness of the one who repays. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 13.

{Rom 4:4-5}
 (14) But when I consider the majesty of this passage in which he says that to the one who works it is repaid as something due, I can hardly convince myself that there could be any work which would demand from God repayment as something due. For even the fact that we are able to do anything at all, to think and to speak, we do through his gift and generosity.36 What debt will he have to pay back to us, seeing that his capital came first? Therefore, we must consider whether perhaps the words, "Now to one who works, wages shall be imputed as something due," should instead be understood of the debt which is due for evil works.
 Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 14.

{Mt 6:12; Lk 7:37-38; Gen 4:2; Mt 7:23; Lk 13:27; Rom 6:23}
(15) For you will find frequently in the divine books that sins are called debts, just as the Lord himself taught us to say in prayer, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors";37 and again when the Lord says, "There were two debtors to a certain householder, one had a debt of five hundred denarii and the other fifty."38 And he himself interpreted this to refer to sins.39 Perhaps then in this passage as well the Apostle has treated the wages of a work which is repaid as a debt in this same sense which we have just described above concerning those who work in the same manner as Cain, who worked the ground,40 and just as it says in another passage, "Depart from me, workers of iniquity!"41 Surely the due punishment for the wages of iniquity is paid out to them. This is also why the same Apostle says in another passage, "The wages of sin is death."42 And he did not go on to say in similar fashion: but the wages of righteousness is eternal life. Instead he says, "But the gift of God is eternal life,"43 in order [not only] to teach that the wages, which are assuredly comparable with a debt and a reward, are a repayment of punishment and death, but to establish eternal life in grace alone. According to this sense, I think we ought to interpret as referring to evil works that which is written in the Gospel, "With the same measure you use, it will be measured out to you."44 For upon his own grace God has not placed measures, since it is written, "For God does not give the Spirit according to measure."45

{Rom 4:5}
(16) If these things are reckoned to have been discussed correctly, it seems that the matters closely linked must indeed be understood such that to the one who does evil works, rewards are paid back according to the debt of sin; but to the one "who believes in him who justifies the ungodly, faith is reckoned as righteousness"-if we remembered well what was said above when we showed that faith cannot be reckoned as righteousness to one who believes in part, but only to him who believes completely and perfectly. This kind of faith would justify even one who had been ungodly, so that he would no longer be ungodly, [not] as was that thief who was hanging on the cross blaspheming, but he should be like the one who was confessing and was saying, "Lord Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 16.

{Rom 4:5-8}
(17) After these words, as if confirming his previous statement, "But to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, faith is reckoned as righteousness," he adopts the testimony of the Psalms and says, "So also David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 'Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not impute sin.'" For he sees that in these words it can be consequently proved that righteousness is reckoned to a person apart from works. This is why it seems to me that the Apostle understood that either righteousness or unrighteousness must dwell in a person who has cognizance, through being old enough to distinguish good and evil. If this is so, no soul can be found without one of the two dwelling in it; and it is certain that if that [soul] should desist from evil, it would then be found in the good. But that soul is not in evil "whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered and against whom the Lord will not impute sin." It is therefore logical that it is in the good.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 17.

 {Rom 4:5-8}
(18) So then in connection with the forgiveness of iniquities and the covering of sins and [the fact] that the Lord does not impute sins, the Apostle fittingly says that only on the basis that he believes in him who justifies the ungodly, righteousness would be reckoned to a man, even if he has not yet produced works of righteousness. For faith which believes in the one who justifies is the beginning of being justified by God. And this faith, when it has been justified, is firmly embedded in the soil of the soul like a root that has received rain, so that when it begins to be cultivated by God's law, branches arise from it, which bring forth the fruit of works. The root of righteousness, therefore, does not grow out of the works, but rather the fruit of works grows out of the root of righteousness, that root, of course, of righteousness which God also credits even apart from works.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 18.

 {Rom 4:7-8}
(20) The distinction of the order of these [phrases] is striking to us. He has said firstly, "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven"; secondly, "whose sins are covered"; and thirdly, "to whom the Lord will not impute sin." Consider whether perhaps it is possible for this order to be recognized in one and the same soul. Thus, because the starting point of a soul's conversion is to abandon evil, on account of its doing so it would merit the forgiveness of iniquities. But when it begins to do good, as if covering over each of the evils it had previously committed with later good actions and introducing a quantity of goods more numerous than the evils which had existed, it may be said to cover its sins. But when a [soul] would forthwith reach perfection so that every root of evil is completely cut off from it to the point that no trace of evil can be found in it, at that point the summit of blessedness is promised to the one to whom the Lord would be able to impute no sin. There is clearly a difference between iniquity and sin. "Iniquity" is used of those matters which are committed against the law. This explains why the Greek language calls iniquity anomia, that is, "what is committed contrary to law." On the other hand, a matter can be called "sin" if it is wrongfully committed, contrary to what nature teaches or what the conscience convicts us of. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 1, par. 20.

{Rom 4:10-12}
(2) Paul now presents a question so that, through its response and the sequence of events itself, it might be taught that the blessedness of Abraham's justification was not granted after he had been circumcised but while he was still uncircumcised. But if Abraham was justified by faith while he was still uncircumcised, then everyone else who believes God, even if one is uncircumcised, can be justified through faith; and that blessedness can apply to him as well, which says, "Blessed is the one to whom the Lord will not impute sin." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 2.

{Rom 4:10-12}
(3) And he says, "How then was his faith reckoned to him as righteousness? Was it while he was circumcised or when he was uncircumcised?" For if it had happened at the time when he was already circumcised, it would certainly seem that the uncircumcised are excluded from the grace of his faith. But now he shows that faith was reckoned as righteousness while he was still uncircumcised, and on this account he declares that, since Abraham was justified through faith while he was uncircumcised, doubtless he will deservedly be called the leader and father of all who believe through uncircumcision. Yet because [Abraham] received circumcision after he had faith, a faith which occurred during his uncircumcision, [Paul] consequently sets forth the reason circumcision would have been given to him: It was to be a sign of his faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that through this he might become the father even of those who are born into circumcision, but only if they should attain to that faith which justified Abraham while he was uncircumcised. He becomes therefore a father of both peoples. Through faith he is a father of those who are uncircumcised; through the flesh, of those who are circumcised.

(4) For in my opinion the uncircumcised are those stones from which God is said to be able to raise up sons of Abraham. In them as well that which is written is fulfilled, "In you shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 4.

{Rom 3:11; Mt 12:39-40; Lk 2:34}
 (5) But let us repeat again what he says, "And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith which he had while he was still uncircumcised," and let us contemplate Paul's profound wisdom in these words. For perhaps to some he appears to be saying the same word twice, namely "sign" and "seal." But to me there appears to be a great difference in meaning between these words. For something is called a sign when, through that which appears, something else is indicated. For example the Lord says in the Gospel, "This generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so also for three days and three nights the Son of Man must be in the heart of the earth." This, then, is the sign: where Jonah was seen, Christ was recognized. Similarly it is said about the Lord himself in the Gospel, "Behold, he is destined for the falling and the rising of many, and to be a sign that will be spoken against." For the sign under which Christ had come was spoken against because one thing was seen in him, and something else was recognized. Flesh was perceived, and God was believed. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 5.

{Rom 4:10-12}
(6) In this way then Abraham too received a sign. And that it was a sign, it says in what follows, "circumcision," a circumcision which was the "seal of the faith which he had" before he was circumcised. [Paul] has done well, then, in calling circumcision a sign for Abraham, because one thing was seen in it and another thing was recognized. And he shows that even then that fleshly circumcision was a sign of spiritual circumcision which is received not in the flesh but in the heart.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 6.

{Rom 4:10-12; Rom 11:25-26}
(7) But in my opinion what he has called a seal ought to be understood in the following way: Something is called a seal when a protective guard is placed upon some object which is to be protected for a time and which no one else is allowed to unseal except the one who impressed it. As the Apostle explains, therefore, through that seal is indicated both the righteousness of faith which Abraham deserved to receive when he was uncircumcised, and also his being the father of many nations. We believe that it is to be unsealed only at the time when "the fullness of the Gentiles comes in" and "all Israel will be saved." For at that time what the Apostle says will come to pass, for Abraham to be the father not only of the Gentiles but also of the circumcision through faith. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 7.

{Rom 4:10-12; Rom 11:25-26; Jn 8:39}
(8) Let us discuss this matter about the sign and the seal even more explicitly. A sign, as we have said, is where something is indicated through that which is seen. A seal, on the other hand, is where something which is closed up for a time and is not open to view. In this way it is possible to understand that the mysteries which were foreshadowed in the Law and in the patriarchs were of such a kind that they were to be both indicated in signs and guarded with seals. Because what was to be indicated by signs was in those who were Gentile believers, it is said that Abraham had received a sign. Yet he is said to have received a seal because these things were to be guarded and covered for those who were of the circumcision who were not going to believe. The seal will undoubtedly be designated at that time when, in the last days after "the fullness of the Gentiles comes in," as we have said, "all Israel will be saved." . . . For it is not those who are born from Abraham according to the flesh who should be called Abraham's sons, unless they also possess the faith and works of Abraham. After all, it was for this reason as well that the Lord says, in the Gospel, to the Jews who were boasting to be sons of Abraham, "If you were Abraham's sons, you would do the works of Abraham."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 8.
 
{Dan 13:56 [LXX]; Ezek 16:3}
(9) But do you also want to be instructed from the Old Testament that one is called a son but not of the one from whose fleshly seed he descends, but of the one whose deeds and works he imitates? Listen to what Daniel says to one of the elders whom he convicts of adultery, "[You are] an offspring of Canaan and not of Judah; beauty has seduced you and lust has turned your heart away." [Dan 13:56 LXX] You see that the one who had descended in a fleshly manner from the race of Judah is denied to be Judah's son, but is obviously a son of Canaan, whose deeds and works he was following. So also in this way those who derive their race from the seed of Abraham according to the flesh are not called Abraham's sons if they do not possess his faith. After all, the prophet also speaks in this way to them, "Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite." [Ezek 16:3] Assuredly not the bond of race but the imitation of their moral behavior united [the Israelites] to these nations.

{Rom 4:11-12}
(10) "So that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised that it might be reckoned to them as righteousness, and the father of the circumcised who are not only of the circumcision, but who also are of those who follow the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised." Here he plainly declares, as we said above, that what is demanded from members of both peoples is not the lineage of the flesh but the noble quality of faith. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 2, par. 10.

{Rom 4:3; Rom 4:10-11}
(11) Not even this ought to escape the notice of the attentive reader who does not pass over a single jot or tittle of the Law,79 that the Apostle said, "His faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness." However at the time when it was written of him that he believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness he was not yet called Abraham, but his name was Abram.80 For, as the Apostle explains, up to this point he was still uncircumcised. . . . The Apostle has named him [Abraham] here, not as it was written in the passage in Genesis, but as God had declared concerning him. For it is appropriate at a later time to note that which is divinely ordained.

(1) For the promise to Abraham and his descendants that they would be heirs of the world did not come through the Law but through the righteousness of faith.82 In this passage it seems to me that the Apostle is contending about the Law of Moses and affirming that the promise which was made to Abraham, that he himself or his descendants would receive the world, i.e., the entire earth, as an inheritance, was not established from the Law of Moses. For before Moses even existed as a legislator, it says, "The Lord appeared to Abraham and said to him, 'Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, and you will be blessed. And I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse; and in you all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.'"83 Therefore, what it says, "in you all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed," is that he becomes an heir of the entire world. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 3, par. 1.

{Gen 12:1-3; Rom 4:3; Gen 15:6}
(1 cont) So then the promise to Abraham and his descendants that he would be heir of the world is not from the Law but through the righteousness of faith. What is the righteousness of faith? It is written about above, as we have now frequently said,84 "Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness."85 This is not undeserved; for whereas the observance of the law merely evades punishment, the merit of faith awaits the hope of the promise. Precept is laid on slaves, but faith is sought by friends.86 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 3, par. 1.

{Rom 4:14-15}
For if it is those who are of the Law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. For the law works wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression. . . . If those who are of the law will be heirs of that promise which Abraham merited through faith, then the fact that Abraham was justified by faith will be rendered null and void, since assuredly, if the future inheritance were from the Law, Abraham would also have been required first to fulfill the Law and in this way to merit the inheritance of righteousness. And in order to show that this in no way could be the case, he says that "the law works wrath." Where there is wrath, there is no inheritance."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4.

{Rom 4:14-15}
(3) But now in this place where it says, "For the law works wrath," it should be carefully examined as to which law this discourse seems to concern. The same for that which follows, "For where there is no law, neither is there transgression." . . . If one becomes a transgressor who turns away from the law, doubtless also he is a transgressor who turns away from faith. And if the law is to blame for that transgression [committed] under the law, then faith should also be believed to be to blame for a transgression [committed] under faith. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 3.

{Marcion; Rom 4:14-15; 1 Tim 2:14}
(4) Moreover, we will add this: What will they [the Marcionites] say to us about those who became transgressors before the Law of Moses? For if no transgressor existed before Moses, then no one was condemned and no one was punished. What will they say of the residents of Sodom? What about those who were condemned in the flood? What about Cain? What of Adam himself ? And what will they answer concerning Eve, of whom the Apostle says, "The woman was seduced and became a transgressor"?98 If there is no transgression without the Law of Moses, why are Adam and Eve called transgressors by the Apostle?99 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 4.

{Law, Mosaic}
 (5) But in fact, as we have already frequently said above,100 the Apostle introduces different laws in this epistle. One moment he is discoursing about the Law of Moses, the next moment he mentions the law of faith.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 5.

102. Rom 7.22-23. 
103. Rom 7.23. 
104. Lv 20.2, 27; Dt 13.11; 17.5; Lv 20.14; 21.9. 
105. For "wrath" as punishment cf. 1.16.1; 4.11.6. 

{Rom 7:23}
(6) One must consider, then, whether perhaps the law which is in our members and leads us captive to the law of sin is not the same law which the Apostle says works wrath. For there can be no doubt that it works wrath on one whom it had led captive to the law of sin.103 However where that law does not exist, it is certain that there will be no transgression [of it]. In fact, those who are under that law will not be heirs. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 6.

{Lev 20:2; Lev 20:27; Deut 13:11; Deut 17:5; Lev 20:14; Lev 21:9}
(7) But if someone wants to mention the Law of Moses and say that it works wrath, he could assert this on this one, perhaps only, point, that it orders the one who sins against it to be stoned immediately or be destroyed with fire104 or whatever other punishment is decreed in the law against sinners. Thus the penalty itself which is inflicted against the sinner from the law may now appear to be called by the Apostle "wrath." And similarly regarding transgression in this passage he does not generally include everything termed "transgression," but only those of the one who sinned while under the law. Thus the offence of one who sinned, though forbidden by law, would seem more serious than of one who was not warned by any law.106
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 7.

{Rom 4:14-15; 1 Tim 1:9} 
(8) He shows by this that indeed there could be no transgression at all unless law existed; yet it is not the case that if there is law, in every case there will also be transgression. . . .It is, however, not possible for there to be transgression where there is no law. For even if we should consider the Law of Moses, not necessarily everyone who lived under the Law of Moses became transgressors. Otherwise we seem to implicate the prophets together 
with all the righteous; unless perhaps anyone should say that all the righteous and all the prophets had lived not so much under the Law as under faith, whereas the sinners and the unrighteous were bound with the fetters of the Law, as the Apostle also says, "The law is laid down not for the righteous but for the unrighteous and disobedient."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 8.


{Rom 2:14-15}
(9) But if the Law was laid down for such people, will not those [other] persons seem to you to be much better off, of whom it is said, "For when Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do naturally the things of the Law, these, though not having this law, are a law to themselves. They show that the work of the Law is written on their hearts, as their conscience also bears witness to them"? If it is fitting, let us set before our eyes two men, for example, who have not lain with men as with women. One of them, prohibited by a precept of the Law probably would have committed the act had his fear not held him. The other, by a judgment of his own mind, refused even to permit his thoughts to consent to this sort of defiling activity. Do you not much more prefer that man who, although not deterred by the threat of a law, kept himself unstained from contamination of this kind of disgraceful conduct?
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 9.

{Law, Mosaic; Rom 7:23; Rom 4:3}
(10) Therefore, whether the Law of Moses or even the "law in our members" is understood and works wrath, those who are of this law cannot be heirs, but [only] those who are of the law of faith, that faith by which Abraham was justified. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 10.

{Jn 5:46}
(11) In that passage in which he says, "If you believed Moses, you would assuredly believe also in me," he exposes the unbelief of those who, as long as they do not believe in [Christ], show that they do not even believe the writings of Moses in which is contained, through prophetic discourse, that concerning the coming of Christ. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 4, par. 11.

{Rom 4:16-17}
(1) For this reason it is by faith, in order that the promise according to grace may be firm to all his descendants, not only to him who is of the law but also to him who is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all of us, as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations"-in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as things that are. Up above he made a distinction between wages and grace, saying that wages are a matter of debt whereas grace is a favor, not for a debt but for kindness.124 In the present passage as well, then, since he wants to show that God gives the inheritance of the promises not as something due but through grace, he says that the inheritance from God is granted to those who believe, not as the debt of a wage but as a gift of faith. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 1.

{Rom 4:16-17}
(2) For, to give an example, just as I might say that we exist, this cannot be understood to mean that we exist as a wage for our works. Plainly it is a gift of God that we exist; it is the grace of the Creator who willed us to exist.125 In this way as well, if we receive the inheritance of God's promises, it is the wage of divine grace and not of any debt or work. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 2.

{Rom 4:16-17; 1 Cor 12:9; Phil 1:29; Lk 17:5}
(3) Now it may perhaps appear that what is said to be "of faith" is not by grace since, if a person must first offer his faith, grace thus has to be merited from God. But listen to what the same Apostle teaches elsewhere about this as well. For in the passage where he lists the gifts of the Spirit,126 which he says are given to believers according to the measure of their faith,127 he asserts that the gift of faith as well is granted along with the other gifts through the Holy Spirit. For after many words he speaks of it in this way, [M975] "To another faith is given by the same Spirit,"128 in order to show that even faith is given through grace.129 Moreover elsewhere the same Apostle teaches this when he says, "Because it has been granted to you from God not only that you believe in Christ but also that you should suffer on his behalf."130 You find this also pointed out in the Gospels, where the Apostles, once understanding that faith, which is only human, cannot be perfected unless that which comes from God should be added to it, say to the Savior, "Increase our faith!"131 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 3.

{Rom 4:16-17; Gen 6:8; Gen 18:3; Ex 33:13}
 (4) From all of which it is most clearly proven what the Apostle says here, "For this reason it is by faith, in order that the promise according to grace may be firm," because even the very faith by which we seem to believe in God is confirmed in us as a gift of grace. This is the grace which, like a great treasure, one deserves to find if one is blessed.132 Noah found it, and for that reason it is written of him, "But Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord God."133 Moses had also found this grace; for this reason he was saying to God, "If I have found grace in your sight."134 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 4.

{Rom 4:16-17}
 (6) It is faith of this sort, then, which is reckoned as the righteousness which is receptive of heavenly grace.141 This comes to pass for Abraham's offspring, not merely for the one who is of the Law, but also for the one who is of faith. For the succession from Abraham which is by faith is much more noble than that of the flesh, seeing that it is recorded that he was justified by faith and not by the flesh. For if succession is to be granted not by faith but by descent [from Abraham], it would then be logical that Ishmael's posterity and those who descended from Keturah would be led into the mysteries of the promises. But this is assuredly not admitted. On the contrary, only the posterity who are of law and faith are introduced.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 6.

{Rom 4:16; Mt 3:9; Lk 3:8} 
(9) Now it is well that he did not say of Abraham, "the father of all," but instead he says, "the father of us all." . . . How then can the circumcision group defend the claim that Abraham is their own father when God himself, who also gave circumcision, appointed him to be the father of many nations? . . . This is also what the Lord156 was saying in the Gospel, "For God is able to raise up sons of Abraham from these stones."157 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 9.

{Rom 4:17; Ezek 18:4; Ezek 18:20; 1 Jn 1:1; Eph 2:5; Eph 2:1}
(10) Yet he has added in what follows, "who gives life to the dead and calls the things that are not as things that are."158 We understand "dead" here with respect to the sin of the soul, since it says, "the soul which sins shall die."159 For just as the senses perish at bodily death and the body no longer takes in either the sense of sight, hearing, smell, taste, or touch, so also is it that anyone who has ruined the spiritual senses160 in the soul neither sees God nor hears the words [M978] of God. . . Men of this sort are deservedly called "dead." The coming of Christ found us in this condition, but he gave us life by his grace, as the same Apostle also says elsewhere, "And when we were dead in our transgressions and sins, he raised us up together with him."164 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 10.

{Rom 4:17; Ex 3:14}
(12) "And he calls the things that are not as things that are." Elsewhere we have repeatedly explained that God alone says, "I am who I am." God's essence is one and exists always. If someone should join himself to it, he becomes one spirit with it, and through him who always is, even he himself will be said to be. However the one who is far from him and assumes no participation in him is not even said to be, just as we Gentiles were before we came to the knowledge of the divine truth.172 . . . But if the Gentiles, by believing, come to the faith of Abraham, the Apostle has suitably declared that God has called "the things that are not as things that are." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 12.

{Rom 4:17}
(14) He also speaks in this passage of the things which are not, in order to set aside the things which are, and he indicates that the Gentiles are those who are not, and the Jews are those who are. That is to say, the [Jews] who were under the law but were not fulfilling the Law were to be set aside. And those who were not under the Law were to be brought in and joined by merit of their believing in Abraham's faith. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 5, par. 14.

{Rom 4:18-19; Gen 15:2-3}
(2) It seems to me that what the Apostle said, "against hope," refers to what Abraham is recorded in Genesis as having said to the Lord, "'O Lord and Ruler, what will you give me? But I am being dismissed without sons; here is the son of Masech my slave woman, Eliezer of Damascus.' And Abraham said, 'Because you have given me no offspring, this slave born in my house is to be my heir.'"180 From these words it is, of course, understood that Abraham had given up hope that he would conceive sons. But in my opinion that it said, "he believed in hope," refers to the hope, given to him again. . . . From these words, then, both the initial hopelessness and the subsequent hope given to him by the promises of God are made known. Because he believed in him, what the Apostle now sets forth is written about him, "It was reckoned to him as righteousness."182 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 6, par. 2.

{Rom 4:18-19; Heb 11:1; 1 Cor 13:13}
(3) Fittingly and in accordance with his normal practice, the Apostle, when treating the subject of faith, joins hope to it, because he knows that hope cleaves inseparably to faith, just as he teaches the same in the letter to the Hebrews183 when he says, "But faith is the substance of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen."184 . . . I consider faith to be the first beginnings and the very foundations of salvation; hope is certainly the progress and increase of the building; however love is the perfection and culmination of the entire work. That is why love is said to be greater than everything else.190 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 6, par. 3.

{Rom 4:18-19}
(4) Thus Abraham "against hope believed in hope that he would become the father of many nations," which in the future would be like the stars of heaven, not only in terms of the greatness of number but also in splendor. He believed firmly in the one who gave the promise and "did not weaken in faith."
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 6, par. 4.

{Rom 4:19; Gen 25:2; 1 Cor 7:9; Gen 18:11}
(7) However someone may object to us: How can it be said that Abraham had a dead body at the age of one hundred years? For after he gave birth to Isaac and after Sarah had died, who had conceived [Isaac] at the age of ninety and lived to be one hundred twenty-seven years old, and even after Isaac took Rebecca for a wife when he was forty, after all this it is 
written, "Going further, Abraham took a wife, whose name was Keturah. She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Median, Ishbak, and Shuah."205 How could his body be dead, seeing that he grew much older than he was at that time and was able to take a wife and beget six more children?206 . . . In [Abraham] as well, then, there was this mortification of the members. He was not enticed by luxury; he did not burn with lust like those of whom Paul says, "It is better to marry than to burn."211 This same good was also in Sarah; and therefore it is written about her, "womanish things had ceased to function in Sarah."212 For in her there was none of that feminine lasciviousness or the dissoluteness of incontinence, nor were either of them carried off unwillingly into the enjoyment of lustful desires. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 6, par. 7.

{Mt 12:50; 1 Tim 2:15}
(9) And just as the Lord himself says concerning himself, "Whoever should do the will of my father in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother."225 Who then shall be a mother of Jesus if not the one whose womb is dead in this way, so that only then she might afterward bring forth sons of chastity, like the woman about whom the Apostle says, "Yet she will be saved through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and chastity"?226 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 6, par. 9.

{Rom 4:23-25}
(1) But it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned to him as righteousness, but for ours also, to whom it will be reckoned, to us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was handed over on account of our trespasses and was raised on account of our justification.227 In this passage what he says, "for his sake alone" ought to be understood as referring to him. Likewise what he says, "but for ours also," refers to us. For obviously Moses did not write these words, "Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,"228 so that Abraham might read them, seeing that Abraham had died long before, but in order that we might make progress in the faith by this kind of reading, understanding that if we believe God in the manner that [Abraham] believed, faith will also be reckoned to us as righteousness, "to those who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 7, par. 1.

{Rom 4:23-25}
(2) By all means, in this passage I would like to examine why it is that when the Apostle designates the God in whom we believe and in whom Abraham believed, he has not said: to those who believe in God, the Most High, or: to those who believe in him who made heaven and earth, or: in him who made the angels and the other powers of heavenly glory. Instead he says, "who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead." Let us inquire, then, why, in comparison with Abraham's faith, that title concerning the Lord's resurrection is adopted.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 7, par. 2.

{Rom 4:23-25; Jn 8:56}
(3) Had Abraham actually believed in him who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead? After all, Jesus had at that time not yet been raised from the dead. . . . This great and marvelous mystery was anticipated in Abraham's faith. For when he was commanded to sacrifice his only son,230 he believed that God was able to raise him even from the dead;231 he believed as well that this matter would not only be accomplished at that time for Isaac but that the full truth of the mystery would be reserved for his seed, who is Christ.232 This, after all, is the reason he offered his only son with joy, because he was contemplating in him, not the destruction of posterity but the restoration of the world and the renovation of the entire creation which has been reestablished through the resurrection of the Lord. This is why the Lord says of him, "Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad."233 Therefore in this way the comparison made between the faith of Abraham and of those who believe in him who raised the Lord Jesus seems to be well made; for what Abraham believed as a matter of the future is believed by us as accomplished.234 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 7, par. 3.

{Eph 2:6; Rom 6:4; Col 2:12; Heb 1:3; Eph 1:20; Rom 6:8-11; Col 3:1-2}
(5) Elsewhere the same Apostle says, "God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly places."238 He is therefore reminding us that if you believe that he has raised Christ from the dead,239 believe also that he has raised you yourselves likewise with him. And if you believe that he sat down at the right hand of the Father in heaven,240 believe as well that you yourselves have been placed together with him no longer in earthly regions but in heavenly.241 And if you believe that you have died together with Christ, believe also that you will live together with him. And if you believe that Christ has died to sin and lives to God, you also ought to be dead to sin and live to God.242 This is precisely what he declares with apostolic authority when he says, "But if you have been resurrected with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on the things that are above, not on things that are on earth."243

 (6) For it is not possible that righteousness can be reckoned to a person who has any unrighteousness dwelling in him, even if he believes in him who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead.244 For righteousness cannot have anything in common with unrighteousness; just as light cannot with darkness, nor life with death.245 So also then certainly to those who believe in Christ but do not lay aside the old man with his unrighteous deeds,246 faith cannot be reckoned as righteousness. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 7, par. 6.

{Rom 4:25}
(7) For it is on this account as well that he adds to this in what follows and goes on to say of the Lord Jesus, "who was handed over on account of our sins and was raised on account of our justification." He wanted to show that even we must abhor and reject the things on account of which Christ was handed over. For if we believe he was handed over on account of our sins, why do we not regard every sin as hostile and injurious to us, seeing that it is recorded to be on account of these sins that our redeemer was handed over to death? For if any fellowship or friendship should again occur between us and sin, we are showing that we have no regard for the death of Christ Jesus, since we are embracing and following the things which he fought against and conquered. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 7, par. 7.

{Rom 4:25; Eph 4:22-24; Col 3:9-10}
(7 con't) The Apostle, bringing all this together at once, has designated the garment of the old man as if a body of sin, which he urges those who believe in him who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead to strip off, in order that, by rejecting the garment of unrighteousness, they might put on the Lord Jesus,248 which is the true garment of righteousness, so that faith would be deservedly reckoned as righteousness to those who believe.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 4, ch. 7, par. 7.
 
{Rom 4:25; Eph 4:22-24; Col 3:9-10}
 (8) "Therefore he was handed over on account of our sins and resurrected on account of our justification." For if we have been raised together with Christ, who is righteousness, if we walk in the newness of life, if we live in accordance with righteousness, then to us Christ has been raised for our justification. But if we have not yet laid aside the old man with his deeds, but we live in unrighteousness, I dare say that to us Christ has not yet been resurrected for justification nor has he been handed over on account of our sins. For if I believe this, how can I love that for which he endured death? If I believe these things, that he rose for my justification, how can unrighteousness be pleasing to me? Therefore Christ justifies only those who have received the new life in the pattern of his resurrection and who reject the old garments of unrighteousness and iniquity as if they were the cause of death.

{Rom 5:1-2; Phil 4:7; Rom 5:10; Col 1:20; 2 Cor 5:20}
(1) Therefore, having been justified by faith, let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we also have an access through faith to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in the hope of the glory of God.262 But in order that we might ascertain the Apostle's meaning with greater care, let us examine what the word "peace" means in itself, as well as that "peace" which is through our Lord Jesus Christ. "Peace" is said where no one is in disagreement, no one quarrels, where nothing hostile and nothing barbaric is being done. So then, we who were once God's enemies by following that enemy and tyrant, the devil, now most assuredly have peace with God,264 if we have thrown down the devil's arms and have taken up the sign of Christ and the banner of his cross.265 But this takes place through our Lord Jesus Christ who reconciled us to God through the sacrifice of his own blood, as it is written, "When we were God's enemies we were reconciled through the blood of his cross."266 Elsewhere Paul has added to these things by saying, "We make our appeal on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God!"267 If then someone has peace with God and is reconciled through the blood of Christ, he no longer partakes of the things which are hateful to God.268 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 1.

{Rom 8:7}
(1. con't) Now do you want to hear what those things are which are hateful to God? Paul himself teaches you when he says, "The wisdom of the flesh is hateful to God, for it is not subjected to the law of God."269 And so, if you are wise in a fleshly manner, or if you expose your life to the lusts of the flesh and release the floods of luxury, or if you interpret the law with a fleshly understanding and not spiritually, . . . then you have become God's enemy through the wisdom of the flesh.270 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 1.

{Jas 4:4; 1 Jn 2:15-16; Eph 2:14-15}
2) Not only Paul writes such things in his letters. Listen also to James, the brother of the Lord, testifying in similar fashion when he says, "Whoever wants to be a friend of this world makes himself an enemy of God."271 Moreover John testifies to the same things, "Little children, do not love the world or the things in the world, because everything which is in the world, both the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes, are not from God."272 Therefore the person in whom these things exist cannot have peace with God. . . . This is precisely what the Apostle says elsewhere about Christ, "He himself is our peace, who made the two one by destroying the dividing wall of separation, the hostility. He nullified in his flesh the law of commands with its ordinances, that he might form the two into one new man in himself, making peace."273 But if Christ came to destroy the hostility and to make peace and to reconcile to God those of us who were divided by the barrier of evil which we had constructed by our practice of sin, then, after that barrier of sin has been removed, whoever is turned back again to sin, no doubt he restores the hostility and rebuilds the wall of separation and, by this means, destroys the work of Christ and makes void the cross of his suffering.

(3) Let us have peace so that the flesh will no longer struggle against the spirit274 nor the law of the members strive against the law of God.275 Among us may it not be "Yes and no,"276  [2 Cor 1:18] but may we all say one thing, may we think the same things, may there be no dissension within ourselves nor outside with one another.277 And then we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. One thing must be recognized with complete certainty: No one in whom an evil vice exists can have peace. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 3.

{Jas 4:7-8}
(4) Now if you should ask me: How can a righteous man have peace when he is being attacked by the devil and is enduring wars of temptations? I would say that this man has peace more than everyone else.278 We enter more into peace with God at that time when we are persevering in warlike hostility against the devil and when we struggle furiously against vices of the flesh. After all, in this manner the apostle James says, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you; come near to God and he will come near to you."279 Thus you can see that he thought that one will be near to God at that very moment when he is resisting the devil. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 4.

{Jn 10:9; Jn 14:6; 1 Cor 1:30; Mt 11:29}
(5) And he has added, "through whom we also have an access into this grace in which we stand." How we may have access to grace through our Lord Jesus Christ the Savior himself states, "I am the door, and no one comes to the Father except through me."280 We have access to grace through him, then, because he is the door. But let us see what sort of door he is in order that we might understand what sort of people they ought to be who would enter through it and have access to grace. The door is Truth,281 and through the door of truth liars cannot enter. Again, the door is also Righteousness,282 and through the door of righteousness the unrighteous do not pass. The door says, "Learn from me because I am gentle and humble in heart."283 Through the door of humility and gentleness, then, neither the wrathful nor the arrogant may enter. Consequently if there is someone who, in accordance with the Apostle's word, wants to have access through our Lord Jesus Christ to the grace of the Lord in which Paul and those who are like him claim to stand, he must be purged from all these things we have recorded above. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 5.

{Mt 25:8-9; 1 Cor 15:10}
(6) Doubtless this is what happened to those five foolish virgins who, since they did not bring the oil of good works in their vessels,284 found the door closed when they came too late.285 For these foolish souls were unable to enter through the door of wisdom and have access to grace. Rightly however does the Apostle Paul claim to stand in grace, who also has said elsewhere, "I have worked harder than all the others, but not I but the grace of God with me."286 Therefore if there be another who would work harder, . . . and amidst all these things should stand constant in faith, he will likewise be said to stand in grace.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 6.

{Rom 5:2}
(7) Let us further consider what it is that follows: "And we boast in the hope of the glory of God." What troubles me is why he did not claim to boast in the glory of God, but "in the hope of the glory of God." Indeed, something seems to be missing from this expression such that there ought to be supplied: the hope "of seeing" the glory of God. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 7.

{Rom 5:2; Heb 1:3; Mt 5:8}
(8) That glory which is hoped for, however, of which it says, "in the hope of the glory of God," is never set aside. For it is of such a quality that the same Apostle says of it while speaking of Christ, "He is the brightness of his glory and the exact imprint of his substance."292 Those who bear the hope of seeing this glory, then, are the ones of whom it has been said, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."293 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 8.

{Rom 5:2; Lk 9:26}
(9) In point of fact that glory which is to be hoped for, concerning which in the present passage the Apostle is claiming to boast, "in the hope of the glory of God," can be understood to refer to that glory of which the Savior speaks in the Gospel, "When the Son of Man comes in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."300 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 9.

{2 Cor 3:18; Eph 1:18}
(10) In a similar way as well, what the Apostle has said, "Beholding the Lord's glory with unveiled face we shall be transformed into the same image from glory unto glory as from the spirit of the Lord,"308 should be understood such that whoever contemplates that glory of the only-begotten with an unveiled face, i.e., with a complete understanding of the faith, will steer the acuteness of their mind, by the same image in which he goes from the Law to the Gospels and to the coming of the Savior in the flesh, when the gaze of the heart is enlightened by faith,309 to the [Lord's] second coming in glory. Such a person will be transformed from the present glory to that of the future glory which is hoped for. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 8, par. 10.

{Rom 5:3-5}
(1) And not only that, but we also boast in afflictions, knowing that affliction produces patience, and patience produces approved character, and approved character produces hope; and surely hope does not confound, because God's love has been shed abroad into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.311 The very first words in this section contain a certain ambiguity, for in what comes next there is nothing to which what he said, "not only that" might be referred.312  . . . In my opinion, "not only that" should be referred to all these things which have just been said. That is: We have through our Lord Jesus Christ not only these things which I have just said, but also the fact that we boast in our afflictions. For whereas others are saddened during affliction, we boast in afflictions, having been strengthened by the power of his grace. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 1.

{Rom 5:3; Jer 9:23-24}
(2) First let us look at what [Paul] has said about boasting: "We boast in our afflictions." Discussion about boasting in the Scriptures is sometimes stated in a praiseworthy manner, sometimes in a blameworthy manner. For example, when Jeremiah says, "Thus says the Lord: Let not the wise man boast in his own wisdom, nor the strong man boast in his strength, nor the wealthy boast in his wealth; but let him who boasts, boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices mercy, judgment, and righteousness upon the earth,"315 in one and the same passage he depicts boasting both in a praiseworthy and a blameworthy sense. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 2.

{Rom 5:3}
(3) What we are saying is this: Everything which exists or is done is either good or evil or indifferent. . . . It is certain that things are strictly called "good" which pertain to the virtues of the spirit; and only those things are to be defined as "evil" which tend to evilness and which are done contrary to God's law. Other things, however, are indifferent,316 that is to say, they are to be designated neither good nor evil, as are wealth, physical beauty, strength, height, and those things which serve the needs of the body. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 3.

{Rom 5:3-5; Jer 9:24; 1 Cor 1:31}
(4) Paul, however, who was extremely experienced in these matters, when he had said, "we boast in our afflictions," lest he be thought to be boasting [kauchaomai Strongs 2744] in things indifferent and neutral, immediately gives the grounds for this and declares that his own boasting in afflictions pertains to the virtues of his spirit. For he says the following: The "affliction," for the sake of which I boast, "produces patience, and patience produces approved character, and approved character hope; and hope does not confound, because the love of God has been shed abroad into our hearts through the Holy Spirit." By these statements he is teaching that boasting in one's afflictions may ascend, by means of the virtues which accompany them, up to the summit of the Holy Spirit, just as he says elsewhere, "Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord."317 It is not proper to boast, then, in one's own wisdom or strength or wealth, but in God alone. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 4.

{Ps 34:19; Ps 32:10; Lk 8:45}
(8) "Affliction" [thlipsis-Strong's #2347] in the strict sense applies to the saints, but the affliction of the godless and the unrighteous is called a "scourge." After all, in the Psalms it says this: "Many are the afflictions of the righteous."324 Of the others, however, it says, "Many are the scourges of the sinner."325 Perhaps for this reason as well affliction and distress326 pertain to saints because they are the ones who travel the "narrow and constricted road"327  [thlibo-Strong's #2347] and therefore they are said to suffer affliction.328 In my opinion the apostles also understood this in the Lord, who is the true road329 upon which the saints travel, when they said, "Master, the crowds are pressing about you and are constricting you."330 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 8.

{1 Cor 9:27}
(9) We ought to accept as the afflictions of the righteous, then, not only those which come externally . . . but also from the fact that while at rest they afflict and exhaust themselves331 by resisting their own desires, by harnessing their lust, by keeping unbounded liberty in check. . . . This is in accordance with the one who said, "I punish my body and subject it to servitude, so that after preaching to others I myself should not be rejected."332 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 9.

{2 Cor 4:8}
(10) Paul, when writing to the Corinthians, distinguishes these things, for so he says, "In every way we suffer affliction but we are not constrained"337 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 10.

{Rom 5:5; 1 Cor 13:13}
(12) But it seems that I must consider whether here that love which, he says, "is shed abroad into our hearts through the Holy Spirit," is that by which we love God or with which we are loved by God. Now if, indeed, that love by which we love God is to be understood here, the statement needs no confirmation. But if that love by which we are being loved by God is instead to be understood here, since he said, "the love of God is poured out into our hearts," it is certain that he is putting down love as the highest and greatest gift of the Holy Spirit.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 12.

{Trinity}
(12 con't)  Now if "the Spirit of love" and "the Son of love" and "the God of love" are found, it is certain that both the Son and the Holy Spirit are to be understood as springing from the one fountain of Paternal Deity. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 12.

{Rom 5:5; 2 Pet 1:4}
(12 con't)  From the fullness of the Spirit, the fullness of love is infused into the hearts of the saints in order to receive participation in the divine nature, as the apostle Peter has taught.348 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 9, par. 12.

{Rom 5:5-7}
(1) For Christ, while we were still weak, at the set time, died for the ungodly. For rarely will anyone die for the just-though perhaps for the good someone might dare to die.350 Wanting to demonstrate more fully the excellent qualities of the love which he had said was shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit,351 for reasons we should have understood, he explains, teaching us that Christ died not for the godly but for the ungodly. For we were ungodly before we were converted to God, and it was assuredly before we believed that Christ took upon himself his death for us. It is beyond doubt that he would not have done this unless he was filled with an overwhelming love for us beyond measure, both our Lord Jesus Christ himself, in his dying for the ungodly, and God the Father, in his handing over his only begotten for the redemption of the ungodly.352 For since it is rare that anyone would die for the just and each person hesitates to undergo death even if the death is a just cause, then how great is he and how enormous must we judge to be the love for us of him who, at the time when he suffered, did not run away from enduring death for the ungodly and the unjust? 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 10, par. 1.

{Mk 10:18}
(1 cont) This [love] is certainly a sign of Christ's supreme divine goodness. For unless he had come forth from that substance353 and had been the Son of that Father, of whom it was said, "No one is good except one, God the Father,"354 he would assuredly not have been able to show forth so much goodness to us.355   
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 10, par. 1.

{Rom 5:7}
(1 con't) Therefore "rarely will anyone die for the just." But for the good [i.e. Christ] someone might dare to die, and die boldly, especially when he has come to understand that while we were still ungodly and weak, at that time, he first died for us. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 10, par. 1.

{Rom 5:8-9}
(2) In my opinion, for Paul this variety of words is not superfluous, that sometimes he calls those for whom Christ died "the weak," sometimes "the ungodly," and sometimes "sinners." . . . For in these three terms every class of sin is collected. A person, being ignorant of God, is led into every evil and is called "ungodly." Another, while knowing God and wanting to keep the commandment, is conquered by the frailty of the flesh and becomes ensnared by the allurements of the present life and is called "weak." Or a person may knowingly and willingly despise the commandment and hate the correction of God and cast his words behind him368 and is named "sinner." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 11, par. 2.

{Gal 2:15; 2 Cor 5:21; 1 Pet 2:22}
(3) Now when Paul, although he elsewhere says, "We who are Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners,"371 numbers himself among the sinners, 372 this is [but] the excellence of his humility.373 For he is imitating the one who, "though he committed no sin was made sin for us,"374 and who, though he was God, lived among men.375 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 11, par. 3.

{Rom 5:8}
(4) For the fact that "Christ died for us while we were still sinners" gives us hope that through him he will much more save us, who have now been purged of sin and justified from the wrath which threatens sinners. And he who so loved strangers and enemies that he gave up his only Son for us unto death,376 how much more will he present those who have become his own and who have been reconciled to himself to eternal salvation. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 11, par. 4.

{Phil 2:6-8; 1 Cor 2:7-8; Jn 16:11; Jn 12:31; Jn 14:30; Lk 10:18}
(4. Cont.) Jesus alone, who, "though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be held fast to,", but he emptied himself."381 And having taken the form of a slave, in accordance with the Father's will, he offered himself as a sacrifice for the whole world382 by handing over his own blood to the ruler of this world.383 This was in accordance with the wisdom which "none of the rulers* of this world understood; for if they would have understood, they would not have crucified the Lord of majesty";384  [1 Cor 2:7-8] nor would that blood after which they thirsted385 have quenched, not so much their thirst as their power; nor would it have destroyed their kingdom;386 nor would what the Lord said in the Gospel have befallen them: "Behold, now the ruler of this world has been condemned";387 and, "Behold, I was seeing Satan falling like lightning from heaven."388   
 *[Origen understands these "rulers" to be Satan and his cohorts]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 11, par. 4.

{Rom 5:9}
(5) Now he says, "Much more now, having been justified by his blood will we be saved from wrath through him." By this he is showing that neither does our faith justify us apart from the blood of Christ nor does the blood of Christ justify us apart from our faith. Of the two, however, the blood of Christ justifies us much more than our faith. And for this reason: It seems to me that, although he plainly said above, "having been justified by faith,"390 here he adds, "how much more then, now, having been justified by his blood"; in order to teach that even if our faith saves us from the coming wrath, and even if our works of righteousness save us,391 nevertheless beyond all these things it is much more the blood of Christ that will save us from the coming wrath.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 11, par. 5.
 
{1 Thess 1:10}
(6) [2nd Psalm:] "Let us be saved by fleeing from the coming wrath,"393 indeed by fleeing wrath in such a way that it does not lay hold of us as we pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, patience, gentleness,394 and other similar things.395 And thus wrath is that to which each one is handed over in proportion to the measure and merit of sins.396 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 11, par. 6.

{Rom 5:10-11}
(1) For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. Not only that, but we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.399   But when some enemy becomes a friend, it is certain that so long as he does the works which God does not love, he is God's enemy. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 12, par. 1.

{1 Cor 15:26}
(2) He who sinned beyond all others is recorded by Paul as the last enemy to be destroyed.401 [1 Cor 15:26] . . . Just as we said above that there exists a certain ultimate enemy,406 so also here certain ones are called God's ultimate friends because of the merits of their virtues. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 12, par. 2.

{Rom 5:10}
(3) Since then these things are so, I do not know whether the one who is still abiding in those works which God hates and for the sake of which there are hostilities between God and men, may be deservedly said to be reconciled to God through the blood of Christ. For how can he who does the things of an enemy be reconciled? But of himself and of those like him Paul deservedly says, "When we were God's enemies we were reconciled to God through the blood407 of his Son." Where such a reconciliation has occurred, where not the word of a suppliant but the blood of a mediator has removed the hostilities between God and men, how great is the disgrace for us to return again to the state of hostility and do the things which he hates, the one whom no one, other than the shedding of his holy blood, reconciled for us. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 12, par. 3.

{Eph 2:11-13; Col 3:5; Gal 2:19-20; Heb 12:4}
(4) But when writing to the Ephesians, Paul recounts in even more detail the matter of reconciliation and hostility and the shedding of Christ's blood, which can more easily open up the passage from the present section, provided we join the former with the latter. Hence he says in this way, "Therefore, remember that at one time you who are Gentiles in the flesh, called 'the uncircumcision' by that which is called 'the circumcision,' done in the flesh by human hands since you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to his covenants of promise, having no hope and being without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace; he has made both groups into one and has broken down the middle wall of the enclosure, the hostility in his own flesh, making void the law with its commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, thus making peace, and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus putting to death that hostility through himself. So he came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him both of us have an access in one Spirit to the Father."408 Notice especially in these words that Christ has broken down the middle wall of the enclosure in his flesh, that is, the hostility;409 and that he reconciled both groups to God in one body through the cross;410 and that in the cross he put to death the hostility. It seems to me that it was not without reason that Paul put down the word "hostility" twice in this passage. First he said that Christ broke down the hostility in his flesh. The second time he says he put it to death at the cross.411 For it seems to me that he breaks down the [hostility] in those who are still carrying on the struggle against sin and who fight against it with all their might; but he puts it to death in those who no longer admit any sin whatsoever, but all their members are entirely dead to sin.412 Among them was he who was saying, "I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me."413 But Christ also killed the hostility in his own flesh in this way when, by his endurance of death, he gave men an example which teaches us to resist sins even to the point of death.414 Not until then, when the hostility has been destroyed in his flesh, did he reconcile men to God through his blood, provided that they keep the covenant of reconciliation inviolate by sinning no longer.

(5) Consequently, his death inflicted death to the hostility which was between us and God. This was the beginning of reconciliation. His resurrection and life, however, conferred salvation to believers, as the Apostle says elsewhere about Christ, "For in that which he died, he died to sin once and for all; but what he lives he lives to God."415 He is said to have died to sin, [but] not his own, for he committed no sin,416 but he died to sin itself, that is, like one who inflicted death upon sin itself by his own death.417 He is said to live to God, just as we too should live not for ourselves or for our own will but for God418 so that, in this way, we can be saved in his life according to him who said, "But it is no longer I who live but it is Christ who lives in me."419 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 4, ch 12, par. 5.

{Rom 5:12-14}
(1) Therefore, just as sin came into this world through one man, and death through sin, and so death passed through to all men in that1 all have sinned. For sin was in the world until the law. But sin is not imputed when there is no law. Yet death exercised dominion from Adam to Moses, in those who sinned 2 in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of that which3 was to come.4 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.1.
1.	In quo. Possibly "in which" or "in whom" or "because." Elsewhere (Comm in Jn 20.39) Origen interprets the eph ho of Rom 5.12 causally, i.e., "because" or "in that." In the present section he is somewhat ambivalent. He seems to allow the interpretation of in quo as a relative clause, i.e., "in whom," namely in Adam. See 5.1.3 and 5.1.14 below. However nowhere does Origen develop the concept of guilt inherited or imputed from Adam, as taught by Augustine and Ambrosiaster in the subsequent doctrine of original sin. 

2.	Origen's text of Rom 5.14 did not have kai and mhv, though he was aware of this reading. See 5.1.37. 
3.	Or "of him who was to come." Futuri can be masculine or neuter. 


{Rom 5:12-14}
(3) For when it is said, "Therefore just as," it would seem necessary that some kind of completion should be added so that it be said: so also this or that. This is what he writes in several other passages, for example when he says, "For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all were made alive."11 Here, however, when he said, "Just as sin came into this world through one man, and death through sin, and so it12 passed through to all men," he did not complete [his thought] to say, for example: so also righteousness came into this world through one man and life through righteousness, and so life passed through to all men, in which13 all have been made alive. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.3.
2.	 Tollinton, Selections, p. 76 n. 2, on this passage: "Origen's comment on this characteristic passage of St. Paul shows real insight. The many ideas, the abrupt changes, the hints of thoughts not developed, the lack of order and control, are all in keeping with Origen's suggestive and appropriate figure." 

{Rom 5:12-14}
(4) At the same time he was also showing that even though righteousness will come into this world through one man and, through righteousness, life will also pass through to all men, nevertheless this does not happen at once in the present, nor does it come to pass to those who are idle. On the contrary it occurs to those who, by a great deal of effort and sweat, are able to ask for what is not seen, knock on that which is closed, and seek what is hidden.21 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.4.

{Rom 5:12-14}
(5) After all, even in the passage, . . . "For just as in Adam all die," he has not said: so also in Christ all have been made alive, or: all are being made alive, but instead, "all will be made alive."22 He wanted to show by this that the present time is one of effort and work, in which merits may be procured through good conduct. The future, on the other hand, is the time when those who die together with Christ in the present life will be made alive.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.5.

{Rom 5:12-18}
(6) Someone else will perhaps say: What seems to be lacking in the things we said above, according to the order of his style, is brought back in later passages, though a bit tardy, where he says, "But it is not the case that just as the gift so the trespass. For if the many died through the trespass of the one, much more surely has the grace of God and the gift in the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for very many."26 With these words he would have declared that what seemed to have been lacking above is completed. What he would have said there, that sin27 had passed through to all men, is not much different from what he says here, that the gift and the grace of Jesus Christ abounded for very many. This is so because "all" men may be understood to mean "very many" men, and it does not seem absurd to take "very many" to mean "all," especially since in what follows he says so explicitly, "Just as the trespass of the one led to condemnation for all men, so also the righteousness of the one leads to the justification of life for all men."28 And in order that he might show still more plainly that "all men" and "many men" mea person and the same thing, he added to these things, "For just as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be made righteous."29 Thus those whom he had above designated as "all men" he has called here "many" with the exact same meaning.30 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.6.

{Rom 5:12-18; 1 Tim 2:14; Gen 3:1; Gen 2:17; Gen 3:5}
(12) First let us ascertain how "sin came into this world through one man and death through sin." Someone may perhaps ask whether it was not in fact the woman who sinned before Adam,56 since it is said of her, "having been seduced she became a transgressor";57 and whether, moreover, the serpent had sinned before her. For it 
sinned when it said to the woman, "What is this God has said, that you must not eat from any tree in paradise?"58 It sinned again when, since God had said, "On whatever day you eat of it you will surely die,"59 it said to the woman, "You will not surely die; but God knew that on whatever day you eat of it your eyes will be opened from that time and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil."60 Well then, if the woman sinned before Adam, and the serpent sinned before the woman, and in another passage the Apostle says, "Adam was not seduced, but the woman was seduced,"61 how can it seem that sin entered through one man and not rather through one woman? For the beginning of sin was from the woman,62 and before the woman from the serpent,63 or from the devil, of whom it is said in the Gospel, "He was a murderer from the beginning."64 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.12.

{Rom 5:12; Gen 2:23}
(13) But observe that the Apostle has held fast to the order of nature in these things. And for this reason, because he was speaking about the sin from which death had passed through to all men, he did not ascribe to the woman the succession of human posterity which succumbed to this death coming from sin but to the man.65 For people do not attribute posterity to the woman but the man, as the Apostle himself says elsewhere, "For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man"; and again, "For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is" not from the woman but "through the woman."66 Therefore the mortal posterity and physical descent are reckoned to the man, as if the source, and not to the woman.67 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.13.

{Heb 7:10; 1 Cor 15:22}
(14) But in order that what we are saying might become clearer, let us add the following as well. The same Apostle writes as follows to the Hebrews, "Moreover Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes. For he was still in the loins of his father Abraham when Melchizedek met him as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings."68 If then Levi, who is born in the fourth generation after Abraham, is declared as having been in the loins of Abraham, how much more were all men, those who are born and have been born in this world, in Adam's loins when he was still in paradise.69 And all men who were with him, or rather in him, were expelled from paradise when he was himself driven out from there;70 and through him the death which had come to him from the transgression consequently passed through to them as well, who were dwelling in his loins; and therefore the Apostle rightly says, "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."71 So then it is neither from the serpent who had sinned before the woman, nor from the woman who had become a transgressor before the man,72 but through Adam, from whom all mortals derive their origin, that sin is said to have entered, and through sin, death.

{1 Cor 15:47-49; Col 3:10; 2 Cor 3:18; 2 Cor 4:16}
(15) But it is certainly one man through whom sin entered, and through sin, death, the one whom the Apostle himself calls elsewhere, "The first was of the earth, earthly," but the second one was "heavenly."73 This is the passage where he encourages us to bear the image of the heavenly after casting off the image of the earthly;74 that is to say, by living according to the Word of God we are to be renewed and remade in the inner man after the image of God, who created him.75

{Rom 6:8; Col 2:20; Eph 2:6; Phil 3:20}
(16) But if sin and death entered into this world and inhabit this world, it is certain that those who are dead to this world through Christ, or rather with Christ, are strangers to death and sin. Having been raised with him,80 they have even merited to sit with him in the heavenly places.81 Their citizenship is no longer in this world but in heaven,82

{Rom 5:12; Ezek 18:20; Ezek 18:4}
 (19) "And through sin," he says, "death." Without a doubt this is the death concerning which the prophet says, "The soul which sins will die."95 Of this death one could rightly say that bodily death is a shadow.96 For wherever the one goes, the other necessarily follows, just as the shadow follows the body. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.19.

{Isa 53:9; 1 Pet 2:22; 2 Cor 5:21; Jn 10:18}
(19 con't) But if someone may raise the objection that the Savior committed no sin97 and death did not come to his soul through sin and yet he still endured bodily death, we shall respond to that one that just as the Savior, though he did not commit sin, is nevertheless said to have become sin98 through his taking on flesh for our salvation, so also, although he owed death to no one and was not himself subject to it, nevertheless for our salvation the [death] of that condition taken up by him, of which we have spoken above, he took upon himself freely, not under compulsion like [it was] his shadow. As he himself said, "I have authority to lay down my life, and I have authority to take it up again."99 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.19.

{Rom 5:12; Rom 3:23}
(20) Now let us see how "death passed through to all men." He says, "in that all sinned." With an absolute pronouncement the Apostle has declared that the death of sin passed through to all men in this, that all sinned. As he says elsewhere, "For all have sinned and lack the favor of God."101 
[Note: the different rendering of this verse]
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.20.

{1 Cor 15:55-56; Jn 1:4; Hos 13:14}
(21) But when that death of sin which passed through to all had come to Jesus and had attempted115 to pierce him with its sting-"for the sting of death is sin"116-it was repulsed and broken. "For he was life,"117 and death was inevitably destroyed by life. At that time it is said to [death], "Where, O death, is your sting? Where, O death, is your victory?"118 Because death had conquered all, it is said to death here, "Where, O death, is your victory?" 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.21.

115. Temtasset. Erasmus, CWE 56:144, assumes he means when Christ was tempted by Satan (Mt 4.1-11; Lk 4.1-13). This may be right.  also 5.2.5. 

{Rom 5:12}
(22) Moreover, he has not said that sin came to all men, but "into the world." And death, on the other hand, not "into the world," but "to all men." And it did not "come," but "passed through." I do not think that Paul has made use of this variety of expressions here in vain. . . . He says sin passed through, that is to say, it was indeed there but through the repentance of conversion it was expelled and passed through121 and did not remain any longer in them. Thus it is apparent that in Paul's writings not even one syllable should be understood as devoid of mysteries.122 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.22.

{Rom 5:13; Gen 6:7; Gen 6:17; Gen 19:24; Rom 7:8-9}
(23) Now let us consider the sense of what was said, "For sin was in the world until the law, but sin is not imputed when there is no law." . . . As if sin did not exist before the law! [As if], too, no one sinned, and sin was not reckoned to anyone before the law of Moses was given!124 Even though we read that sin was reckoned both to Cain and Lamech125 and, lest we be delayed by all the individual instances, God was provoked by the sins of men to such a degree that he brought the flood upon the world and said, "I should destroy all flesh on the earth."126 What is more, a rain of fire and burning sulfur devastated the residents of Sodom.127 . . . Later in this very epistle we find him speaking in the following way, "For sin is dead apart from law; but I was once alive apart from law."128 It seems to me that the meaning of each passage is identical. For what was here missing from his expression he has filled in there. "For sin was in this world until the law"; but "dead" is missing. He expressed this more openly in the latter passage. So then, if we add that later expression to the present one and say, "Sin was dead in the world until the law, but sin is not imputed when there is no law," notice how complete the sense can now stand. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.23.

{Rom 7:8-9}
(24) But we have already frequently said this,129 that Paul indeed discusses many different kinds of law in this epistle but very frequently he is speaking about natural law, which can especially be detected here in this passage. For until natural law enters,130 which takes place at a certain age when a person begins to be capable of reason and to be able to discriminate right from wrong and justice from injustice, at that time sin, which previously was considered as if dead among man, is said to revive.131 This happens because there is now an internal law which prohibits; the faculty of reason points out what ought not be done.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.24.

{Ex 21:15-17; Rom 5:13}
(25) But in order that what we are saying may be understood more plainly, let us make use of a clear example.132 It is written, "Whoever strikes father or mother shall surely be put to death";133 and, "Whoever curses his father or mother shall surely be put to death."134 Now suppose a small boy of say four or five years of age, becoming angry from a whipping, as is normal to occur, strikes his father or mother. As far as the precept of the commandment is concerned he deserves death. But because natural law does not yet exist in him, which would teach him that he ought not to inflict an injury upon his father or mother, he is not aware that he has committed an impious crime in this action. To be sure what he is doing has the appearance of sin, for he is striking or cursing his mother, but sin is dead in him, for through the absence of natural law which does not yet exist in him, sin cannot be reckoned to him. For the reasoning capacity in him is not yet great enough to teach him that what he is doing ought not be done. And therefore not only is the boy's action not reckoned as a fault by his parents, but it is taken graciously and with joy. In my opinion what the Apostle says can be logically interpreted in this manner, "For until the law sin was"-here should be supplied "dead"135-"in the world; but sin is not reckoned when there is no law." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.25.

{Rom 7:9-10; Phil 3:5-6}
(26) It is also fitting to interpret in accordance with this explanation what the Apostle says, "I was once alive apart from the law."136 For how can Paul be found ever to live apart from the law of Moses, seeing that he claims concerning himself that he is a Hebrew of Hebrews and that, having been circumcised immediately on the eighth day, he has lived, from birth on, in the observation of the Law, Mosaic?137 It is accepted, however, that he once lived apart from natural law, namely in his childhood, before he was capable of reason. . . . That what follows is being said about natural law he plainly shows when he says, "But when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died."138 By these words he is making clear that at that age, sins were certainly there, but they were considered dead, because they were not reckoned as a fault. But, he says, when I began to know what ought to be done and what must be avoided, and when I began to accept the commandment of the law growing powerful in me, then sin revived within me, which previously seemed dead due to the absence of law. Thus he says, "I died."139 For now sin began to be reckoned against me. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.26.

{Rom 7:9-10}
(27) For Paul did not say that he came to the commandment, but the commandment came to him; and he did not say that sin did not exist in him, but that it was dead and [then] revived. By these statements he is assuredly showing that he was saying both things about one and the same life of his. But let Basilides [who taught transmigration of souls] and those who share his perceptions be left to their own impiety. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.27.

Fn. Origen speaking, from his Commentary on Luke (commenting on Lk 16.6): "Although they [the heretics] seek to expound it, they will be unable to succeed. But I hope to be a man of the Church. I hope to be addressed not by the name of some heresiarch, but by the name of Christ. I hope to have his name, which is blessed upon the earth. I desire, both in deed and in thought, both to be and to be called a Christian."

{Gen 3:14; Jn 2:15; Wis 2:24; Jude 6; Mt 25:41}
(29) Moreover, unless it seems improperly curious, I would like to inquire,147 in response to those who wish the Law of Moses to be understood in these matters through what he says, "But sin is not reckoned when there is no law," whether the devil and his angels seem to be absolved if sin is not reckoned when there is no law. But why then was the serpent condemned even before the law of Moses?148 Or why did death enter the world through the devil's envy?149 What is more, how is it possible to explain what the apostle Jude says in the general epistle? For he says the following: "Even the angels who did not keep their own position, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept bound in eternal chains in deepest darkness for the judgment of the great Day."150 From all of which it is more definitely established that the Apostle is saying these things about the law which every being, both men and also angels, bears naturally within itself by a certain divine dispensation and gift. The strength and power of this law is so great that it convicts even angels. . . . This is the law which drags even the devil and his angels into the eternal fire which has been prepared for them.152 And it is certain that those angels would not be kept bound in eternal chains for judgment nor would those others be thrown into the eternal fire prepared for them if it were not for the fact that they have not kept the law given to them by God, nor would they come to judgment unless they had done something contrary to law. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.29.

{Rom 5:14}
(31) "But death exercised dominion from Adam until Moses in those who sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of that which was to come." Therefore it seems to me that in these matters the Apostle is describing death as if the hostile entrance of some tyrant who wanted to invade the dominions of a rightful king. First he would seize the very passes and entrances into the kingdom by means of collusion with the guard. Then he would attempt to turn the hearts of everyone in the kingdom to himself and, for the most part, he would succeed. In this way he would lay claim to a kingdom not his own. Therefore, while he is ruling through tyranny a commander chosen by the rightful king is sent-Moses, who must call back the people who have been taken over by the [tyrant] to the laws of civilized rule and must teach them to make use of the laws of the true king. But that tyrant, i.e., the death of sin, who had stolen his way in because of the collusion with the first guard, was ruling over all those who had fallen away by a transgression similar to that of the first man. But the commander of the lawful ruler does everything in order that he might lead at least some of the people out of the kingdom of sin and death. He succeeds at last in converting one nation and anyone else who wants to join himself to that nation. And by an order of the king, first of all he instituted sacrifices, by means of which, when they are offered according to certain formalities, he could say, "and their sin shall be forgiven them."154 And so it was only then that a certain part of mankind began to be liberated from the kingdom of sin and death. For that tyrant, who is called death, was exercising dominion from Adam, who was the first to give entrance to him by his own collusion. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.31.

{Rom 5:14}
(32) "Therefore death exercised dominion from Adam until Moses" in the form we have set down above, not over all people, but "over those who sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression." For death did indeed enter the world and it passed through to all, but it did not exercise dominion in everyone. For it is one thing to pass through and another to exercise dominion. To be sure sin passed through even the righteous and grazed them with a certain light infection.156 But in transgressors, i.e., in those who surrender themselves to it with their entire mind and allegiance, it seizes dominion and rules over them with complete authority. . . . "Until Moses," that is, until the Law. For through the Law the cleansing of sins began to be ushered in. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.32.

155.  5.10.11. Origen's assessment of Moses' role in salvation history is strikingly positive. See also Hom in Ex 4.6; Cels 4.31; 5.42. 
161. Rom 8.3. 

{Ps 43:3; Ps 144:5; Ps 44:26; Rom 8:3; Col 2:15}
(33) But because his power of domination was so great, greater even than the strength of the Law, prophets are sent as reinforcements to the Law. But even they, realizing that the tyrant's power exceeded their strength, pray for the coming and presence of the king, calling out to God, "Send your light and your truth!"158 and again, "Bow the heavens and come down!"159 and once more, "Arise, O Lord, bring help to us!"160 Therefore Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came and "in that the Law was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh on account of sin, condemned sin in the flesh." Indeed he also reconciled the world to God and disarmed the principalities and powers of the tyrant, triumphing over them in himself.163 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.33.

{Rom 5:14}
(34) Therefore the "death" of sin "exercised dominion from Adam until Moses," that is, until the coming of Christ. For it is called the Law of Moses and the Law, as is written, held its place until John the Baptist, from which time Jesus began to proclaim the kingdom of God.166 But the fact that [Paul] has made particular mention of certain ones in whom death exercised dominion when he says, "Death exercised dominion in those who sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression," does not seem to me to be said without reference to a certain mystery. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.34.

{Rom 5:14; Gen 4:4}
(35) [But perhaps] everyone who is born from Adam, the transgressor, seems to be indicated and retain in themselves the likeness of his transgression, taken not only by descent from him but also by instruction. For all who are born in this world are not only raised by their parents but instructed as well;169 and not only are they sins' children but also sins' pupils. But when a person matures and the freedom of doing what one likes comes around, a person either goes the way of his fathers, as is written of several kings,170 or he advances along the road of his Lord God. After all, it seems to me that something like this is also indicated concerning Abel in that which is written, "But after days Abel offered a sacrifice to God from the firstborn of his sheep and from their fat portions."171 Thus, what he says, "after days," shows that in the early days of his life he was being held fast by the lessons he learned from his father's transgression. But after those days he came to his senses and looked to God, having been admonished by the law of nature, and then he offered a sacrifice to God. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.35.

{Rom 5:14}
 (36) It is possible, then, either for this passage to be explained in this fashion simply, or to be considered a mystery, hidden in that which he says, "in the likeness of Adam's transgression." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.36.

{Acts 2:24; Mt 12:43; Mt 27:52-53; Ps 68:18; Eph 4:8; Jn 20:39; 1 Cor 15:26; Mt 12:83; Rom 6:12}
(37) If, on the other hand, as it reads in some manuscripts, "even in those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression,"176 this death, namely that which was keeping souls bound in the underworld, is said to exercise dominion, then we shall understand it to mean that even the saints had fallen prey to that death certainly under the law of dying, even if not under the punishment of sin. But it was on this account that Christ descended into the underworld, not only because he would not be held by death,177 but also in order that he might release those who were held there,178 as we said, not so much through the crime of transgression as much as by the condition of dying. As it is written, "Many bodies of saints who were sleeping were resurrected with him and entered into the holy city."179 In this as well the prophet's sayings were fulfilled, in which he said of Christ, "In ascending on high he led captivity captive."180 Thus by his own resurrection he has already destroyed the dominions of death, which is also why it is written that he set captivity free. Listen now to when the Apostle says that the enemy and tyrant, whose dominions [Christ] destroyed, is going to be destroyed:181 He says, "The last enemy is destroyed, death."182 The kingdom of death has already been destroyed, then, and the captivity which was being held under its authority has been led away. But because that enemy and tyrant is still ultimately to be destroyed at the end of the age,183 that is why we see him even now, I do not say reigning so much as robbing. Having been expelled from his kingdom, we see him going around through deserts and wastelands184 seeking to gather to himself a band of unbelievers. That is why the Apostle cries out, "Therefore do not let sin exercise dominion in your mortal bodies any longer, to make you obey its desires."185 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.37.

176. Origen knew of both readings and did not decide on which was correct. On Origen's respect for the divergent manuscript readings preserved in the churches, see 3.1.6.

{Rom 5:14; Eph 5:32; Mt 14:17; 1 Cor 15:21; Rom 5:19}
(38) After these things he says additionally, "who is a type of that which was to come." This expression certainly seems ambiguous to me. Is Adam said to be a type of that which was coming in the future from the time the Apostle was writing these things, or of an age to come? Or is it of a future from himself, that is, from the time of Adam, so as to be interpreted of Christ, a time which, for the Apostle as he wrote these things, was not the future but the past? Although in another passage as well the same Apostle, while speaking of Adam and Eve, would say, "This is a great mystery; but I am speaking of Christ and the Church."186 In that passage he appears to have given us to understand that Adam is being called a type of that which was to come, in that Christ came to unite the Church with himself.187 Admittedly, I do not know how anyone can link Adam's transgression and sin and the fact that death passed through him to all men to a type of Christ except on the basis of contraries,188 as the same Apostle explains later when he says, "For just as death came through one man, so also is the resurrection of the dead through one man."189 And again, "For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one many will be made righteous."190 But if we understand that the Apostle was saying that Adam is a type of that which is to come (i.e. in the future from the time when he was writing these things), then it should be understood all the more that, just as death exercised dominion in this age through one man, Adam, and the whole human race became mortal, so also in the future age life shall reign through Christ and the whole human race will be bestowed with immortality.191 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.38.

{Col 2:16-17; Heb 10:1}
(39) I have said that Paul's expression here is ambiguous when he says, "who is a type of that which was to come." Similarly, I find that what he wrote to the Colossians is also ambiguous, where he says, "Therefore do not let anyone condemn you in matters of food and drink or with regard to festivals, new moons, or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come."192 And in another place the same Apostle says likewise, "For the Law contains the shadow of the good things to come."193 In both texts, at any rate, there is a similar lack of certainty as to whether food and drink and festivals and new moons and Sabbaths contain the shadow of the things to come in the sense that at the coming of Christ the reality of the shadow itself would be fulfilled, or whether it is to be fulfilled in the age to come. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.39.

{Acts 10:9; Acts 10:15; 1 Cor 11:25; Lk 22:20; 1 Cor 5:7-8; Num 23:5-7; Mal 3:20; Wis 5:6; Jer 17:21; Jer 17:27; Ex 16:29; Ex 35:3; Isa 50:11}
(40) So then anyone who wants to claim that these things have been fulfilled at the coming of Christ will assert that the matters of food and drink were fulfilled where Peter sees in a vision every sort of animal lowered in a sheet, and he hears a voice, "What God has made clean, you should not call common."195 Doubtless this refers to the different customs of men. He will call the cup of the new covenant the drink.196 He will approve of a festival if it be the one where "Christ our Passover lamb was sacrificed."197 The festival we celebrate "not with the old yeast but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."198 In a similar way he will show that new moons, i.e., new months, are accomplished through Christ, "the sun of righteousness,"199 and his [twelve] apostles. What is more he will teach that Sabbaths are to be observed by not carrying around the burden200 of sin, but by standing in one's own place201 steadfastly, not the kindling fire202 of which it is said through the prophet, "Go in the light of your fire and in the flame which you have kindled in yourselves."203

{Heb 12:22; Mt 26:29; Hos 9:5; Ps 77:5; Deut 32:7; Heb 4:9}
(41) On the other hand someone else who transfers these types and the shadow204 of the law to the future age205 considers them to be images of the heavenly ministries which are to be fulfilled in that heavenly Jerusalem.206 He will try to assign a meaning to food and drink in accordance with what the Lord says, "Until I shall drink it with you anew in the kingdom of my Father."207 Moreover he will speak of a festival in accordance with the saying of the prophet, "What will you do on the day of the appointed festival and on the feast day of the Lord?"208 He will look for new moons, that is, new months, in those eternal years of which the prophet says, "I have called to mind the eternal years and have meditated";209 and again in the song of Deuteronomy, "Remember the eternal days."210 And of the Sabbath it is said, "So then a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God."211 He will go on to say that just as each of these things contains a type of the age to come, so also can Adam, of whom it is said, "who is a type of that which was to come," be referred to the matter of the future age. And this is why, after it was first set out about those "who sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression," it was added, "who is a type of that which was to come." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 1, par.41.

{Rom 5:15-16}
(1) But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died through the trespass of the one, much more surely will the grace of God and the gift in the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound for very many. And the gift is not like the one man who sins. For the judgment from the one brought condemnation, but the grace following many trespasses brings justification.212 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.1.

{Rom 5:14-17; Rom 5:19-21}
(2) Above, the Apostle had said of Adam, "He is a type of that which was to come," . . . And he begins with this expression, just as if explaining in what sense he might call Adam a type of Christ. He says, "For if the many died through the trespass of the one," i.e., in Adam, obviously, "much more surely will the grace of God and the gift in the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound for very many." That is to say: If death, finding room, by the one who sins was able to be spread to very many, how much more will the grace of God, which has abounded in greater supply and more broadly in Christ, in comparison with death in Adam be diffused to very many. Furthermore, the extent of the situations brought about respectively by the transgression and the gift is not the same. For when judgment comes from Adam's single act of transgressing215 the result is that condemnation came to all men. In contrast, however, justification was given to all through Christ from many transgressions, in which the whole human race was being held so that, just as death had exercised its dominion in transgressions through the one, so also through the obedience of the one, life would reign through righteousness.216 It was therefore not without profound skill in speaking that the Apostle calls Adam a type of Christ.217 The type is similar in genus but contrary in species.218 For the type is similar in genus in that, just as something is diffused to very many men from the one Adam, so also something is diffused to very many men from the one Christ. But the species is contrary because the transgression which began with Adam "made the many sinners," whereas by Christ's obedience "many will be made righteous."219 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.2.

{1 Cor 15:45; 1 Cor 15:47; Rom 5:12; Rom 5:15; Rom 5:19}
(4) The Apostle has set out to make known what "the first Adam," who "became a living soul," brought to the human race, and also what "the second Adam," who is a "lifegiving spirit," brought about.220 He says that, through the transgression of the one, sin appeared, and through sin death entered and passed through to all men; to be more precise and so that we might preserve the restraint found in Paul's letters, which he has preserved in this passage, I should say, "to many men."221 But through Christ's obedience justification abounded and through justification life abounded much more for very many.222

(5) He wants also to show that life is much stronger than death, and righteousness than sin, and by this means to teach that if sin and death were able to exercise dominion in this way in men, having received a beginning from the disobedience of the one man, how much more powerfully and deservedly will life reign through righteousness,223 receiving its beginning through the obedience of the one, namely Christ; Christ, I say, who came to this task not from the compulsion of his nature but moved by compassion alone. For he was "in the form of God"; and when he sees that death is exercising dominion through the people by the transgression of the one man, he is not oblivious to his own creation, nor does he "regard equality with God as something to be held fast to," that is, he does not consider it a matter of any great importance to himself that he is indeed equal to God and is one with the Father, but rather that death is laying waste to his own work, having gained entrance through one man's transgression.224 Therefore "he empties himself" from the equality and form of God and takes "the form of a slave"225 and becomes man. He who was exercising his dominion over everyone [i.e. Satan] even dared to tempt him, but he could not enter Him.226 Yet he accepts that common death,227 since he would not receive the death of sin which was ruling over everyone.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.5.

{1 Cor 2:6; 1 Cor 15:22}
(6) It is not without that profound wisdom which Paul claims to speak among the perfect229 that he has moderated his words in this passage.230 And what he had elsewhere called "all men,"231 he has designated here as "many" or "very many," where he makes a comparison between the sin and death, which was diffused from Adam to all men, and the justification and life which derived from Christ. He did this lest he soften his audience, had he pronounced without qualification that, in an identical manner and in the same measure in which the death of sin was diffused from Adam unto all men, so also will the justification and life which come from Christ be diffused to all men, lest they become more lazy in obedience, being certain of a guarantee of life which was to be given to all men through Christ's grace. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.6.

{1 Cor 15:22; Rom 5:14-15; Rom 5:19}
(7) For this reason he restrains his words and does not put down "all men," as is usual in other places, but "many," who have been made sinners through the transgression of the one. Similarly he does not assert that the gift in the grace of God through the one man Jesus Christ abounds to "all" but to "very many," in order to keep the more negligent of his hearers in check with fear and to make them apprehensive. , without closing the mysteries of the divine goodness for those who are more perfect.232 It is well that he has set down that those to whom the gift of grace will reach are more than those who were made sinners by the transgression of the one.233 Indeed I am convinced that there is also some hidden mystery in this, because elsewhere he says that death had exercised dominion from Adam until Moses, not in all but only in those who sinned according to the likeness of Adam's transgression.234 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.7.

{Rom 5:16-18; Wis 10:1; 1 Cor 1:24}
(8) Yet even by the simpler interpretation it can seem they are called "more" since, even though those who became sinners from Adam are many, yet those who are being made alive through the grace of Christ are called "more" because [Adam] himself, from whom the death of sin was diffused to the others, is added to their number. For he himself will be saved with all those whom he had made subject to his transgression,235 just as it is said about Wisdom, "She protected the first-formed father of the world, when he alone had been created; and she delivered him from his own sin."236 But what Wisdom is this which delivered the first man from his own sin if not Christ, who is "the power of God and the wisdom of God"?237 [Wis 10:1] So then Christ leads back more to life than Adam led into death because Christ has called even Adam himself, who was the cause of death for the others, back to life so that what the Apostle writes in what follows is true, "Through the grace of the one comes the justification of life for all men."238 But Adam is also a man; therefore the justification of life shall reach him as well.239 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.8.


{Rom 5:12-14; Rom 5:18; Jn 3:3; Titus 3:5; Mt 28:19; 1 Tim 6:3}
(9) But you will perhaps say: If death passed through to all men because of one who sinned, and likewise by the righteousness of the one the justification of life reached unto all men,240 then we have done nothing that we should die or that we should live, but indeed Adam is the cause of death, and Christ, the cause of life.
(10) Certainly we have already said above241 that parents not only produce sons but they also educate them. And those who are born become not only sons of their parents but also their pupils; and they are not prodded into the death of sin so much by nature as by instruction. . . . He has done this according to Adam, and in these persons death reigns from Adam,242 that is from birth, until the time of the law,243 when, since he reaches the point of being able to discern between right and wrong, he is enabled to receive Christ's grace. At that point he leaves behind Adam, who had begotten or taught him unto death, and he follows Christ, who teaches him and gives birth to him unto life. 
(11) Now do you wish to understand that it was not only by birth but also by instruction that death exercised its dominion from Adam?244 This can be learned from the contraries. For when the Lord Jesus Christ had come to amend what had been done wrongly, in view of the fact that the first birth, which came from Adam, was born to death, he introduces a second birth, which he called not so much being born as being reborn.245 Doubtless it was through this second birth that he wiped away the blemish of the first birth. And just as he substituted birth with rebirth, so also he replaced one teaching with another. For when he sent his own disciples to do this task, he did not merely say, "Go, baptize all nations," but, "Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."246 Therefore, because he knew that both were at fault, he gave a remedy for both, so that even our mortal birth would be changed by the rebirth of baptism, and the teaching of godliness might shut out the teaching of godlessness.247
(12) Death exercised dominion in us,248 therefore, not without our own active engagement in sin; just as, on the other hand, life will reign in us not by our being idle and not by our doing nothing. But indeed the beginning of life is given by Christ not to those who are unwilling, but to those who believe. It spreads to the perfection of life by means of the perfecting of the virtues, just as formerly a beginning of death had spread by means of the imitation of transgression and by the carrying out of the vices. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk. 5, ch. 2, par. 9-12. 

{Jn 13:17; Mt 5:26}
(14) For if you should ask: When will life reign through Jesus Christ? . . . And he said to them, 'You are blessed if you do these things.'"259 Therefore we shall be blessed at that time when we are able not only to hear and understand the Word of God, but also to do it. For although it is promised that a person may eventually come out of prison, nevertheless it is ordained that no one can come out from there unless each one pays back even the last penny.260 But if not even the penalty of one penny, which is that of the smallest sin, is remitted until it is atoned for in prison by means of punishments,261 how is it possible for someone to be set free by the hope of being exempted from punishment, or how will he regard the gift of grace as a license to sin?262 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.14.


{Rom 5:14; Rom 5:16; Rom 5:18}
(15) Through our one Lord Jesus Christ grace began to reign through righteousness. It will reign in all who obey him and keep his words, and by this means they come from many transgressions to the justification of life.263 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 2, par.15.

{Rom 5:17}
(1) For if, by the trespass of the one, death exercised dominion through that one, much more surely will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.264 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.1.

{Rom 5:17; Rom 5:15}
(2) But as for "those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness," not only does death no longer exercise dominion over them, which would certainly even in itself be no small grace, but also two other goods are conferred on them. First, instead of death, life reigns in them, namely Christ Jesus. Second, they themselves will likewise reign through the one, Jesus Christ. . . . [So] it is clear in what sense "the gift is not like the trespass." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.2.
 
{Rom 5:17; Ezek 18:4; Ps 22:15}
(3) Well then, what he says, "By the transgression of the one, death exercised dominion through the one," shows that dominion is granted to death through transgression; it cannot exercise dominion in anyone unless it receives the right to rule from transgression. What seems to be made known in this is that since a soul created by God is itself free, it leads itself into slavery by means of transgression and hands over to death, so to speak, the IOU269 of its own immortality which it had received from its own Creator. "For the soul that sins will die."270 That soul, after all, cries out through the prophet, saying, "You have led me down to the dust of death."271 This assuredly could not have come to pass to the person except as a result of transgression. Therefore it seems plain that the soul had composed its own IOU with death by means of transgression, so that, having lost the freedom of immortality, it took up the yoke of sin and the dominion of death. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.3.

{Rom 5:17}
(4) Because the Apostle wanted to show how much more a soul has received through Christ than it had lost through Adam, he repeats these expressions . . . all of which most certainly declare how much more abundant the gifts are than the losses. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.4.

{Rom 5:17}
(5) But as for those whom he says are going to reign in life through Jesus Christ, I ask: Over whom are they going to reign? It seems to me that just as he shows that the dominion of death272 was in those whom, by sinning, it made subject to it,273 so also with regard to those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness and who are said to be going to reign through the one Jesus Christ, he is pointing to a future dominion over those who become subjected to them in instruction in the kingdom of God.
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.5.

{1 Cor 15:26; 1 Cor 15:55-56}
(6) The dominion of that death is described here, which is said elsewhere to be Christ's ultimate or last enemy to be destroyed.279 He is destroyed in that he would no longer exercise dominion. But if he no longer exercises dominion, it is certain that transgression, in which alone the dominion of death consists, will no longer exist in the future. Doubtless it will be at that time when it will be said to it, "Where, O Death, is your sting?" For indeed, as the Apostle himself says, "The sting of death is sin." 280
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.6.


{Jn 14:6; Heb 2:14; 1 Cor 15:24-26; 1 Cor 15:28; Mt 6:10; Lk 11:2; Mt 4:17; Heb 2:8; Mt 10:34}
(7) But I would like to ask particularly: Since we have indeed said that death had held dominion until the arrival of Christ,282 who is life,283 [M1028] but the Apostle says that Christ had come not only to destroy death but also him who was holding the power of death, i.e., the devil,284 who is reigning? That is, before that which is written happens, "Then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father."285 For if we should say what seems logical, that life reigns when death has been destroyed, it could be objected to us: Why then is sin still being committed? It is clear that death exercises its dominion through sin. But if we should say that Christ, i.e., life, reigns in certain souls, and death in certain others, what persons shall we find in whom the dominion of life exists in such a way that the dominion of death has no authority in them? In other words, who is entirely free from sin? These matters seem to me to pertain instead to the future kingdom, and there those things are to be fulfilled where it is said, "That God may be all in all."286 For this is why we are taught to say in the Lord's prayer, "Your kingdom come!"287 as if it has not yet come.288 And the Lord himself, when he began to preach, does not say: The kingdom of heaven has come, but: "The kingdom of heaven has come near."289 The present time, however, I would say seems not so much a time of reigning as of war.290 Through this war the future kingdom is being striven for. Yet Christ can be said to reign even in this time of war, since the dominion of death is now broken in part and being gradually destroyed, a dominion which had previously spread itself out to all men. This agrees with the words of Scripture, "For he must reign until he puts every enemy under his feet."291 He likewise says in another passage, "But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him."292 Whence it appears that what he says, "For he must reign,"293 he used instead of, "He [must] prepare a kingdom." For it is certain that the strong man first must be fought and bound and in this way his property must be plundered.294 For this reason as well the Savior himself says, "I have not come to bring peace but a sword."295 Therefore the fight must be fought for a long time by those who want to reign in life through Jesus Christ, until "death, the last enemy, should be destroyed."296 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.7.

{Rom 5:17; Wis 9:6; 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Pet 1:2; Col 4:6; 1 Cor 10:31; Ps 106:3}
(8) Moreover, concerning "the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness," it needs to be known that someone does not enter this kingdom, which we said is being prepared by means of war,297 who has attained [only] a single grace, that is to say, who has pleased God in respect to only one work. On the contrary, an abundance of grace is required according to him who says, "But I labored more abundantly than all of them; but not I but the grace of God with me."298 He prays similar things as well for those whom he instructed [M1029] when he says, "Grace to you and peace be multiplied!"299 Therefore grace is multiplied and abounds if our speech is always seasoned in grace as with salt300 and if our deeds are done with the grace of humility and sincerity, and if everything we do, we do for the glory of God.301 The gift of righteousness should be interpreted in a similar way. For one who is justified by Christ should do nothing without righteousness, according to him who says, "Blessed are those who practice judgment and preserve righteousness at all times,"302 and according to what Wisdom declares when she says, "Even if someone is perfect among the sons of men, if he does not have the righteousness from God it shall be reckoned to him as nothing."303 In this way, those who will have had the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 3, par.8.

{Rom 5:18}
(1) Accordingly just as through the trespass of the one came condemnation to all men, so also through the righteousness of the one comes the justification of life to all men.304 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 4, par.1.

{Rom 5:18}
(2) How, or rather which, condemnation would come to all men must of course be seen. Perhaps it can suffice us according to the simple interpretation to say that the condemnation of transgression is that common death308 which comes to all and will come to all, even if they seem righteous.309 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 4, par.2.

{Gen 5:24; Heb 11:5; 2 Kings 2:11}
(3) But if perhaps anyone would object to this over the cases of Enoch and Elijah, who were translated so as to not see death,310 this will be disposed of in the following manner: things that are said about all men shall not immediately be deemed false if any dispensation of God has been made in the case of one or two men. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 4, par.3.

310. Gn 5.24; Heb 11.5; 2 Kgs 2.11. 

{Rom 5:1-2}
(2 con't) But someone could reasonably, as I judge, suggest in this place, that when Adam had transgressed it is written that the Lord God expelled him from paradise and established him in that land opposite to the paradise of delights.311 And this was the condemnation for his transgression which doubtless spread to all men. Foreveryone was fashioned in that place of humiliation and in the valley of tears;312 whether because all who are born from him were in Adam's loins and were equally expelled with him or, in some other inexplicable fashion known only to God, each person seems to be driven out of paradise and to have received condemnation.313 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 4, par.3.

{Rom 5:18}
(1) For just as by the one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of the one many will be made righteous. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 5, par.1.

{Rom 5:18; Mt 8:11; Rom 5:12; Job 14:4-5 [LXX]}
(2) There will be no difficulty in understanding how, by the obedience of the one, not all but many are made righteous according to what the Lord says in the Gospel, "For many will come from the east and west and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God."318 And he did not say, "All will come." But we need to show how it can be that many, and not all, seem to be sinners, although the same Apostle says that "all have sinned."319
(3) It is one thing "to have sinned," another to be "a sinner." One is called a sinner who, by committing many transgressions, has already reached the point of making sinning into a habit. . . . Just as, on the other hand, one is not called righteous who has once or twice done some righteous act, but who continually behaves justly and keeps righteousness in use and makes it habitual. For if someone is unjust in nearly all other matters but should carry out some just work one or two times, he will indeed be said to have acted justly in that work in which he practiced justice; nevertheless he will not on that basis be called a just man. Similarly it will indeed be said that a righteous man has sinned if he has at some time committed what is not lawful. But he will not on that account be labeled a sinner, since he does not hold fast to the practice and habit of sinning. Just as one is not called a physician who knows how to place a bandage lightly upon the skin of a head wound, or who can sooth the swelling of an injury with hot water, even though this seems to belong to the art of medicine. Rather one is called a physician who maintains the use and study and instruction of medical science. 
(4) By all this I think it has been sufficiently shown that it is one thing to sin and another to be a sinner. For it can happen that all people commit sin, even if they are holy, since "no one is pure from uncleanness, not even if his life should be one day long."321 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 5, par.2-4.

{Mt 13:17}
(5) However the reckoning of time is also well preserved by the Apostle. For since he referred to the past as the time when many were made sinners, he transferred to the future the time when many are to be made righteous, knowing, doubtless, that by the progression of the proclamation of the gospel the multitude of the righteous would grow larger. But, that many were righteous even before the coming of the Savior, the Lord likewise testifies in the Gospels when he says, "Many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see."322 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 5, par.5.

{1 Tim 1:13-15; 1 Cor 15:9; Gal 1:13; Acts 8:3; Acts 9:2}
(6) But suppose someone objects to us that the Apostle says even about himself, "Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners-of whom I am the foremost,"324 as if he seems to call himself a sinner. . . . But it is another matter for a righteous man to become his own accuser326 and to humble himself, so that he might be exalted by God.327 Although Paul, in that he says that he had persecuted the church of God and had fought against it328 and had even dragged off men and women and had them thrown in prison,329 indeed would have done this out of ignorance and he would attain mercy;330 nevertheless it must be admitted that while he was doing these things, he had to be called a sinner perhaps not undeservedly. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 5, par.6.

{1 Tim 1:13-15}
(7) You may find in the Holy Scriptures many things of this sort in which you will discover both that the righteous man has committed sin and the sinner has done some righteous things. Nevertheless you will not find either the righteous man called a sinner because he sinned in some matter, or the sinner designated as a righteous man because he did something just. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 5, par.7.

{Rom 6:17; Phil 2:8; Rom 5:19}
(9) So then Adam offered sinners a model through his disobedience; but Christ, in contrast, gave the righteous a model by his obedience. As it is written in another passage, "But you have become obedient from the heart to the same model of teaching to which you were entrusted."336 It is also on this account that he "became obedient unto death,"337 in order that those who follow the example of his obedience might be made righteous by righteousness itself, just as those others were made sinners by following the model of [Adam's] disobedience.338 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 5, par.9.

{Rom 5:20-21}
(1) But law entered by stealth, so the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace superabounded so that, just as sin exercised dominion in death, so grace might also reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.339 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.1.

{Marcion; Gen 18:20-21}
(2) Indeed, if no one had sinned before the Law was given through Moses, then Marcion and the other heretics, who want to accuse the law based on these words of the Apostle, seem to seize this opportunity, as if the reason the Law was given was in order that sin, which did not exist before the Law, might abound. Yet I do not know what time period they could find prior to the giving of the Law which was void of sins. [Origen lists the many sins up to the Flood.] Who then can be so stupid as to deny that sin abounded in all these instances? Or certainly when God said of the residents of Sodom, "I have come down to see if, according to the outcry of the Sodomites, their iniquities have been finished off";347 or when they surrounded Lot's house, endeavoring to commit acts of lewdness even against angels. . . . Assuredly the law of Moses had not yet entered by stealth when such a blot of sins were being diffused throughout the earth. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.2.


{Natural Law; Rom 2:14-15}
(3) From all these testimonies it is deduced that the heretics whom we mentioned above,350 and whoever there is who agrees with them in interpreting these words as spoken about the law of Moses, have been unable to touch even remotely upon the Apostle's meaning.351 Instead, this passage ought to be understood, as we have already repeatedly said,352 of the law of nature. . . . This law has been inscribed by the one who created man in the beginning354 on the governing part of man's heart355 so that at the proper time, when the pages of that mind will have matured, . . . this law would begin to be diffused in the inner workings of the conscience and to fill the mind with reason. Then the will of the flesh arises and suggests other desires which are contrary to the commands naturally suggested by this sort of law.356 And this is what this Apostle himself has designated as the law in the members, resisting the law of the mind.357 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.3.

{Natural Law; Rom 2:14-15; Rom 5:20}
(4) It seems that the Apostle here in this passage has described a law of the members which, he says, entered by stealth so sin might abound. Even the word he has used seems to me to be pointing very clearly to what we are saying. . . . After all, to enter by stealth means that when the one thing had entered the other came in under the cover of the first.359 The meaning which we explained above is what is plainly pointed to, that under the cover of natural law, which the Apostle named the law of the mind which consents to the law of God,360 the law of the members has arisen which, by suggesting the desires of the flesh and by leading man captive, inclined toward lust and pleasures, makes sin abound in him. In this way then "the law entered by stealth so the trespass might abound." 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.4.

{Rom 5:20}
(5) "But where sin abounded," he says, "grace superabounded." . . . For the grace of Christ superabounded in that not only would it absolve man from past sins, but it would also fortify him against future ones. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.5.

{Natural Law; Rom 2:14-15; Rom 5:20; Rom 6:12}
(6) If in fact he wants to show that there are two kingdoms in man-one by which sin exercised dominion in death, the other by which grace would reign through righteousness in life-then it is grace which ejected and expelled sin from its own kingdom,362 i.e., from our members, since death necessarily was equally expelled with it. Not until then would grace lay claim to a kingdom for itself in us through righteousness; and where death had been, eternal life took up residence. This is what the Apostle also says elsewhere, "Therefore, do not let sin reign any longer in your mortal bodies". . . Therefore there is a marvelous superabundance, because where sin and death were, now there is grace and righteousness and eternal life. And these are all things which surpass the others through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.6.

{1 Cor 15:26; 2 Cor 11:6; Judg 2:12; 2 Chr 7:22; 2 Chr 24:18; 2 Chr 24:24; 2 Chr 28:6; Gal 2:15; 1 Tim 1:15}
(7) It may be the case that, just as he said that all these good things come into being through our Lord Jesus Christ, so also he wanted it to be understood that those evils have arisen through the devil. . . . For just as Christ is indeed one in essence but may be designated in many ways according to his virtues and operations365 (for example he is understood to be Grace itself, as well as Righteousness, peace, life, truth, the Word) so perhaps also the devil can himself be understood by various designations. For he should be thought of as the Sin which is said to exercise dominion. Also one has to believe that he is that Death of which it is said, "For the last enemy, death, will be destroyed."367 . . . Furthermore I think that what the Apostle says, "Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal bodies,"369 could be said even more about the devil.370 
(8) So then, it is impossible that a soul exists at any time without having a ruler. But we must make provision that Christ should be that ruler, whose yoke is easy and whose burden is light,371 and not the devil, whose dominion is burdensome. 
Origen, Commentary on Romans, bk 5, ch 6, par.7-8.

NOVATIAN****
{Apostles Creed}
The Rule of truth requires that we should first of all things believe on God the Father and Lord Omnipotent; that is, the absolutely perfect Founder of all things, who has suspended the heavens in lofty sublimity, has established the earth   106038
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 1.   

{Free Will; Gen 2:16-17}
And lest, again, an unbounded freedom should fall into peril, He laid down a command, in which man was taught that there was no evil in the fruit of the tree; but he was forewarned that evil would arise if perchance he should exercise his free will, in the contempt of the law that was given. For, on the one hand, it had behooved him to be free, lest the image of God should, unfittingly be in bondage; and on the other, the law was to be added, so that an unbridled liberty might not break forth even to a contempt of the Giver. So that he might receive as a consequence both worthy rewards and a deserved punishment, having in his own power that which he might choose to do, by the tendency of his mind in either direction:   106057   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 1.

{Gen 3:17-19; Gen 3:24}
Still, nevertheless, God indulgently tempered his punishment by cursing, not so much [Adam] himself, as his labors upon earth. And, moreover, what is required does not come without man's knowledge; but He shows forth man's hope of future discovery and salvation in Christ. And that he is prevented from touching of the wood of the tree of life, is not caused by the malignant poison of envy, but lest, living forever without Christ's previous pardon of his sins, he should always bear about with him for his punishment an immortality of guilt.   106063   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 1.

{Gen 1:6-8; Rom 8:38; Eph 1:21; Eph 6:12}
Nevertheless also, in higher regions; that is, above even the firmament itself, regions which are not now discernible by our eyes, He previously ordained angels, he arranged spiritual powers, He put in command thrones and powers, and founded many other infinite spaces of heavens, and unbounded works of His mysteries.   106066

{Hades}
And truly, what lies beneath the earth is not itself void of distributed and arranged powers. For there is a place whither the souls of the just and the unjust are taken, conscious of the anticipated dooms of future judgment; so that we might behold the overflowing greatness of God's works in all directions, not shut up within the bosom of this world,   106069   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 1.

{2 Pet 3:10-12}
And over all these things He Himself, containing all things, having nothing vacant beyond Himself, has left room for no superior God, such as some people conceive. Since, indeed, He Himself has included all things in the bosom of perfect greatness and power, . . . 
 [The world] can by no force be dissolved, save when He alone who made it commands it to be dissolved, for the purpose of bestowing other and greater things upon us. For we read that He contains all things,   106080   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 2.

{Father, The; 1 Tim 6:16}
For this reason, therefore, He is always unbounded, because nothing is greater than He; always eternal, because nothing is more ancient than He. For that which is without beginning can be preceded by none, in that He has no time. He is on that account immortal,   106084   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 2.

{Father, The; Rom 11:33-36}
nor can it be conceived how great He is, seeing that, if He could be conceived, He would be smaller than the human mind wherein He could be conceived. . . . Whatever could be declared must be less than He, when compared in respect of Himself. . . . For what can you fittingly either say or think concerning Him who is greater than all discourses and thoughts?   106098   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 2.

{1 Kings 8:27; Acts 17:24}
He whom the world does not contain is much less contained in a temple;   106123   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 3.

{Isa 66:2}
says, "And upon whom shall my Spirit rest, save upon him that is lowly, and quiet, and that trembleth at my words?"--so that in some degree one may recognize how great God is, in learning to fear Him by the Spirit given to him:   106125   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 3.

{Father, The; 1 Tim 1:17; Rom 11:33}
Of whom the same apostle, "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory." For He has gone beyond the contemplation of the eyes who has surpassed the greatness of thought. "For," it is said, "of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things." For all things are by His command, because they are of Him; and are ordered by His Word as being through Him;   106133   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 3.

{Evil, Problem of}
those things which are the work of a good Ordainer cannot be other than good; wherefore every evil is a departure from God. . . . Because, moreover, evil does not occur to man from any other cause than by his departure from the good God.   106144  
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 4.
 
{Father, The; Mal 3:6; Ex 3:14}
nor does He ever turn or change Himself into any forms, lest by change He should appear to be mortal. . . . Thus there is never in Him any accession or increase of any part or honor,   

. . . But what He is, He always is; and who He is, He is always Himself; and what character He has, He always has. For increasing argues beginning, as well as losses prove death and perishing. . . . And therefore He says, "I am God, I change not." . . . And thus He says, "I am that I am." For what He is has this name, because it always maintains the same quality of Himself.   106152   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 4.

{Father, The}
And what is not born cannot be changed: for only those things undergo change which are made, or which are begotten. . . . And thus He is declared to be one, having no equal. For whatever can be God, must as God be of necessity the Highest. . . . there cannot be two infinites, as the very nature of things dictates. And that is infinite which neither has any sort of beginning nor end. For whatever has occupied the whole excludes the beginning of another.   106161   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 4.

{Name of God}
Whence it results that God's own name also cannot be declared, because He cannot be conceived. For that is contained in a name which is, in any way, comprehended from the condition of His nature.   106165   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 4.

{Anger of God; Deut 31:17}
Moreover, if we read of His wrath, and consider certain descriptions of His indignation, and learn that hatred is asserted of Him, yet we are not to understand these to be asserted of Him in the sense in which they are human vices.   . . .   For that God is angry, arises from no vice in Him. But He is so for our advantage; for He is merciful even then when He threatens, because by these threats men are recalled to rectitude. For fear is necessary for those who lack the motive to a virtuous life. . . . And thus all those, either angers of God or hatreds, or whatever they are of this kind, being displayed for our medicine,--as the case teaches,--have arisen of wisdom, not from vice, nor do they originate from frailty;   106184   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 5.

{1 Pet 3:12; Ps 34:15; Gen 8:21; Ex 31:18; Isa 1:21; 2 Chr 19:16; Jn 4:21; Jn 4:24}
And although the heavenly Scripture often turns the divine appearance into a human form,--as when it says, "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous;" or when it says, "The Lord God smelled the smell of a good aroma;" or when there are given to Moses the tables "written with the finger of God;" or when the people of the children of Israel are set free from the land of Egypt "with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm;" or when it says, "The mouth of the Lord has spoken these things;" or when the earth is set forth as "God's footstool;" or when it says, "Incline your ear, and hear,"--we who say that the law is spiritual do not include within these lineaments of our bodily nature any mode or figure of the divine majesty. . . . For the prophet then was still speaking about God in parables according to the period of the faith, not as God was, but as the people were able to receive Him. And thus, that such things as these should be said about God, must be imputed not to God, but rather to the people. . . . It is not therefore God who is limited, but the perception of the people is limited. . . . Finally, in the Gospel the Lord said, "The hour shall come when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father;" and gave the reasons, saying, "God is a Spirit; and those therefore who worship, must worship in spirit and in truth."   106206   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 6.

{Mt 28:19-20; Jn 20:21; Acts 1:8}
He willed the apostles, as founders of our family, to be sent by His Son into the whole world, so that the condition of the human race might be conscious of its Founder.    106256   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 8.

{Mt 10:29-30; Deut 29:5}
And lest moreover anyone should think that such an indefatigable providence of God does not reach to even the very least things, "One of two sparrows," says the Lord, "shall not fall without the will of the Father; but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered." And His care and providence did not permit even the clothes of the Israelites to be worn out,   106260   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 8.

{Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7; Ps 68:17}
[Ezek. i. 10 and Rev. iv. 7.]And, moreover, "wheels" lie below--that is to say, the seasons--whereby all the members of the world are always being rolled onwards; such feet being added by which those things do not stand still forever, but pass onward. And, moreover, throughout all their limbs they are studded with eyes; for the works of God must be contemplated with an ever watchful inspection: in the heart of which things, a fire of embers is in the midst, either because this world of ours is hastening to the fiery day of judgment; or because all the works of God are fiery, and are not darksome, but flourish.  . . . This, therefore, according to David, is God's chariot.  "For the chariot of God," says he, "is multiplied ten thousand times;" that is, it is innumerable, infinite, immense. For, under the yoke of the natural law given to all things, some things are restrained, as if withheld by reins; others, as if stimulated, are urged on with relaxed reins. For the world, which is that chariot of God with all things, both the angels themselves and the stars guide; and their movements, although various, yet bound by certain laws, we watch them guiding by the bounds of a time prescribed to themselves;   106277   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 8.

{Creed, Apostles; Father and Son} 
The same rule of truth teaches us to believe, after the Father, also on the Son of God, Christ Jesus, the Lord our God, but the Son of God--of that God who is both one and alone, to wit the Founder of all things, as already has been expressed above. For this Jesus Christ, I will once more say, the Son of this God, we read of as having been promised in the Old Covenant, and we observe to be manifested in the New,   106284   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 9.

{Gen 17:8; Gen 49:10; Ex 4:13; Deut 18:15; Deut 28:66; Isa 11:1; Isa 7:14; Isa 11:10; Hos 6:3; Ps 2:8; Messianic Prophecies}
Genesis itself anticipates Him, when it says: "To you will I give it, and to your seed." He is spoken of when it shows how a man wrestled with Jacob; He too, when it says: "There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a leader from between his thighs, until He shall come to whom it has been promised; and He shall be the expectation of the nations." He is spoken of by Moses when he says: "Provide another whom you may send." He is again spoken of by the same, when he testifies, saying: "A Prophet will God raise up to you from your brethren; listen to Him as if to me." It is He, too, that he speaks of when he says: " you  shall see your life hanging in doubt night and day, and you shall not believe Him." Him, too, Isaiah alludes to: "There shall go forth a rod from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall grow up from his root." The same also when he says: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son." . . . Or that He would rise again from the dead: "And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and one who shall rise to reign over the nations; on Him shall the nations hope, and His rest shall be honor." Or when he speaks of the time of the resurrection: "We shall find Him, as it were, prepared in the morning." . . . Or when He is set forth as possessor of all things: "Ask of me, and I will give You the heathen for your inheritance, and the boundaries of the earth for your possession."   106307   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 9.

{Lk 24:44; Lk 24:27; Jn 5:39}
But of this I remind you, that Christ was not to be expected in the Gospel in any other wise than as He was promised before by the Creator, in the Scriptures of the Old Covenant;   106312   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 10.

{Jn 20:27; Rom 6:5}
And that He was raised again in the same bodily substance in which He died, is proved by the wounds of that very body, and thus He showed the laws of our resurrection in His flesh, in that He restored the same body in His resurrection which He had from us.   106337   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 10.

{1 Cor 15:50}
because, when it is written that "flesh and blood do not inherit the kingdom of God," it is not the substance of the flesh that is condemned, which was built up by the divine hands that it should not perish, but only the guilt of the flesh is rightly rebuked. . . . Because in baptism and in the dissolution of death the flesh is raised up and returns to salvation, by being recalled to the condition of innocence when the mortality of guilt is put away.   106342   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 10.

{Christ, Divinity of; Jn 1:1; Father and Son}
so as to maintain, by the association of the divinity of the Word in that very materiality, that He was also God according to the Scriptures. For there is a great risk of saying that the Savior of the human race was only man. . . . For this contempt of the heretics will recoil also upon God the Father, if God the Father could not beget God the Son.   106353   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 11.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 1:1; Jesus-God and Man}
For they regard the weaknesses in Christ as if they were a man's weaknesses, but they do not count the powers as if they were a God's powers. . . . They keep in mind the infirmities of the flesh, they exclude the powers of the divinity. . . . It has as much described Jesus Christ to be man, as moreover it has also described Christ the Lord to be God. Because it does not set forth Him to be the Son of God only, but also the Son of man;   106364   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 11.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 1:14; Jn 1:18; Col 1:15; Jesus-God and Man}
For as nature itself has prescribed that he must be believed to be a man who is of man, so the same nature prescribes also that He must be believed to be God who is of God; but if he should not also be God when he is of God, no more should he be man although he should be of man.   106366   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 11.

{Rom 1:3-4; Jn 17:5; Jn 8:58; Jesus-God and Man}
For in the manner that as man He is of Abraham, so also as God He is before Abraham himself. . . . And in the same manner as He is born as man subsequent to the world, so as God He is manifested to have been before the world. And in the same way as He was begotten as man of the seed of David, so also the world is said to have been ordained by Him as God.   106373   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 11.

{Hos 1:7; Christ, Deity of}
For, behold, Hosea the prophet says in the person of the Father: "I will not now save them by bow, nor by horses, nor by horsemen; but I will save them by the Lord their God." If God says that He saves by God, still God does not save except by Christ. . . . Why, then, should man hesitate to call Christ God, when he observes that He is declared to be God by the Father according to the Scriptures?   106386   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 12.

{Isa 7:14; Mt 28:20; Christ, Deity of}
For in the same way as Isaiah says, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and you shall call His name Emmanuel, which is, interpreted, God with us;" so Christ Himself says, "Lo, I am with you, even to the consummation of the world."   106390   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 12.

{Christ, Deity of; Sabellianism}
For now they cannot deny Him to be God. As God the Father, or as God the Son? If as the Son, why do they deny that the Son of God is God? If as the Father, why do they not follow those who appear to maintain blasphemies of that kind?   106401   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 12.

{Christ, Deity of; Sabellianism; Hab 3:3; Father and Son}
He says by Habakkuk the prophet: "God shall come from the south, and the Holy One from the dark and dense mountain." Whom do they wish to represent as coming from the south? If they say that it is the Almighty God the Father, then God the Father comes from a place-- from which place, moreover, He is thus excluded, and He is bounded within the straitnesses of some abode. And thus by such as these, as we have said, the sacrilegious heresy of Sabellius is embodied. . . . But if in Bethlehem, the region of which local division looks towards the southern portion of heaven, Christ is born, who by the Scriptures is also said to be God, this God is rightly described as coming from the south, because He was foreseen as about to come from Bethlehem.   106409   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 12.

{Rev 19:13; Ps 45:1; Jn 1:3; Col 1:16; Jn 1:1}
For, moreover, "His name is called the Word of God," and not without reason. "My heart has emitted a good Word." . . . which word He subsequently calls by the name of the King inferentially, "I will tell my works to the King." For "by Him were made all the works, and without Him was nothing made." "Whether," says the apostle, "they be thrones or dominations, or powers, or mights, visible things and invisible, all things subsist by Him."   . . . Moreover, this Word "was in the beginning with God, and God was the Word."   106423   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 13.

{Ps 19:5-6; Jn 3:13; Jn 17:5; Father and Son}
For He it is who "as a bridegroom goes forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return unto the ends of it." Because, even to the highest, "not anyone has ascended into heaven save He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven." Repeating this same thing, He says: "Father, glorify me with that glory wherewith I was with You before the world was."   106427   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 13.

{Rom 2:16; Heb 4:12-13; Jn 10:30; Jn 20:28; Rom 9:5; Gal 1:1; Christ, Deity of}
Moreover, if, whereas it is the property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins; and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, "I and the Father are one," Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ's divinity, says in reply to Christ, "My Lord and my God;" and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, "Whose are the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forevermore," writing in his epistles. . . . And if the same apostle declares that he was ordained "an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ;" and if the same contends that he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably Christ is God.   106440   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 13.

{Jn 1:3; Col 1:16; Heb 1:2; Christ, Deity of}
since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him.   106442   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 13.
{Christ, Deity of; Col 1:16}
If Christ be only man, how are "visible things and invisible, thrones, powers, and dominions," said to be created by Him? . . . How is He present wherever He is called upon; when it is not the nature of man, but of God, that it can be present in every place? If Christ is only man, why is a man invoked in prayers as a Mediator, when the invocation of a man to afford salvation is condemned as ineffectual?   106460   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 14.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 1:15; Jn 5:19; Jn 5:26}
If Christ is only man, how comes John the Baptist to testify and say, "He who comes after me has become before me, because He was prior to me;" . . . If Christ is only man, how is it that "what things the Father does, these also does the Son likewise," when man cannot do works like to the heavenly operations of God?   . . . If Christ is only man, how is it that "even as the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself,"   106467   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 14.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 6:51}
If Christ is only man, how does He say, "I am the bread of eternal life which came down from heaven," when man can neither be the bread of life, he himself being mortal, nor could he have come down from heaven, since no perishable material is established in heaven?   106469   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 14.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 1:18}
If Christ is only man, how does He say that "no man has seen God at any time, save He which is of God; He has seen God?" Because if Christ is only man, He could not see God,   106471   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 14.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 8:42; Father and Son}
If Christ is man only, how does He say, "I proceeded forth and came from God," when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him?  . . . Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded is God, who proceeded forth from God.   106504   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 15.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 8:58; Jn 10:30; Jn 10:35-36; Father and Son}
If Christ was only man, how did He say, "Before Abraham was, I am?" For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor can it be that anyone should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin. And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either, therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that He was of Abraham. Or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham.  . . . If Christ is only man, what is that which He says, "I and the Father are one?" For how can it be that "I and the Father are one," if He is not both God and the Son?  . . . which when the Jews thought to be hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures. "If," said He, "He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures cannot be broken, you  say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, you blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God." By which words He did not deny Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact. For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested many good works from the Father;  . . . And in the latter portion of His defense He made mention of the Son, not the Father, when He said, " you  say, you blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God." Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son, not the Father. . . . But as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, "I and the Father are one," He proved that He was the Son of God. He is God, therefore, but God in such a manner as to be the Son, not the Father.   106531   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 15.

{Trinity; Jn 16:13-14}
the Paraclete has received from Christ what He may declare. But if He has received from Christ what He may declare to us, Christ is greater than the Paraclete, because the Paraclete would not receive from Christ unless He were less than Christ. But the Paraclete being less than Christ, moreover, by this very fact proves Christ to be God, from whom He has received what He declares: so that the testimony of Christ's divinity is immense, in the Paraclete being found to be in this economy less than Christ, and taking from Him what He gives to others;   106544   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 16.

{Christ, Deity of; Jn 17:5; Jn 1:3}
If Christ was only man, how does He say, "And now glorify me with the glory which I had with You before the world was?" . . . He would not have had the glory unless He Himself had existed before, so as to be able to keep the glory. . . . For He is "the Word by which all things were made, and without which nothing was made."   106568   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 16.

{Gen 1:1-2}
Moses, moreover, introduces God commanding that there should be light at the first, that the heaven should be established, that the waters should be gathered into one place, that the dry land should appear, that the fruit should be brought forth according to its seed, that the animals should be produced, that lights should be established in heaven, and stars. He shows that none other was then present to God--by whom these works were commanded that they should be made--than He by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.   106582   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 17.

{Christ, Deity of; Gen 1:27}
God made man in the image of God; He is therefore God who made man in the image of God; therefore Christ is God:   106594   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 17.

{Father and Son; Gen 11:7; Eph 4:10; Christophany}
What if the same Moses everywhere introduces God the Father infinite and without end, not as being enclosed in any place, but as one who includes every place; nor as one who is in a place, but rather one in whom every place is, containing all things and embracing all things, so that with reason He can neither descend nor ascend, because He Himself both contains and fills all things, and yet nevertheless introduces God descending to consider the tower. . . . Whom do they pretend here to have been the God who descended to that tower, and asking to visit those men at that time? God the Father? Then thus He is enclosed in a place; and how does He embrace all things? . . . Neither, therefore, did the Father descend, as the subject itself indicates; nor did an angel command these things, as the fact shows. Then it remains that He must have descended, of whom the Apostle Paul says, "He who descended is the same who ascended above all the heavens, that He might fill all things," that is, the Son of God, the Word of God.   106607   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 17.

{Ex 33:20; Jn 1:18; 1 Tim 6:16; Christophany; Father and Son}
Behold, the same Moses tells us in another place that "God was seen of Abraham." And yet the same Moses hears from God, that "no man can see God and live." . . . For John also says, "No man has seen God at any time;" and the Apostle Paul, "Whom no man has seen, nor can see." But certainly the Scripture does not lie; therefore, truly, God was seen. Whence it may be understood that it was not the Father who was seen, seeing that He never was seen; but the Son, who has both been accustomed to descend, and to be seen because He has descended.   106614   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 18.

{Christophany; Father and Son; Gen 16:7-13; Gen 21:17-18}
Was that the Father that was seen by Hagar or not? For He is declared to be God. But far be it from us to call God the Father an angel, lest He should be subordinate to another whose angel He would be. . . . We ought to understand it to have been God the Son, who, because He is of God, is rightly called God, because He is the Son of God. But, because He is subjected to the Father, and the Announcer of the Father's will, He is declared to be the Angel of Great Counsel.   106636   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 18.

{Christophany; Father and Son; Gen 18:21}
God had come down on account of the cry of Sodom. In which place, if they will have it that the Father was seen at that time to have been received with hospitality in company with two angels, the heretics have believed the Father to be visible. But if an angel, although of the three angels one is called Lord, why, although it is not usual, is an angel called God?   . . . It was only God the Son, who also is God, who was seen by Abraham, and was believed to have been received with hospitality.   106650   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 18.

{Christophany; Father and Son; Gen 19:24}
[In the] destruction of the people of Sodom, it is declared: "Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven." . . . In the overturning of Sodom, the Lord rained fire from the Lord. And this Lord was the God seen by Abraham; and this God was the guest of Abraham. . . . It was not the Father, then, who was a guest with Abraham, but Christ.   106660

{Gen 21:17-18; Christophany; Father and Son}
The same Angel and God visits and consoles the same Hagar. . . . The voice of the lad from the place where he was." Having told that it was God who heard the voice of the infant, it adds: "And the angel of the Lord called Hagar herself out of heaven," saying that that was an angel whom it had called God, and pronouncing Him to be Lord   106664

{Gen 31:12-13; Christophany; Father and Son}
"For I have seen all that Laban has done to you. I am God, who appeared to you in the place of God, where you anointed for me there the standing stone, and there vowed a vow unto me." . . . And He who promises those things is manifested to be both God and Angel, so that reasonably there must be a distinction between Him who is called God only, and Him who is declared to be not God simply, but Angel also.   106692   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 19.

{Christophany; Father and Son; Gen 32:30}
And it adds, moreover: "And Jacob called the name of that place the Vision of God: for I have seen the Lord face to face, and my soul has been made safe." . . . This struggle was prefigured as that which should be between Christ and the sons of Jacob, which is said to be completed in the Gospel. For against this man [Christ], Jacob's people struggled, in which struggle Jacob's people was found to be the more powerful. For they gained the victory of iniquity against Christ, at that time, on account of the crime that they committed. . . . And although it was found the stronger, in respect of the condemnation of Christ, it still needs His mercy, still needs His blessing. . . . This was prefigured [in Jacob], and in the Gospel it was fulfilled between Christ and the people of Jacob-- wherein, although the people had the mastery, yet they proved to be inferior by being shown to be guilty.   106721   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 19.

{Christophany; Father and Son; Gen 48:15}
For when this very Jacob was about to bless Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, with his hands placed across on the heads of the lads, he said, "The God which fed me from my youth even unto this day, the Angel who delivered me from all evils, bless these lads." Even to such a point does he affirm the same Being to be an Angel, whom he had called God. . . . But now he defined the singular number of one person in the blessing, whence he meant it to be understood that the same person is God and Angel. But yet He cannot be received as God the Father; but as God and Angel, as Christ.   106728   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 19.


{Father and Son; Ps 82:1; Ex 7:1; Jn 3:34-35}
Further, if they who are reproved and blamed seem even for any reason to attain this name ["gods"] without blasphemy, that they should be called gods, assuredly much more shall He be esteemed God, who not only is said to have stood as God in the assembly of the gods, but moreover is revealed by the same authority of the reading as distinguishing and judging between gods. But even if they who "fall like one of the princes" are still called gods, much rather shall He be said to be God, who not only does not fall like one of the princes, but even overcomes both the author and prince of wickedness himself. And what in the world is the reason, that although they say that this name was given even to Moses, since it is said, "I have made you as a god to Pharaoh," it should be denied to Christ, who is declared to be ordained not to Pharaoh only, but to every creature, as both Lord and God? And in the former case [Moses] indeed this name is given with reserve, in the latter lavishly. In the former by measure, in the latter above all kind of measure. "For," it is said, "the Father gives not to the Son by measure, for the Father loves the Son."(Jn 3:34,35) In the former [Moses] for the time; in the latter, without reference to time. For He received the power of the divine name, both above all things and for all time. "For," it is said, "the Father giveth not to the Son by measure, for the Father loves the Son."   106754   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 20.

{Jn 10:18}
He declares, "I have power to lay down my life, and again to take it up; for this commandment I have received of my Father." Now who is it who says that He can lay down His life, or can Himself recover His life again, because He has received it of His Father?   106763   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 21.

{Col 1:15; Jn 1:1}
Christ is called "the first-born of every creature," how could He be the first-born of every creature, unless because according to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the first-born of every creature. . . . Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature.   . . . And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because He is that Word which is before every creature;   106775   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 21.

{1 Tim 2:5; Col 2:15}
For which reason He who is declared as made the "Mediator between God and man" is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man. . . . The apostle says of Christ, that "having put off the flesh, He spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself," he certainly did not without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection.   106781   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 21.

{Gen 49:11; Messianic Prophecies}
He before predicted in the blessings: "He shall wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape." If the garment in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that He had undertaken.   106791   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 21.

{Phil 2:6-9; Col 1:15; 1 Cor 15:28; Father and Son}
That passage in the apostle: "Who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name" (Phil 2:6-9) . . . "Who, although He was in the form of God," he says. If Christ had been only man, He would have been spoken of as in "the image" of God, not "in the form" of God.  . . . But neither do we read of the "form of God" in angels, except because this one is chief and royal above all--the Son of God. . . . And He is reasonably affirmed to be in the form of God, in that He Himself, being above all things, and having the divine power over every creature, is also God after the example of the Father. Yet He obtained this from His own Father, that He should be both God of all and should be Lord, and be begotten and made known from Himself as God in the form of God the Father. He then, although He was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped. For although He remembered that He was God from God the Father, He never either compared or associated Himself with God the Father, mindful that He was from His Father, and that He possessed that very thing that He is, because the Father had given it Him. . . . Moreover after the assumption of the body, besides, after the resurrection itself, He yielded all obedience to the Father, and still yields it as ever. Whence it is proved that He thought that the claim of a certain divinity would be robbery, to wit, that of equaling Himself with God the Father. Rather, on the other hand, obedient and subject to all His rule and will, He even was content to take on Him the form of a servant--that is, to become man, and the substance of flesh. . . . But if Christ is emptied in being born, in taking the form of a servant, how is He man only?   . . . And yet of this humility there is present at once an eminent reward. For He has "received a name which is above every name," which assuredly we understand to be none other than the name of God.   106824   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 22.

{Sabellianism}
For it is so far manifest that He is declared in the Scriptures to be God, that many heretics, moved by the magnitude and truth of this divinity, exaggerating His honors above measure, have dared to announce or to think Him not the Son, but God the Father Himself. And this, although it is contrary to the truth of the Scriptures, is still a great and excellent argument for the Christ, Divinity of.   106838   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 23.

{Trinity; Mt 10:28; Soul}
Therefore, say they, if Christ is not man only, but God also--and Scripture tells us that He died for us, and was raised again--then Scripture teaches us to believe that God died; or if God does not die, and Christ is said to have died, then Christ will not be God, because God cannot be admitted to have died. . . . If Christ is God, and Christ died, then God died. But when Scripture determines, as we have frequently shown, that He is not only God, but man also, it follows that what is immortal may be held to have remained uncorrupted. . . . "Fear not those who slay the body, but cannot kill the soul." But if the immortal soul cannot be killed or slain in any other, although the body and flesh by itself can be slain, how much rather assuredly could not the Word of God and God in Christ be put to death at all, although the flesh alone and the body was slain!  . . . For as the soul itself, which was made by the Word of God, is not killed by men, certainly much rather will it be believed that the Word of God cannot be destroyed. . . . Death in them does not destroy the soul, although it dissolves the bodies themselves:   106917   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 25.

{Sabellianism; Father and Son}
Other heretics [the Sabellians], breaking forth, contrive to impair the religious position in Christ-- by this very fact wishing to show that Christ is God the Father, in that He is asserted to be not man only, but also is declared to be God. . . . For thus say they, If it is asserted that God is one, and Christ is God, then say they, If the Father and Christ be one God, Christ will be called the Father. Wherein they are proved to be in error, not knowing Christ, but following the sound of a name. For they are not willing that He should be the second person after the Father, but the Father Himself. And since these things are easily answered, only a few words shall be said.   106926

Ask of me, and I will give You the heathens for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession?" Or when also that beloved writer says: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, until I shall make your enemies the stool of your feet?" Or when, unfolding the prophecies of Isaiah, he finds it written thus: "Thus says the Lord to Christ my Lord?" Or when he reads: "I came not down from heaven to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me?" Or when he finds it written: "Because He who sent me is greater than I?" Or when he considers the passage: "I go to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God?" Or when he finds it placed side by side with others: "Moreover, in your law it is written that the witness of two is true.

Or when by Christ Himself it is expressed: "Father, glorify me with that glory with which I was with You before the world was made?" Or when it was said by the same: "Father, I knew that you hear me always."   . . .  "And this is life eternal, that they should know You, the only and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have glorified You upon the earth, I have finished the work which you gave me?"  . . .

 Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 26.

{Sabellianism; Jn 10:33; Jn 10:36; Father and Son; Jn 17:18; 1 Cor 3:6-8}
[Answering the Sabellians]: But since they frequently urge upon us the passage where it is said, "I and the Father are one." . . . He severs and distinguishes the peculiarity of His, that is, the Son's person, from the paternal authority, not only in respect of the sound of the name, but moreover in respect of the order of the distribution of power, since He might have said, "I the Father," if He had had it in mind that He Himself was the Father. . . . And since He said "one" thing, let the heretics understand that He did not say "one person." For one placed in the neuter, intimates the social concord, not the personal unity. He is said to be one neuter, not one masculine, because the expression is not referred to the number, but it is declared with reference to the association of another.   . . . Finally, He adds, and says, "We are," not "I am," so as to show, by the fact of His saying "I and the Father are," that they are two persons. Moreover, that He says one, has reference to the agreement, and to the identity of judgment, and to the loving association itself. As reasonably the Father and Son are one in agreement, in love, and in affection; and because He is of the Father, whatsoever He is, He is the Son. The distinction however remains that He is not the Father who is the Son, because He is not the Son who is the Father. . . . For He would not have added "We are," if He had had it in mind that He, the only and sole Father, had become the Son.  . . . In Corinthians he said, "I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. Therefore neither is he that plants anything, nor he that waters, but God who gives the increase. Now he that plants and he that waters are one." And who does not perceive that Apollos is one person and Paul another, and that Apollos and Paul are not one and the same person? Moreover, also, the offices mentioned of each one of them are different. . . . The Apostle Paul, however, put forward these two not as being "one person," but as being "one." So that although Apollos indeed is one, and Paul another, so far as respects the distinction of persons, yet as far as respects their agreement, they both are "one."   . . . Besides, when at these words of the Lord the Jewish ignorance had been aroused, so that hastily they ran to take up stones, and said, "For a good work we stone you not, but for blasphemy; and because thou, being a man, make yourself God," the Lord established the distinction, in giving them the principle on which He had either said that He was God, or wished it to be understood, and says, "Do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?" (John 10:36) Even here also He said that He had the Father. He is therefore the Son, not the Father. For He would have confessed that He was the Father had He considered Himself to be the Father. And He declares that He was sanctified by His Father. . . . In receiving, then, sanctification from the Father, He is inferior to the Father. Now, consequently, He who is inferior to the Father, is not the Father, but the Son; for had He been the Father, He would have given, and not received, sanctification.   106979 
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 27.

. . . Besides, He says that He is sent: so that by that obedience wherewith the Lord Christ came, being sent, He might be proved to be not the Father, but the Son, who assuredly would have sent had He been the Father. But being sent, He was not the Father, lest the Father should be proved, in being sent, to be subjected to another God.   106982   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 27.

{Sabellianism; Jn 10:36}
[Against Sabellians]: "Do you say . . . You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? Therefore He plainly testifies that He is the Son of God, and not the Father.   106986   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 27.

{Sabellianism; Father and Son; Jn 14:6-9; Jn 14:12; Isa 8:3; Ps 69:21; Ps 22:18; Messianic Prophecies}
[Against Sabellians]: "Have I been so long time with you, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me, has seen the Father also." . . . He said this not as wishing to be understood Himself to be the Father. Rather He was implying that he who thoroughly, and fully, and with all faith and all religiousness, drew near to the Son of God, by all means shall attain, through the Son Himself, in whom he thus believes, to the Father, and shall see Him. "For no one," says He, "can come to the Father, but by me." . . . For often the divine Scripture announces things that are not yet done as being done, because thus they shall be; and things which by all means have to happen, it does not predict as if they were future. . . . [For example], although Mary had not yet been approached, he said, "And I approached unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son."   . . . And although not yet had He been scornfully given to drink, the Scripture says, "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." And although He had not yet been stripped, He said, "Upon my vesture they did cast lots, and they numbered my bones: they pierced my hands and my feet." For the divine Scripture, foreseeing, speaks of things which it knows shall be as being already done,   . . .
[Against Sabellians]: [It speaks of] things as perfected which it regards as future, but which shall come to pass without any doubt. And thus the Lord in the present passage said, "Henceforth you have known and have seen Him." Now He said that the Father should be seen by whomsoever had followed the Son. Not as if the Son Himself should be the Father seen, but that whosoever was willing to follow Him, and be His disciple, should obtain the reward of being able to see the Father.   . . . Just as if he saw the Father, when he sees Him who always imitates the invisible Father in all His works. But if Christ is the Father Himself, in what manner does He immediately add, and say, "Whosoever believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father?"   107014

After which also He adds this: "If anyone loves me, he shall keep my word: and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him." Moreover, also, He added this too: "But the Advocate, that Holy Spirit whom the Father will send, He will teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." He utters, further, that passage when He shows Himself to be the Son, and reasonably subjoins, and says, "If you loved me, you would rejoice because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I." . . . "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away. . . .  "As the Father has loved me, so also have I loved you." . . . "Even as I have kept the Father's commandments, and remain in His love." . . .. "But I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you."  . . .

Since the whole of the Old and New Covenants might be adduced in testimony that thus the true faith stands.   . . . Yet, heretics, ever struggling against the truth, are accustomed to prolong the controversy of pure tradition and Catholic faith--contend, concerning the fact that Christ is God also, in such a way as that it may not militate against the truth of Scripture; nor yet against our faith, how there is declared to be one God by the Scriptures, and how it is held and believed by us.   . . . Because when they perceived that it was written that "God is one," they thought that they could not otherwise hold such an opinion than by supposing that it must be believed either that Christ was man only, or really God the Father.   107108   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 30.

{Sabellianism; Father and Son}
And thus they who say that Jesus Christ is the Father argue as follows:--If God is one, and Christ is God, Christ is the Father, since God is one. . . . And they who contend that Christ is man only, conclude on the other hand thus: If the Father is one, and the Son another, but the Father is God and Christ is God, then there is not one God, but two Gods. . . . and if God is one, by consequence Christ must be a man, so that rightly the Father may be one God.   . . . Thus indeed the Lord is, as it were, crucified between two thieves, even as He was formerly placed; and thus from either side He receives the sacrilegious reproaches of such heretics as these.   107115

{Jn 1:1-2; Jn 1:14; Rom 9:5; Mk 10:18; Mt 19:17}
But even as we hold, and read, and believe this, thus we ought to pass over no portion of the heavenly Scriptures, since indeed also we ought by no means to reject those marks of Christ's divinity which are laid down in the Scriptures, that we may not, by corrupting the authority of the Scriptures, be held to have corrupted the integrity of our holy faith. And let us therefore believe this, since it is most faithful that Jesus Christ the Son of God is our Lord and God; because "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God." And, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us." And, "My Lord and my God." And, "Whose are the fathers, and of whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forevermore." What, then, shall we say? Does Scripture set before us two Gods? How, then, does it say that "God is one?"  . . . And Christ is called the "one Master." Nevertheless we read that the Apostle Paul also is a master. Then, according to this, our Master is not one, for from these things we conclude that there are two masters. . . . In the Scriptures there is one "called good, even God;" but in the same Scriptures Christ is also asserted to be good. There is not, then, if they rightly conclude, one good, but even two good. . . . Thus God the Father, the Founder and Creator of all things, who only knows no beginning, invisible, infinite, immortal, eternal, is one God; to whose greatness, or majesty, or power, I would not say nothing can be preferred, but nothing can be compared; of whom, when He willed it, the Son, the Word, was born, who is not received in the sound of the stricken air, or in the tone of voice forced from the lungs, but is acknowledged in the substance of the power put forth by God, the mysteries of whose sacred and divine nativity neither an apostle has learnt, nor prophet has discovered, nor angel has known, nor creature has apprehended. To the Son alone they are known, who has known the secrets of the Father. He then, since He was begotten of the Father, is always in the Father.  . . . But He who is before all time must be said to have been always in the Father; for no time can be assigned to Him who is before all time. . . . Only that the Father also precedes Him,--in a certain sense,--since it is necessary--in some degree--that He should be before He is Father. Because it is essential that He who knows no beginning must go before Him who has a beginning; even as He is the less as knowing that He is in Him, having an origin because He is born, and of like nature with the Father in some measure by His nativity, although He has a beginning [or origin] in that He is born, inasmuch as He is born of that Father who alone has no beginning.   107153   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 30 + 31.

{Jn 8:42; Jn 1:1-3; Col 1:15; Jn 5:37; 1 Tim 1:17; Father and Son}
He, then, when the Father willed it, proceeded from the Father, and He who was in the Father came forth from the Father; and He who was in the Father because He was of the Father, was subsequently with the Father, because He came forth from the Father,--that is to say, that divine substance whose name is the Word, whereby all things were made, and without whom nothing was made. . . . And reasonably, He is before all things, but after the Father, since all things were made by Him, and He proceeded from Him of whose will all things were made. Assuredly God proceeding from God, causing a person second to the Father as being the Son, but not taking from the Father that characteristic that He is one God.  . . . For if He had not been born--compared with Him who was unborn, an equality being manifested in both--He would make two unborn beings, and thus would make two Gods.  . . . Had He been formed without beginning as the Father, and He Himself the beginning of all things as is the Father, this would have made two beginnings, and consequently would have shown to us two Gods. . . . Had He been invisible, as compared with the Invisible, and declared equal, He would have shown forth two Invisibles, and thus also He would have proved them to be two Gods. If incomprehensible, if also whatever other attributes belong to the Father, reasonably we say, He would have given rise to the allegation of two Gods, as these people feign. But now, whatever He is, He is not of Himself, because He is not unborn; but He is of the Father, because He is begotten, whether as being the Word, whether as being the Power, or as being the Wisdom, or as being the Light, or as being the Son; and whatever of these He is, in that He is not from any other source, as we have already said before, than from the Father, owing His origin to His Father, He could not make a disagreement in the divinity by the number of two Gods, since He gathered His beginning by being born of Him who is one God.   107167   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 31.

{Trinity; Jn 5:19; Jn 5:37; 1 Cor 15:28; 1 Cor 8:6}
He [the Father] is the only one, of all things both Source and Head. And therefore He declared that God is one, in that He proved Him to be from no source nor beginning. . . . Moreover, the Son does nothing of His own will, nor does anything of His own determination; nor does He come from Himself, but obeys all His Father's commands and precepts; so that, although birth proves Him to be a Son, yet obedience even to death declares Him the minister of the will of His Father, of whom He is.   . . . Yet He shows the one God the Father by His obedience, from whom also He drew His beginning.   107178   
Novatian, On the Trinity, ch. 31.

{1 Cor 15:24-28; Father and Son}
And His divinity is thus declared, that it may not appear by any dissonance or inequality of divinity to have caused two Gods. For all things being subjected to Him as the Son by the Father, while He Himself, with those things which are subjected to Him. . . . He is indeed proved to be Son of His Father; but He is found to be both Lord and God of all else. Whence, while all things put under Him are delivered to Him who is God, and all things are subjected to Him, the Son refers all that He has received to the Father, remits again to the Father the whole authority of His divinity. The true and eternal Father is manifested as the one God.   107186

Not assuredly those sins which had been previously contracted, for those are purged by the blood and sanctification of Christ. Moreover, He says again, "As water extinguishes fire, so almsgiving quenches sin." Here also it is shown and proved, that as in the laver of saving water the fire of Gehenna is extinguished, so by almsgiving and works of righteousness the flame of sins is subdued. And because in baptism remission of sins is granted once for all, constant and ceaseless labor, following the likeness of baptism, once again bestows the mercy of God.    location 102131

Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord, You shall not build me an house to dwell in; but it shall come to pass, when your days shall be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you who shall come from your loins, and I will establish His kingdom.

In the Wisdom of Solomon: "Let us lay hold of the righteous, because He is disagreeable to us, and is contrary to our works, and reproaches us with our transgressions  . . . Also in Isaiah: "See you how the righteous perishes, and no man understands; and righteous men are taken away, and no man regards.

15. That Christ is called a sheep and a lamb who was to be slain, and concerning the sacrament (mystery) of the passion.
In Isaiah: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away: who shall relate His nativity? Because His life shall be taken away from the earth. By the transgressions of my people He was led to death; and I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich themselves for His death; because He did no wickedness, nor deceits with His mouth. Wherefore He shall gain many, and shall divide the spoils of the strong; because His soul was delivered up to death, and He was counted among transgressors. And He bare the sins of many, and was delivered for their offences." Also in Jeremiah: "Lord, give me knowledge, and I shall know it: then I saw their mations. I was led like a lamb without malice to the slaughter; against me they devised a device, saying, Come, let us cast the tree into His bread, and let us erase His life from the earth, and His name shall no more be a remembrance."    location 103726

16. That Christ also is called a Stone.    
Also in Zechariah: "Behold, I bring forth my servant. The Orient is his name, because the stone which I have placed before the face of Jesus; upon that one stone are seven eyes." Also in Deuteronomy: "And you shall write upon the stone all this law, very plainly." Also in Jesus the son of Nave: "And he took a great stone, and placed it there before the Lord; and Jesus said unto the people, Behold, this stone shall be to you for a testimony, because it has heard all the things which were spoken by the Lord, which He has spoken to you to-day; and it shall be for a testimony to you in the last of the days, when you shall have departed from your God."    . . .
This is the stone in Genesis, which Jacob places at his head, because the head of the man is Christ;    . . . This is the stone in Exodus upon which Moses sate on the top of a hill when Jesus the son of Nave fought against Amalek; and by the sacrament of the stone, and the steadfastness of his sitting, Amalek    
. . ..
This is the great stone in the first book of Kings, upon which was placed the ark of the covenant when the oxen brought it back in the cart, sent back and returned by the strangers.    . . . Also, this is the stone in the first book of Kings, with which David smote the forehead of Goliath and slew him; signifying that the devil and his servants are thereby thrown down--that part of the head, namely, being conquered which they have not had sealed. And by this seal we also are always safe and live. This is the stone which, when Israel had conquered the aliens, Samuel set up and called its name Ebenezer; that is, the stone that helps.    location 103761

For from Sion shall proceed the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; and He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke much people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks, and they shall no more learn to fight." Also in the twenty-third Psalm: "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place? He that is innocent in his hands, and of a clean heart; who has not received his life in vanity, and has not sworn craftily to his neighbor.

19. That Christ is the Bridegroom, having the Church as His bride, from which spiritual children were to be born. In Joel: "Blow with the trumpet in Sion; sanctify a fast, and call a healing; assemble the people, sanctify the Church, gather the elders, collect the little ones that suck the breast; let the Bridegroom go forth of His chamber, and the bride out of her closet."  . . . Also in Jeremiah: "And I will take away from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of the joyous, and the voice of the glad; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride." Also in the eighteenth Psalm: "And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he exulted as a giant to run his course. From the height of heaven is his going forth, and his circuit even to the end of it; and there is nothing which is hid from his heat." Also in the Apocalypse: "Come, I will show you the new bride,    
. . . Also in the Gospel according to John: "You are my witnesses, that I said to them who were sent from Jerusalem to me, that I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him. For he who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom is he who stands and hears him with joy, and rejoices because of the voice of the bridegroom."    location 103788

20. That the Jews would fasten Christ to the cross. In Isaiah: "I have spread out my hands all day to a people disobedient and contradicting me, who walk in ways that are not good, but after their own sins." Also in Jeremiah: "Come, let us cast the tree into His bread, and let us blot out His life from the earth." Also in Deuteronomy: "And your life shall be hanging (in doubt) before your eyes; and You shall fear day and night, and shall not trust to your life." Also in the twenty-first Psalm: "They tore my hands and my feet; they numbered all my bones. And they gazed upon me, and saw me, and divided my garments among them, and upon my vesture they cast a lot.  . . . 
Also in the 118th Psalm: "Pierce my flesh with nails through fear of You." Also in the 140th Psalm: "The lifting up of my hands is an evening sacrifice." Of which sacrifice Sophonias said: "Fear from the presence of the Lord God, since His day is near, because the Lord has prepared His sacrifice, He has sanctified His elect." Also in Zechariah: "And they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced." Also in the eighty-seventh Psalm: "I have called unto You, O Lord, the whole day; I have stretched out my hands unto You."

In Ezekiel the Lord says: "Pass through the midst of Jerusalem, and you shall mark the sign upon the men's foreheads, who groan and grieve for the iniquities which are done in the midst of them." Also in the same place: "Go and smite, and do not spare your eyes. Have no pity on the old man, and the youth, and the virgin, and slay little children and women, that they may be utterly destroyed. But you shall not touch anyone upon whom the sign is written, and begin with my holy places themselves."  . . . Also in the Apocalypse: "And I saw a Lamb standing on Mount Sion, and with Him a hundred and forty and four thousand; and they had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."  Also in the same place: "I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

In Amos: "And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, the sun shall set at noonday, and the day of light shall be darkened; and I will turn your feast-days into grief, and all your songs into lamentation." Also in Jeremiah: "She is frightened that has borne children, and her soul has grown weary.

26. That after He had risen again He should receive from His Father all power, and His power should be everlasting. In Daniel: "I saw in a vision by night, and behold as it were the Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven, came even to the Ancient of days, and stood in His sight. . . . and to Him was given a royal power, and all the kings of the earth by their generation, and all glory obeying Him: and His power is eternal, which shall not be taken away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed." 
Also in Isaiah: "Now will I arise, says the Lord; now will I be glorified, now will I be exalted, now you shall see, now you shall understand, now you shall be confounded.    Also in the 109th Psalm: "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit You on my right hand, until I make
Your enemies the footstool of Your feet. God will send the rod of Your power out of Sion, and You shall rule in the midst of Your enemies."4098 Also in the Apocalypse: "And I turned and looked to see the voice which spoke with me. And I saw seven golden candlesticks, and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a long garment,4099 and He was girt about the paps with a golden girdle. And His head and His hairs were white as wool or snow, and His eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like to fine brass from a furnace of fire, and His voice like the sound of many waters. And He had in His right hand seven stars: and out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun in his might. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, and said, Fear not; I am the first and the last, and He that liveth and was dead; and, lo, I am living forevermore4100 and I have the keys of death and of hell."4101 Likewise in the Gospel, the Lord after His resurrection says to His disciples: "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you."4102

Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord strong in battle. Lift up your gates, O you princes; and be you lifted up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory."4125 Also in the forty-fourth Psalm: "My heart has breathed forth a good discourse:4126 I tell my works to the king: my tongue is the pen of a writer intelligently writing. You are lovely in beauty above the children of men: grace is shed forth on Your lips, because God has blessed You forever. Be girt with Your sword on Your thigh, O most mighty. To Your honor and to Your beauty both attend, and direct Yourself, and reign, because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness."4127 Also in the fifth Psalm: "My King, and my God, because unto You will I pray.

And out of His mouth went forth a sword with two edges, that with it He should smite the nations, which He shall shepherd4135 with a rod of iron; and He shall tread the winepress of the wrath of God Almighty.

{Free will}
I. God did not make evil, nor is He at all in anyway the author of evil. But whoever failed to keep the law that He in all justice ordained—after being made by Him with the faculty of freewill—for the purpose of guarding and keeping it, is called evil. Now it is the gravest fault to disobey God, by overstepping the bounds of that righteousness which is consistent with free-will.    location 118853

I cannot endure the trifling of some who shamelessly do violence to Scripture, in order that their opinion, that the resurrection is without flesh, may find support;    location 118859   
Methodius, On the Resurrection, Part I.

{Gen 3:19-21}
God for this cause pronounced him mortal, and clothed him with mortality. For this is what was meant by the coats of skins, in order that, by the dissolution of the body, sin might be altogether destroyed from the very roots, that there might not be left even the smallest particle of root from which new shoots of sin might again burst forth.    location 118869   
Methodius, On the Resurrection, Part I.

{Gen 3:19; Baptism; Heb 12:15; Post-baptismal Sin}
[Analogy to mortality of man] V. For as a fig-tree, which has grown in the splendid buildings of a temple, and has reached a great size, and is spread over all the joints of the stones with thickly-branching roots, ceases not to grow, till, by the loosening of the stones from the place in which it sprung up, it is altogether torn away; for it is possible for the stones to be fitted into their own places, when the fig tree is taken away, so that the temple may be preserved, having no longer to support what was the cause of its own destruction; while the fig-tree, torn away by the roots, dies;    location 118871   
Methodius, On the Resurrection, Part I, ch.V.
For while the body still lives, before it has passed through death, sin must also live with it, as it has its roots concealed within us even though it be externally checked by the wounds inflicted by corrections and warnings; since, otherwise, it would not happen that we do wrong after baptism, as we should be entirely and absolutely free from sin. But now, even after believing, and after the time of being touched by the water of sanctification, we are oftentimes found in sin.    location 118878   
Methodius, On the Resurrection, Part I, ch V?.
So that it is come to pass that sin is now restrained and lulled to sleep by faith, so that it does not produce injurious fruits, but yet is not torn up by the roots. For the present we restrain its sprouts, such as evil imaginations, "lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble" us, not suffering its leaves to unclose and open into shoots; while the Word, like an axe, cuts at its roots which grow below. But hereafter the very thought of evil will disappear.    location 118882

{Gen 3:19; Resurrection Analogy; Jer 18:3-6}
It appears, then, as if an eminent craftsman were to cast over again a noble image, wrought by himself of gold or other material, and beautifully proportioned in all its members, upon his suddenly perceiving that it had been mutilated by some infamous man, who, too envious to endure the image being beautiful, spoiled it, and thus enjoyed the empty pleasure of indulged jealousy. For take notice, most wise Aglaophon, that, if the artificer wish that that upon which he has bestowed so much pains and care and labor, shall be quite free from injury, he will be impelled to melt it down, and restore it to its former condition. But if he should not cast it afresh, nor reconstruct it, but allow it to remain as it is, repairing and restoring it, it must be that the image, being passed through the fire and forged, cannot any longer be preserved unchanged, but will be altered and wasted. Wherefore, if he should wish it to be perfectly beautiful and faultless, it must be broken up and recast, in order that all the disfigurements and mutilations inflicted upon it by treachery and envy, may be got rid of by the breaking up and recasting of it, while the image is restored again uninjured and unalloyed to the same form as before, and made as like itself as possible.    location 118887   
Now God's plan seems to me to have been the same as that which prevails among ourselves. For seeing man, His fairest work, corrupted by envious treachery, He could not endure, with His love for man, to leave him in such a condition, lest he should be forever faulty, and bear the blame to eternity; but dissolved him again into his original materials, in order that, by remodelling, all the blemishes in him might waste away and disappear.    location 118898

VIII. But it is not satisfactory to say that the universe will be utterly destroyed, and sea and air and sky will be no longer. For the whole world will be deluged with fire from heaven, and burnt for the purpose of purification and renewal; it will not, however, come to complete ruin and corruption. For if it were better for the world not to be than to be, why did God, in making the world, take the worse course? But God did not work in vain, or do that which was worst.    location 118909   
also the Book of Wisdom confirms, saying, "For God created all things that they might have their being; and the generations of the world were healthful, and there is no poison of destruction in them." And Paul clearly testifies this, saying, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that subjected the same in hope: because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God."    location 118913

For in reality God did not establish the universe in vain, or to no purpose but destruction, as those weak-minded men say, but to exist, and be inhabited, and continue.

IX. But if our opponents say, How then is it, if the universe be not destroyed, that the Lord says that "heaven and earth shall pass away;" and the prophet, that "the heaven shall perish as smoke, and the earth shall grow old as a garment;" we answer, because it is usual for the Scriptures to call the change of the world from its present condition to a better and more glorious one, destruction; as its earlier form is lost in the change of all things to a state of greater splendor; for there is no contradiction nor absurdity in the Holy Scriptures. For not "the world" but the "fashion of this world" passes away, it is said; so it is usual for the Scriptures to call the change from an earlier form to a better and more comely state, destruction; just as when one calls by the name of destruction the change from a childish form into a perfect man, as the stature of the child is turned into manly size and beauty.    location 118927

But you overlooked this, my excellent friend, that He who created and set in order the universe out of nothing, ordained the nature of immortal beings to be distributed not only among angels and ministers, but also among principalities, and thrones, and powers. For the race of angels is one, and that of principalities and powers another; because immortal beings are not all of one order, and constitution, and tribe, and family, but there are differences of race and tribe. And neither do the cherubim, departing from their own nature, assume the form of angels; nor, again, do angels assume the form of the others. For they cannot be anything but what they are and have been made. Moreover, man also having been appointed by the original order of things to inhabit the world, and to rule over all that is in it, when he is immortal, will never be changed from being a man into the form either of angels or any other; for neither do angels undergo a change from their original form to another. For Christ at His coming did not proclaim that the human nature should, when it is immortal, be remolded or transformed into another nature, but into what it was before the fall.    location 118942   
that none may be wanting to any, but all may be full: heaven of angels, thrones of powers, luminaries of ministers; and the more divine spots, and the undefiled and untainted luminaries, with seraphim, who attend the Supreme Council, and uphold the universe; and the world of men.

But the Son of God does nothing superfluously. He did not then take the form of a servant uselessly, but to raise it up and save it.

Was it that we may keep a feast to God, as the Jews with their low view of the Scriptures interpret it? as if God took pleasure in such tabernacles, decked out with fruits and boughs and leaves, which immediately wither and lose their verdure. We cannot say so. Tell me, then, what was the object of the Feast of Tabernacles? It was introduced to point to this real tabernacle of ours, which, after it was fallen down to corruption through the transgression of the law, and broken up by sin, God promised to put together again, and to raise up in incorruptibility, in order that we may truly celebrate in His honor the great and renowned Feast of Tabernacles at the resurrection; when our tabernacles are put together in the perfect order of immortality and harmony, and raised up from the dust in incorruption; when the dry bones, according to the most true prophecy, shall hear a voice, and be brought to their joints by God, the Creator and Perfect Artificer, who will then renew the flesh and bind it on,    location 119013

{Evil, Problem of; Free Will}
But if you say that evil is neither of the things supposed, but is the doing of something evil, you declare that it has an origin. For the doing of a thing makes the beginning of its existence.  … Now, it has been already shown that he who acts is not evil according to his being, but in accordance with his evil doing. Because there is nothing evil by nature, but it is by use that evil things become such. So I say, says he, that man was made with a free-will, not as if there were already evil in existence, which he had the power of choosing if he wished, but on account of his capacity of obeying or disobeying God.    location 118817

For it is plain that some gave up their property, and altogether abandoned the pursuit of pleasures, that, being disengaged and without impediment, they might follow the simple truth, and it alone. And so greatly did the name and authority of the truth prevail with them, that they proclaimed that the reward of the greatest good was contained in it. But they did not obtain the object of their wish, and at the same time lost their labor and industry; because the truth, that is the secret of the Most High God, who created all things, cannot be attained by our own ability and perceptions.

And they who hold that there are many gods, do indeed effect this; for those gods must of necessity be weak, since individually, without the aid of the others, they would be unable to sustain the government of so vast a mass. But God, who is the Eternal Mind, is undoubtedly of excellence, complete and perfect in every part. And if this is true, He must of necessity be one.    … Why should I mention that this highest power and divine energy is altogether incapable of division? For whatever is capable of division must of necessity be liable to destruction also.    … since some desired that Troy should be taken, others opposed it. The universe, therefore, must be ruled by the will of one. For unless the power over the separate parts be referred to one and the same providence, the whole itself will not be able to exist; since each takes care of nothing beyond that which belongs peculiarly to him, just as warfare could not be carried on without one general and commander.    location 125099

let us cite as witnesses those very persons whom they are accustomed to make use of against us,--I mean poets and philosophers. From these we cannot fail in proving the unity of God; not that they had ascertained the truth, but that the force of the truth itself is so great, that no one can be so blind as not to see the divine brightness presenting itself to his eyes.    … The poets, therefore, however much they adorned the gods in their poems, and amplified their exploits with the highest praises, yet very frequently confess that all things are held together and governed by one spirit or mind.  … Orpheus, who is the most ancient of the poets, and coeval with the gods themselves,--since it is reported that he sailed among the Argonauts together with the sons of Tyndarus and Hercules,--speaks of the true and great God as the first-born, because nothing was produced before Him, but all things sprung from Him. … And since he was unable to conceive in his mind the origin and nature of this Being, he said that He was born from the boundless air:    location 125143

Let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is of greater weight, and their judgment more to be relied on,  … Chrysippus speaks of God as a natural power endowed with divine reason, and sometimes as a divine necessity. Zeno also speaks of Him as a divine and natural law. The opinion of all these, however uncertain it is, has reference to one point,--to their agreement in the existence of one providence.    … Aristotle, although he is at variance with himself, and both utters and holds sentiments opposed to one another, yet upon the whole bears witness that one Mind presides over the universe. Plato, who is judged the wisest of all, plainly and openly maintains the rule of one God; nor does he name Him Ether, or Reason, or Nature, but, as He truly is, God,    … And Cicero, following and imitating him in many instances, frequently acknowledges God, and calls Him supreme, in those books which he wrote on the subject of laws;  … How often, also, does Annaeus Seneca, who was the keenest Stoic of the Romans, follow up with deserved praise the supreme Deity!    location 125191

And that no one might inquire His name, he said that He was without name,    … "God is one, but He who is one only does not need a name; for He who is self-existent is without a name."

{Rom 1:19-21; Pagan Gods; Cicero}
Afterwards the kings themselves, since they were beloved by those whose life they had civilized, after their death left regret of themselves. Therefore men formed images of them, that they might derive some consolation from the contemplation of their likenesses; and proceeding further through love of their worth, they began to reverence the memory of the deceased, that they might appear to be grateful for their services, and might attract their successors to a desire of ruling well. And this Cicero teaches in his treatise on the Nature of the Gods, saying "But the life of men and common intercourse led to the exalting to heaven by fame and goodwill men who were distinguished by their benefits. On this account Hercules, on this Castor and Pollux, AEsculapius and Liber" were ranked with the gods.    … But separate people privately honored the founders of their nation or city with the highest veneration, whether they were men distinguished for bravery, or women admirable for chastity; as the Egyptians honored Isis, the Moors Juba, the Macedonians Cabirus, the Carthaginians Uranus, the Latins Faunus, the Sabines Sancus, the Romans Quirinus. In the same manner truly Athens worshipped Minerva, Samos Juno, Paphos Venus, Lemnos Vulcan, Naxos Liber, and Delos Apollo. And thus various sacred rites have been undertaken among different peoples and countries, inasmuch as men desire to show gratitude to their princes, and cannot find out other honors which they may confer upon the dead. Moreover, the piety of their successors contributed in a great degree to the error; for, in order that they might appear to be born from a divine origin, they paid divine honors to their parents, and ordered that they should be paid by others.    location 125651

First of all, it has never happened that the worshipper of these has also been a worshipper of God. Nor can this possibly happen.

Among the people of Cyprus, Teucer sacrificed a human victim to Jupiter, and handed down to posterity that sacrifice which was lately abolished by Hadrian when he was emperor. There was a law among the people of Tauris, a fierce and inhuman nation, by which it was ordered that strangers should be sacrificed to Diana; and this sacrifice was practiced through many ages.  … For I cannot find language to speak of the infants who were immolated to the same Saturn, on account of his hatred of Jupiter. To think that men were so barbarous, so savage, that they gave the name of sacrifice to the slaughter of their own children, that is, to a deed foul, and to be held in detestation by the human race; since, without any regard to parental affection, they destroyed tender and innocent lives, at an age which is especially pleasing to parents, and surpassed in brutality the savageness of all beasts, which--savage as they are--still love their offspring!    location 125949

But since we often see that the worshippers of other gods themselves confess and acknowledge the Supreme God, what pardon can they hope for their impiety, who do not acknowledge the worship of Him whom man cannot altogether be ignorant of? For both in swearing, and in expressing a wish, and in giving thanks, they do not name Jupiter, or a number of gods, but God; so entirely does the truth of its own accord break forth by the force of nature even from unwilling breasts.    … if a violent tempest or hail shall have assailed them, they betake themselves to God, aid is implored from God, God is entreated to succour them. If anyone is tossed about on the sea, the wind being furious, it is this God whom he invokes.   … If anyone, reduced to the last extremity of poverty, begs for food, he appeals to God alone, and by His divine and matchless name alone he seeks to gain the compassion of men.

For since other animals look down to the ground, with bodies bending forward, because they have not received reason and wisdom, whereas an upright position and an elevated countenance have been given to us by the Creator God, it is evident that these ceremonies paid to the gods are not in accordance with the reason of man, because they bend down the heaven-sprung being to the worship of earthly objects.  … As an ingenious poet has well represented it:-- "And when other animals bend forward and look to the earth, He gave to man an elevated countenance, and commanded him to look up to the heaven, and to raise his countenance erect to stars."    … From this circumstance the Greeks plainly derived the name anthropos, because he looks upward.    location 126158

to fear the things which they have formed? But, they say, we do not fear the images themselves, but those beings after whose likeness they were formed, and to whose names they are dedicated. You fear them doubtless on this account, because you think that they are in heaven; for if they are gods, the case cannot be otherwise. Why, then, do you not raise your eyes to heaven, and, invoking their names, offer sacrifices in the open air? Why do you look to walls, and wood, and stone,    … it follows that images are superfluous, since the gods are present everywhere, and it is sufficient to invoke with prayer the names of those who hear us.    location 126180

But what does it avail thus to address the vulgar and ignorant, when we see that learned and prudent men, though they understand the vanity of these ceremonies, nevertheless through some perverseness persist in the worship of those very objects which they condemn? Cicero was well aware that the deities which men worshipped were false. For when he had spoken many things which tended to the overthrow of religious ceremonies, he said nevertheless that these matters ought not to be discussed by the vulgar, lest such discussion should extinguish the system of religion which was publicly received. What can you do respecting him, who, when he perceives himself to be in error, of his own accord dashes himself against the stones, that all the people may stumble?    … But this latter class, in proportion to their superior wisdom, in that they understood the error of false religion, rendered themselves so much the more foolish, because they did not imagine that some religion was true.    … But (as I have said) pardon may be granted to those who are ignorant and do not own themselves to be wise; but it cannot be extended to those who, while they profess wisdom, rather exhibit folly. … It is a well-known saying of Cicero: "I wish that I could as easily find out the truth as I can refute false things."    location 126280

{Begetting of the Son; Satan; Ezek 28:14-15; Father and Son}
Since God was possessed of the greatest foresight for planning, and of the greatest skill for carrying out in action, before He commenced this business of the world,--inasmuch as there was in Him, and always is, the fountain of full and most complete goodness,--in order that goodness might spring as a stream from Him, and might flow forth afar, He produced a Spirit like to Himself, who might be endowed with the perfections of God the Father. But how He willed that, I will endeavor to show in the fourth book. Then He made another being, in whom the disposition of the divine origin did not remain. Therefore he was infected with his own envy as with poison, and passed from good to evil; and at his own will, which had been given to him by God unfettered, he acquired for himself a contrary name.    … which it appears that the source of all evils is envy. For he envied his predecessor, who through his steadfastness is acceptable and dear to God the Father.   …
This being, who from good became evil by his own act, is called by the Greeks diabolus: we call him accuser, because he reports to God the faults to which he himself entices us.    location 126566

In short, when God revealed the truth to man, He wished us only to know those things which it concerned man to know for the attainment of life; but as to the things which related to a profane and eager curiosity He was silent, that they might be secret.

He also established two parts of the earth itself opposite to one another, and of a different character,--namely, the east and the west;   … and of these the east is assigned to God, because He Himself is the fountain of light, and the enlightener of all things, and because He makes us rise to eternal life. But the west is ascribed to that disturbed and depraved mind, because it conceals the light, because it always brings on darkness, and because it makes men die and perish in their sins. For as light belongs to the east, and the whole course of life depends upon the light, so darkness belongs to the west: but death and destruction are contained in darkness.  … For as darkness is opposed to light, so is cold to heat. As, therefore, heat is nearest to light, so is the south to the east; and as cold is nearest to darkness, so is the northern region to the west. And He assigned to each of these parts its own time,--namely, the spring to the east, the summer to the southern region, the autumn belongs to the west, and the winter to the north.    location 126718

The substance of fire is heat; of water, moisture. Rightly therefore does Ovid say:-- "For when moisture and heat have become mingled, they conceive, and all things arise from these two. And though fire is at variance with water, moist vapor produces all things, and discordant concord is adapted to production." For the one element is, as it were, masculine; the other, as it were, feminine: the one active, the other passive. And on this account it was appointed by the ancients that marriage contracts should be ratified by the solemnity of fire and water, because the young of animals are furnished with a body by heat and moisture, and are thus animated to life.    … For, since every animal consists of soul and body, the material of the body is contained in moisture, that of the soul in heat:    … Of such importance were these two elements considered, that they believed them to be essential for the production of man, and for the sustaining of his life. One of these is common to us with the other animals, the other has been assigned to man alone.    location 126750

It is agreed by all that the deluge took place for the destruction of wickedness, and for its removal from the earth. Now, both philosophers and poets, and writers of ancient history, assert the same, and in this they especially agree with the language of the prophets.   … how was Prometheus the maker of man, when his son Deucalion is said by the same writers to have been the only one who was preserved on account of his righteousness? How could a single descent and a single generation have so quickly filled the world with men? But it is plain that they have corrupted this also, as they did the former account; since they were ignorant both at what time the flood happened on the earth, and who it was that deserved on account of his righteousness to be saved when the human race perished, and how and with whom he was saved:    location 126779

but that first of all Prometheus made the image of a man of rich and soft clay, and that he first originated the art of making statues and images; inasmuch as he lived in the times of Jupiter, during which temples began to be built, and new modes of worshipping the gods introduced. And thus the truth was corrupted by falsehood; and that which was said to have been made by God began also to be ascribed to man, who imitated the divine work.    location 126786

But, they say, at the beginning of the world there was no winter nor summer, but a perpetual spring of an equable temperature. Why, then, do we see that none of these things now happens? Because, they say, it was necessary that it should once happen, that animals might be born; but after they began to exist, and the power of generation was given to them, the earth ceased to bring forth, and the condition of time was changed. Oh, how easy it is to refute falsehoods! In the first place, nothing can exist in this world which does not continue permanent, as it began.

if it is as they say, there must of necessity be a providence, and they fall into that very condition which they especially avoid.

For he consists of soul and body, that is, as it were, of heaven and earth: since the soul by which we live, has its origin, as it were, out of heaven from God, the body out of the earth, of the dust of which we have said that it was formed.  … Man, therefore, was made from different and opposite substances, as the world itself was made from light and darkness, from life and death; and he has admonished us that these two things contend against each other in man:  … so that if the soul, which has its origin from God, gains the mastery, it is immortal, and lives in perpetual light; if, on the other hand, the body shall overpower the soul, and subject it to its dominion, it is in everlasting darkness and death. And the force of this is not that it altogether annihilates the souls of the unrighteous, but subjects them to everlasting punishment.  … We term that punishment the second death, which is itself also perpetual, as also is immortality. We thus define the first death: Death is the dissolution of the nature of living beings; or thus: Death is the separation of body and soul. But we thus define the second death: Death is the suffering of eternal pain; or thus: Death is the condemnation of souls for their deserts to eternal punishments.    location 126880

But they who occupied Egypt were the first of all who began to look up to and adore the heavenly bodies. And because they did not shelter themselves in houses on account of the quality of the atmosphere, and the heaven is not overspread with any clouds in that country, they observed the courses of the stars, and their obscurations, while in their frequent adorations they more carefully and freely beheld them. Then afterwards, induced by certain prodigies, they invented monstrous figures of animals, that they might worship them;  … But the others, who were scattered over the earth, admiring the elements of the world, began to worship the heaven, the sun, the earth, the sea, without any images and temples, and offered sacrifices to them in the open air, until in process of time they erected temples and statues to the most powerful kings, and originated the practice of honoring them with victims and odours; and thus wandering from the knowledge of God, they began to be heathens.    location 126939

He plainly prohibited them from doing that which He knew that they would do, that they might entertain no hope of pardon. Therefore, while they abode among men, that most deceitful ruler of the earth, by his very association, gradually enticed them to vices, and polluted them by intercourse with women. Then, not being admitted into heaven on account of the sins into which they had plunged themselves, they fell to the earth. Thus from angels the devil makes them to become his satellites and attendants. But they who were born from these, because they were neither angels nor men, but bearing a kind of mixed nature, were not admitted into hell, as their fathers were not into heaven.

Hesiod thus speaks: "These are the demons according to the will of Zeus, Good, living on the earth, the guardians of mortal men."    … And this is said for this purpose, because God had sent them as guardians to the human race; but they themselves also, though they are the destroyers of men, yet wish themselves to appear as their guardians, that they themselves may be worshipped, and God may not be worshipped. … For Plato attempted even to explain their natures in his "Banquet;" and Socrates said that there was a demon continually about him, who had become attached to him when a boy, by whose will and direction his life was guided.

nor is there anything in the angels except the necessity of obedience. Therefore they wish no honor to be paid to them, since all their honor is in God. But they who have revolted from the service of God, because they are enemies of the truth, and betrayers of God attempt to claim for themselves the name and worship of gods;  … but that they may injure men, whom they strive to turn away from the worship and knowledge of the true Majesty, that they may not be able to obtain immortality, which they themselves have lost through their wickedness.   … But they especially deceive in the case of oracles, the juggleries of which the profane cannot distinguish from the truth;    … in short, that the state has often been freed from imminent dangers by their interposition; which dangers they have both announced, and when appeased with sacrifices, have averted. But all these things are deceits. For since they have a presentiment of the arrangements of God, inasmuch as they have been His ministers, they interpose themselves in these matters, that whatever things have been accomplished or are in the course of accomplishment by God, they themselves may especially appear to be doing or to have done;    location 127023

But now a greater and more difficult contest with philosophers is proposed to us, the height of whose learning and eloquence, as some massive structure, is opposed to me. For as in the former case we were oppressed by a multitude, and almost by the universal agreement of all nations, so in this subject we are oppressed by the authority of men excelling in every kind of praise. But who can be ignorant that there is more weight in a smaller number of learned men than in a greater number of ignorant persons?

Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras, and after him Plato, inflamed with the love of searching out the truth, had penetrated as far as to the Egyptians, and Magi, and Persians, that they might become acquainted with their religious rites and institutions (for they suspected that wisdom was concerned with religion), they did not approach the Jews only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they might have gone more easily. But I think that they were turned away from them by divine providence, that they might not know the truth, because it was not yet permitted for the religion of the true God and righteousness to become known to men of other nations. For God had determined, as the last time drew near, to send from heaven a great leader, who should reveal to foreign nations that which was taken away    location 128287

{Father, The; 1 Cor 8:6; Parents; Greek term-household; Monotheism; Polygamy; Deut 6:4; Rom 7:3}
He is to be called Father on this account, because He bestows upon us many and great things; and Lord on this account, because He has the greatest power of chastising and punishing. But that He who is Father is also Lord, is shown even by reference to civil law. For who will be able to bring up sons, unless he has the power of a lord over them? Nor without reason is he called father of a household, although he only has sons: for it is plain that the name of father embraces also slaves, because "household" follows; and the name of "household" comprises also sons, because the name of "father" precedes: from which it is evident, that the same person is both father of his slaves and lord of his sons. Lastly, the son is set at liberty as if he were a slave; and the liberated slave receives the name of his patron, as if he were a son.   … it follows that he who is a son is also a slave, and that he who is a father is also a lord. As, therefore, by the necessity of nature, there cannot be more tha person father, so there can only be one lord. For what will the slave do if many lords shall give commands at variance with each other? Therefore the worship of many gods is contrary to reason and to nature,   … Therefore there can be no true worship of many gods; just as that cannot be called matrimony, in which one woman has many husbands, but she will either be called a harlot or an adulteress.    location 128337

God, therefore, the contriver and founder of all things, as we have said in the second book, before He commenced this excellent work of the world, begat a pure and incorruptible Spirit, whom He called His Son. And although He had afterwards created by Himself innumerable other beings, whom we call angels, this first-begotten, however, was the only one whom He considered worthy of being called by the divine name, as being powerful in His Father's excellence and majesty. But that there is a Son of the Most High God, who is possessed of the greatest power, is shown not only by the unanimous utterances of the prophets, but also by the declaration of [Hermes] Trismegistus and the predictions of the Sibyls. Hermes, in the book which is entitled The Perfect Word, made use of these words: "The Lord and Creator of all things, whom we have thought right to call God, since He made the second God visible and sensible."  … And another Sibyl enjoins that He ought to be known:-- "Know Him as your God, who is the Son of God."    location 128405

who was not only begotten at first before the world, but who also arranged it by His wisdom and constructed it by His might. First of all, it is befitting that we should know that His name is not known even to the angels who dwell in heaven, but to Himself only, and to God the Father; nor will that name be published, as the sacred writings relate, before that the purpose of God shall be fulfilled.   … But although His name, which the supreme Father gave Him from the beginning, is known to none but Himself, nevertheless He has one name among the angels, and another among men, since He is called Jesus among men: for Christ is not a proper name, but a title of power and dominion; for by this the Jews were accustomed to call their kings.

The Jews had before been directed to compose a sacred oil, with which those who were called to the priesthood or to the kingdom might be anointed. And as now the robe of purple is a sign of the assumption of royal dignity among the Romans, so with them the anointing with the holy oil conferred the title and power of king. … on this account we call Him Christ, that is, the Anointed, who in Hebrew is called the Messias. Hence in some Greek writings, which are badly translated from the Hebrew, the word eleimmenos is found written, from the word aleiphesthai, anointing.

He who hears the Son of God mentioned ought not to conceive in his mind so great impiety as to think that God begat Him by marriage and union with a woman, which none does but an animal possessed of a body, and subject to death. But with whom could God unite Himself, since He is alone? or since His power was so great, that He accomplished whatever He wished, assuredly He did not require the co-operation of another for procreation. … In what manner, then, did He beget Him? First of all, divine operations cannot be known or declared by anyone; but nevertheless the sacred writings teach us, in which it is laid down that this Son of God is the speech, or even the reason of God, and also that the other angels are spirits of God. For speech is breath sent forth with a voice signifying something. But, however, since breath and speech are sent forth from different parts, inasmuch as breath proceeds from the nostrils, speech from the mouth, the difference between the Son of God and the other angels is great. For they proceeded from God as silent spirits, because they were not created to teach the knowledge of God, but for His service.    location 128447

Also in the second book of Kings, the prophet Nathan was sent to David, who wished to build a temple for God; and this was the word of the Lord to Nathan, saying: "Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, You shall not build me a house for me to dwell in; but when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, and I will establish His kingdom. He shall build me a house for my name, and I will set up His throne forever; and I will be to Him for a father, and He shall be to me for a son; and His house shall be established, and His kingdom forever." But the reason why the Jews did not understand these things was this, because Solomon the son of David built a temple for God, and the city which he called from his own name, Jerusalem. Therefore they referred the predictions of the prophets to him. Now Solomon received the government of the kingdom from his father himself. But the prophets spoke of Him who was then born after that David had slept with his fathers. Besides, the reign of Solomon was not everlasting; for he reigned forty years. In the next place, Solomon was never called the son of God, but the son of David; and the house which he built was not firmly established, as the Church, which is the true temple of God, which does not consist of walls, but of the heart and faith of the men who believe on Him, and are called faithful.

{Ps 10:3-4; 1 Sam 2:35; Zech 3:1-8; Heb 4:8; Ps 9:6; Messianic Prophecies; Jews, Unbelieving}
From which things it is evident that all the prophets declared concerning Christ, that it should come to pass at some time, that being born with a body of the race of David, He should build an eternal temple in honor of God, which is called the Church, and assemble all nations to the true worship of God. This is the faithful house, this is the everlasting temple; and if anyone has not sacrificed in this, he will not have the reward of immortality. And since Christ was the builder of this great and eternal temple, He must also have an everlasting priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the shrine of the temple, and to the sight of God, except through Him who built the temple. David in the cixth Psalm teaches the same, saying: "Before the morning-star I begat You. The Lord has sworn, and will not repent; You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec." Also in the first book of Kings: "And I will raise me up a faithful Priest, who shall do all things that are in mine heart; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk in my sight all his days." But who this was about to be, to whom God promised an everlasting priesthood, Zechariah most plainly teaches, even mentioning His name: "And the Lord God showed me Jesus the great Priest standing before the face of the angel of the Lord, and the adversary was standing at His right hand to resist Him. And the Lord said unto the adversary, The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you; and lo, a brand plucked out of the fire. And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments, and He was standing before the face of the angel. And He answered and spoke unto those that stood around before His face, saying, Take away the filthy garments from Him, and clothe Him with a flowing garment, and place a fair mitre upon His head; and they clothed Him with a garment, and placed a fair mitre upon His head. And the angel of the Lord stood, and protested, saying to Jesus: Thus says the Lord of hosts, If You will walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, You shall judge my house, and I will give You those that may walk with You in the midst of these that stand by. Hear, therefore, O Jesus, You great Priest." Who, therefore, would not believe that the Jews were then deprived of understanding, who, when they read and heard these things, laid impious hands upon their God?    location 128664

But from the time in which Zechariah lived, until the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, in which Christ was crucified, nearly five hundred years are reckoned; since he flourished in the time of Darius and Alexander, who lived not long after the banishment of Tarquinius Superbus. But they were again misled and deceived in the same manner, in supposing that these things were spoken concerning Jesus the son of Nave, who was the successor of Moses, or concerning Jesus the high priest the son of Josedech; to whom none of those things which the prophet related was suited. For they were never clothed in filthy garments, since one of them was a most powerful prince, and the other high priest; or suffered any adversity, so that they should be regarded as a brand plucked from the fire: not did they ever stand in the presence of God and the angels; nor did the prophet speak of the past so much as of the future. He spoke, therefore, of Jesus the Son of God, to show that He would first come in humility and in the flesh. For this is the filthy garment, that He might prepare a temple for God, and might be scorched as a brand with fire--that is, might endure tortures from men, and at last be extinguished. For a half-burnt brand drawn forth from the hearth and extinguished, is commonly so called. But in what manner and with what commands He was sent by God to the earth, the Spirit of God declared through the prophet, teaching us that when He had faithfully and uniformly fulfilled the will of His supreme Father, He should receive judgment and an everlasting dominion. If, He says, You will walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, then You shall judge my house. What these ways of God were, and what His precepts, is neither doubtful nor obscure.

These are the precepts which He ordered to be observed. But He exhibited faith towards God. For He taught that there is but one God, and that He alone ought to be worshipped. Nor did He at any time say that He Himself was God; for He would not have maintained His faithfullness, if, when sent to abolish the false gods, and to assert the existence of the one God, He had introduced another besides that one. This would have been not to proclaim one God, nor to do the work of Him who sent Him, but to discharge a peculiar office for Himself, and to separate Himself from Him whom He came to reveal. On which account, because He was so faithful, because He arrogated nothing at all to Himself, that He might fulfil the commands of Him who sent Him, He received the dignity of everlasting Priest, and the honor of supreme King, and the authority of Judge, and the name of God.    location 128697

{Mt 3:17; Ps 2:7; Baptism}
When He first began to reach maturity He was baptized by the prophet John in the river Jordan, that He might wash away in the spiritual laver not His own sins, for it is evident that He had none, but those of the flesh, which He bare; that as He saved the Jews by undergoing circumcision, so He might save the Gentiles also by baptism--that is, by the pouring forth of the purifying dew. Then a voice from heaven was heard: "You are my Son, to-day have I begotten You." Which voice is found to have been foretold by David.    location 128706

And again another, which says: "He shall walk on the waves, He shall release men from disease. He shall raise the dead, and drive away many pains; And from the bread of one wallet there shall be a satisfying of men." Some, refuted by these testimonies, are accustomed to have recourse to the assertion that these poems were not by the Sibyls, but made up and composed by our own writers. But he will assuredly not think this who has read Cicero, and Varro, and other ancient writers, who make mention of the Erythraean and the other Sibyls, from whose books we bring forward these examples; and these authors died before the birth of Christ  … Lastly, the Erythraean Sibyl says that it would come to pass that she would be called mad and deceitful. But assuredly "They will say that the Sibyl Is mad, and deceitful: but when all things shall come to pass, Then you will remember me; and no one will any longer Say that I, the prophetess of the great God, am mad." Therefore they were neglected for many ages; but they received attention after the nativity and passion of Christ had revealed secret things. Thus it was also with the utterances of the prophets, which were read by the people of the Jews for fifteen hundred years and more, but yet were not understood until after Christ had explained them both by His word and by His works.    location 128763

I come now to the passion itself, which is often cast in our teeth as a reproach: that we worship a man, and one who was visited and tormented with remarkable punishment: that I may show that this very passion was undergone by Him in accordance with a great and divine plan,  … For both David, in the beginning of his Psalms, foreseeing in spirit what a crime they were about to commit, says, "Blessed is the man who has not walked in the way of the ungodly; "and Solomon in the book of Wisdom used these words: "Let us defraud the righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with our offences against the law. He makes his boast that he has the knowledge of God; and he calls himself the Son of God. He is made to reprove our thoughts: it grieveth us even to look upon him: for his life is not like the life of others; his ways are of another fashion. We are counted by him as triflers, he withdraws himself from our ways as from filthiness; he commendeth greatly the latter end of the just, and boasts that he has God for his Father. Let us see, therefore, if his words be true; let us prove what end he shall have; let us examine him with rebukes and torments that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience; let us condemn him to a shameful death. Such things have they imagined, and have gone astray. For their own folly has blinded them, and they do not understand the mysteries of God." Does he not describe that impious design entered into by the wicked against God, so that he clearly appears to have been present?  … But from Solomon, who foretold these things, to the time of their accomplishment, ten hundred and ten years intervened.

Of the first David thus speaks in the seventy-first Psalm: "He shall descend as rain upon a fleece; and in His days shall righteousness spring forth, and abundance of peace, as long as the moon is lifted up." For as rain, if it descends upon a fleece, cannot be perceived, because it makes no sound; so he said that Christ would come to the earth without exciting the notice of any, that He might teach righteousness and peace. … Isaiah also thus spoke: "Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

And whoever will not hearken to those things which that Prophet shall speak in my name, I will require it of him."

Also Jesus the son of Nun, his successor, said: "And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make you knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the children of Israel the second time." He said that this second circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the Jews practice even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not say, "And the Lord said unto me," but "unto Jesus," that he might show that God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then speaking. For that Jesus represented Christ: for when he was at first called Auses, Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he should be called Jesus;    location 128838

For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational; since, if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the beginning, that he should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying that the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart. … in that circumcision He has set before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,--that is if we confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,--we shall obtain pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their faults,    location 128852

The forbidding of the flesh of swine also has the same intention; for when God commanded them to abstain from this, He willed that this should be especially understood, that they should abstain from sins and impurities. For this animal is filthy and unclean, and never looks up to heaven, but prostrates itself to the earth with its whole body and face: it is always the slave of its appetite and food; nor during its life can it afford any other service, as the other animals do, which either afford a vehicle for riding, or aid in the cultivation of the fields, or draw wagons by their neck, or carry burthens on their back, or furnish a covering with their skins, or abound with a supply of milk, or keep watch for guarding our houses. Therefore He forbade them to use the flesh of the pig for food, that is, not to imitate the life of swine,    … Also that they should not immerse themselves in foul lusts, as the sow, which wallows in the mire;    location 128862

Now, that it would come to pass that the Jews would lay hands upon their God, and put Him to death, these testimonies of the prophets foretold. In Esdras it is thus written*: "And Ezra said to the people, This Passover is our Savior and our refuge. Consider and let it come into your heart, that we have to abase Him in a figure; and after these things we will hope in Him, lest this place be deserted forever, says the Lord God of hosts. If you will not believe Him, nor hear His announcement, you shall be a derision among the nations."

And the same again in Numbers: "God is not in doubt as a man, nor does He suffer threats as the son of man." Zechariah also thus wrote: "And they shall look on me, whom they pierced." Also David in the twenty-first Psalm: "They pierced my hands and my feet; they numbered all my bones; they themselves looked and stared upon me; they divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they did cast lots."

The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited.    location 128969

Also in another place he says in like manner: "I have forsaken my house, I have given up mine heritage into the hand of its enemies. Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it has cried out against me, therefore have I hated it." Since the inheritance is His heavenly kingdom, it is evident that He does not say that He hates the inheritance itself, but the heirs, who have been ungrateful towards Him, and impious. Mine heritage, he says, is become unto me as a lion; that is, I am become a prey and a devouring to my heirs, who have slain me as the flock. It has cried out against me; that is, they have pronounced against me the sentence of death and the cross. For that which He said above, that He would make a new testament to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was given by Moses was not perfect; but that that which was to be given by Christ would be complete. But it is plain that the house of Judah does not signify the Jews, whom He casts off, but us, who have been called by Him out of the Gentiles, and have by adoption succeeded to their place, and are called sons of the Jews,    location 128973

When, therefore, we who were in time past as it were blind, and as it were shut up in the prison of folly, were sitting in darkness, ignorant of God and of the truth, we have been enlightened by Him, who adopted us by His testament; and having freed us from cruel chains, and brought us out to the light of wisdom, He admitted us to the inheritance of His heavenly kingdom.    location 128985

Therefore he answers his teacher in this manner: I am not able to do the things which you command, for they are impossible. For you forbid me to be angry, you forbid me to covet,  … Or if you are so entirely of opinion that it is possible to resist nature, do you yourself practice the things which you enjoin, that I may know that they are possible?  … wish to impose upon a free man laws which you yourself do not obey! You who teach, first learn; and before you correct the character of others, correct your own.

For if he be subject to no passion, a man may thus answer him who is the teacher: It is my wish not to sin, but I am overpowered; for I am clothed with frail and weak flesh:  … I myself perceive that I sin; but the necessity imposed by my frailty, which I am unable to resist, impels me.

You do not fear death, because it can have no power against you. You despise pain, because you can suffer no violence. But I, a mortal, fear both, because they bring upon me the severest tortures, which the weakness of the flesh cannot endure. … the teacher may answer, See, I myself do them. But I am clothed with flesh, and it is the property of flesh to sin. I too bear the same flesh, and yet sin does not bear rule in me. It is difficult for me to despise riches, because otherwise I am unable to live in this body. See, I too have a body, and yet I contend against every desire. I am not able to bear pain or death for righteousness, because I am frail. See, pain and death have power over me also; and I overcome those very things which you fear, that I may make you victorious over pain    location 129079

Why, if He was God, and chose to die, did He not at least suffer by some honorable kind of death? why was it by the cross especially? why by an infamous kind of punishment, which may appear unworthy even of a man if he is free, although guilty? First of all, because He, who had come in humility that He might bring assistance to the humble and men of low degree, and might hold out to all the hope of safety, was to suffer by that kind of punishment by which the humble and low usually suffer, that there might be no one at all who might not be able to imitate Him. In the next place, it was in order that His body might be kept unmutilated, since He must rise again from the dead on the third day.  … Thus His unbroken body was taken down from the cross, and carefully enclosed in a tomb.

For when some of their attendants who were of our religion were standing by their masters as they sacrificed, having the sign placed on their foreheads, they caused the gods of their masters to flee, that they might not be able to observe future events in the entrails of the victims. And when the soothsayers understood this, at the instigation of the same demons to whom they had sacrificed, complaining that profane men were present at the sacrifices, they drove their princes to madness, so that they attacked the temple of the god, and contaminated themselves by true sacrilege, which was expiated by the severest punishments on the part of their persecutors.    … Yes, truly, it would be consistent with their majesty to visit those whom they hated with immediate punishment, rather than to flee from them.

{Trinity; Father and Son; Begetting of the Son}
Someone may perhaps ask how, when we say that we worship one God only, we nevertheless assert that there are two, God the Father and God the Son: which assertion has driven many into the greatest error.  … When we speak of God the Father and God the Son, we do not speak of them as different, nor do we separate each: because the Father cannot exist without the Son, nor can the Son be separated from the Father, since the name of Father cannot be given without the Son, nor can the Son be begotten without the Father. Since, therefore, the Father makes the Son, and the Son the Father, they both have one mind, one spirit, one substance; but the former is as it were an overflowing fountain, the latter as a stream flowing forth from it: the former as the sun, the latter as it were a ray extended from the sun. And since He is both faithful to the Most High Father, and beloved by Him, He is not separated from Him; just as the stream is not separated from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun: for the water of the fountain is in the stream, and the light of the sun is in the ray: just as the voice cannot be separated from the mouth, nor the strength or hand from the body. When, therefore, He is also spoken of by the prophets as the hand, and strength, and word of God, there is plainly no separation; for the tongue, which is the minister of speech, and the hand, in which the strength is situated, are inseparable portions of the body.    location 129283

{Isa 45:14; Isa 44:6; Hos 13:14; Father and Son; Jn 10:37-38; Jn 12:49}
We may use an example more closely connected with us. When anyone has a son whom he especially loves, who is still in the house, and in the power of his father, although he concede to him the name and power of a master, yet by the civil law the house is one, and one person is called master. So this world is the one house of God; and the Son and the Father, who unanimously inhabit the world, are one God, for the one is as two, and the two are as one. Nor is that wonderful, since the Son is in the Father, for the Father loves the Son, and the Father is in the Son; for He faithfully obeys the will of the Father, nor does He ever do nor has done anything except what the Father either willed or commanded. Lastly, that the Father and the Son are but one God, Isaiah showed in that passage which we have brought forward before, when he said: "They shall fall down unto You, and make supplication unto You, since God is in You, and there is no other God besides You." (Isa 44:6 LXX) And he also speaks to the same purport in another place: "Thus says God the King of Israel, and His Redeemer, the everlasting God; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God." When he had set forth two persons, one of God the King, that is, Christ, and the other of God the Father, who after His passion raised Him from the dead, as we have said that the prophet Hosea showed, who said, "I will redeem Him from the power of the grave:" nevertheless, with reference to each person, he introduced the words, "and beside me there is no God," when he might have said "beside us;" but it was not right that a separation of so close a relationship should be made by the use of the plural number. For there is one God alone, free, most high, without any origin; for He Himself is the origin of all things, and in Him at once both the Son and all things are contained.    
[Note: isa 44:6 lxx] both are justly called one God; for whatever is in the Father flows on to the Son, and whatever is in the Son descends from the Father. Therefore that highest and matchless God cannot be worshipped except through the Son.    location 129305

{Catholic Church; 1 Tim 3:15}
For when they are called Phrygians, or Novatians, or Valentinians, or Marcionites, or Anthropians, or Arians, or by any other name, they have ceased to be Christians, who have lost the name of Christ, and assumed human and external names. Therefore it is the Catholic Church alone which retains true worship.   … This is the fountain of truth, this is the abode of the faith, this is the temple of God; into which if anyone shall not enter, or from which if any shall go out, he is estranged from the hope of life and eternal salvation.    location 129332

{1 Cor 1:18-21; Mt 12:25-26; Scriptures, Simple Language}
For this is especially the cause why, with the wise and the learned, and the princes of this world, the sacred Scriptures are without credit, because the prophets spoke in common and simple language, as though they spoke to the people. And therefore they are despised by those who are willing to hear or read nothing except that which is polished and eloquent; nor is anything able to remain fixed in their minds, except that which charms their ears by a more soothing sound. But those things which appear humble are considered anile, foolish, and common. So entirely do they regard nothing as true, except that which is pleasant to the ear; nothing as credible, except that which can excite pleasure: no one estimates a subject by its truth, but by its embellishment. Therefore they do not believe the sacred writings, because they are without any pretense; but they do not even believe those who explain them, because they also are either altogether ignorant, or at any rate possessed of little learning. For it very rarely happens that they are wholly eloquent; and the cause of this is evident. For eloquence is subservient to the world, it desires to display itself to the people, and to please in things which are evil; since it often endeavors to overpower the truth, that it may show its power;    location 129380

Of those who are known to me, Minucius Felix was of no ignoble rank among pleaders. His book, which bears the title of Octavius, declares how suitable a maintainer of the truth he might have been, if he had given himself altogether to that pursuit. Septimius Tertullianus also was skilled in literature of every kind; but in eloquence he had little readiness, and was not sufficiently polished, and very obscure. Not even therefore did he find sufficient renown. Cyprianus, therefore, was above all others distinguished and renowned, since he had sought great glory to himself from the profession of the art of oratory, and he wrote very many things worthy of admiration in their particular class. For he was of a turn of mind which was ready, copious, agreeable, and (that which is the greatest excellence of style) plain and open; so that you cannot determine whether he was more embellished in speech, or more ready in explanation, or more powerful in persuasion.    location 129392

When I was teaching rhetorical learning in Bithynia, having been called thither, and it had happened that at the same time the temple of God was overthrown, there were living at the same place two men who insulted the truth as it lay prostrate and overthrown, I know not whether with greater arrogance or harshness: the one of whom professed himself the high priest of philosophy; but he was so addicted to vice, that, though a teacher of abstinence, he was not less inflamed with avarice than with lusts; … He chiefly, however, assailed Paul and Peter, and the other disciples, as disseminators of deceit, whom at the same time he testified to have been unskilled and unlearned. For he says that some of them made gain by the craft of fishermen, as though he took it ill that some Aristophanes or Aristarchus did not devise that subject.    location 129444

So many robbers have at all times perished, and do perish daily, and you yourself have certainly condemned many: which of them after his crucifixion was called, I will not say a God, but a man?    … Learn, therefore, if you have any sense, that Christ was not believed by us to be God on this account, because He did wonderful things, but because we saw that all things were done in His case which were announced to us by the prediction of the prophets.

Which subject he did not handle as he ought to have done; for he ought to have been refuted not by the testimonies of Scripture, which he plainly considered vain, fictitious, and false, but by arguments and reason.    … For, since he was contending against a man who was ignorant of the truth, he ought for a while to have laid aside divine readings, and to have formed from the beginning this man as one who was altogether ignorant, and to have shown to him by degrees the beginnings of light,    location 129513

And if, through my exhortation, learned and eloquent men shall begin to betake themselves to this subject, and shall choose to display their talents and power of speaking in this field of truth, no one can doubt that false religions will quickly disappear, and philosophy altogether fall, if all shall be persuaded that this alone is religion and the only true wisdom.    location 129517

{Evil, Problem of; Free Will}
But God, as a most indulgent parent, when the last time approached, sent a messenger to bring back that old age, and justice which had been put to flight, that the human race might not be agitated by very great and perpetual errors. Therefore the appearance of that golden time returned, and justice was restored to the earth, but was assigned to a few; and this justice is nothing else than the pious and religious worship of the one God. But perhaps some may be inclined to ask, why, if this be justice, it is not given to all mankind, and the whole multitude does not agree to it. This is a matter of great disputation, why a difference was retained by God when He gave justice to the earth; and this I have shown in another place, and whenever a favorable opportunity shall occur it shall be explained. Now it is sufficient very briefly to signify it: that virtue can neither be discerned, unless it has vices opposed to it; nor be perfect, unless it is exercised by adversity. For God designed that there should be this distinction between good and evil things, that we may know from that which is evil the quality of the good, and also the quality of the evil from the good; nor can the nature of the one be understood if the other is taken away. God therefore did not exclude evil, that the nature of virtue might be evident. For how could patient endurance retain its meaning and name if there were nothing which we were compelled to endure? How could faith devoted to its God deserve praise, unless there were someone who wished to turn us away from God? For on this account He permitted the unjust to be more powerful, that they might be able to compel to evil; and on this account to be more numerous, that virtue might be precious, because it is rare.    location 129597

Be just and good, and the justice which you seek will follow you of her own accord.

But you long for justice on the earth, while the worship of false gods continues, which cannot possibly come to pass.  … But if God only were worshipped, there would not be dissensions and wars, since men would know that they are the sons of one God; and, therefore, among those who were connected by the sacred and inviolable bond of divine relationship, there would be no plottings, inasmuch as they would know what kind of punishments God prepared for the destroyers of souls, who sees through secret crimes, and even the very thoughts themselves. There would be no frauds or plunderings if they had learned, through the instruction of God, to be content with that which was their own, though little, so that they might prefer solid and eternal things to those which are frail and perishable. There would be no adulteries, and debaucheries, and prostitution of women, if it were known to all, that whatever is sought beyond the desire of procreation is condemned by God. Nor would necessity compel a woman to dishonor her modesty, to seek for herself a most disgraceful mode of sustenance; since the males also would restrain their lust, and the pious and religious contributions of the rich would succour the destitute. There would not, therefore, as I have said, be these evils on the earth, if there were by common consent a general observance of the law of God,    location 129633

If boys, if youths are improvident through their age, the mature and aged doubtless have a fixed judgment. If one city is unwise, it is evident that the other innumerable cities cannot be foolish.  … But since the divine law has been received from the rising even to the setting of the sun, and each sex, every age, and nation, and country, with one and the same mind obeys God--since there is everywhere the same patient endurance, the same contempt of death--they ought to have understood that there is some reason in that matter, that it is not without a cause that it is defended even to death,    location 129839

For when the people see that men are lacerated by various kinds of tortures, and that they retain their patience unsubdued while the executioners are wearied, they think, as is really the case, that neither the agreement of so many nor the constancy of the dying is without meaning, and that patience itself could not surmount such great tortures without the aid of God. Robbers and men of robust frame are unable to endure lacerations of this kind: they utter exclamations, and send forth groans; … But in our case (not to speak of men), boys and delicate women in silence overpower their torturers, and even the fire is unable to extort from them a groan. …. Behold, the weak sex and fragile age endure to be lacerated in the whole body, and to be burned: not of necessity, for it is permitted them to escape if they wished to do so; but of their own will, because they put their trust in God.    location 129862

For who is so arrogant, who so lifted up, as to forbid me to raise my eyes to heaven? Who can impose upon me the necessity either of worshipping that which I am unwilling to worship, or of abstaining from the worship of that which I wish to worship?    location 129872

{Gal 3:28; Col 3:11}
For God, who produces and gives breath to men, willed that all should be equal, that is, equally matched. He has imposed on all the same condition of living; He has produced all to wisdom; He has promised immortality to all; no one is cut off from His heavenly benefits. For as He distributes to all alike His one light, sends forth His fountains to all, supplies food, and gives the most pleasant rest of sleep; so He bestows on all equity and virtue. In His sight no one is a slave, no one a master; for if all have the same Father, by an equal right we are all children. No one is poor in the sight of God, but he who is without justice; no one is rich, but he who is full of virtues; no one, in short, is excellent, but he who has been good and innocent; no one is most renowned, but he who has abundantly performed works of mercy; no one is most perfect, but he who has filled all the steps of virtue. Therefore neither the Romans nor the Greeks could possess justice, because they had men differing from one another by many degrees, from the poor to the rich, from the humble to the powerful; in short, from private persons to the highest authorities of kings. For where all are not equally matched, there is not equity; and inequality of itself excludes justice,    … Someone will say, Are there not among you some poor, and others rich; some servants, and others masters? Is there not some difference between individuals? There is none; nor is there any other cause why we mutually bestow upon each other the name of brethren, except that we believe ourselves to be equal. For since we measure all human things not by the body, but by the spirit, although the condition of bodies is different, yet we have no servants, but we both regard and speak of them as brothers in spirit, in religion as fellow-servants. Riches also do not render men illustrious, except that they are able to make them more conspicuous by good works. For men are rich, not because they possess riches, but because they employ them on works of justice; and they who seem to be poor, on this account are rich, because they are not in want, and desire nothing. Though, therefore, in lowliness of mind we are on an equality, the free with slaves, and the rich with the poor, nevertheless in the sight of God we are distinguished by virtue. And everyone is more elevated in proportion to his greater justice. For if it is justice for a man to put himself on a level even with those of lower rank, although he excels in this very thing, that he made himself equal to his inferiors; yet if he has conducted himself not only as an equal, but even as an inferior, he will plainly obtain a much higher rank of dignity in the judgment of God.    location 129929

Let us see, therefore, whether justice has any agreement with folly. The just man, he says, if he does not take away from the wounded man his horse, and from the shipwrecked man his plank, in order that he may preserve his own life, is foolish. First of all, I deny that it can in any way happen that a man who is truly just should be in circumstances of this kind; for the just man is neither at enmity with any human being, nor desires anything at all which is the property of another. For why should he take a voyage, or what should he seek from another land, when his own is sufficient for him? Or why should he carry on war, and mix himself with the passions of others, when his mind is engaged in perpetual peace with men? Doubtless he will be delighted with foreign merchandise or with human blood, who does not know how to seek gain, who is satisfied with his mode of living, and considers it unlawful not only himself to commit slaughter, but to be present with those who do it, and to behold it!    location 129996

But it is evident that they who are ignorant of the mystery of man, and who therefore refer all things to this present life, cannot know how great is the force of justice. … But let us grant that the case which the philosopher proposes is possible: what, then, will the just man do, if he shall have met with a wounded man on a horse, or a shipwrecked man on a plank? I am not unwilling to confess he will rather die than put another to death. Nor will justice, which is the chief good of man, on this account receive the name of folly. For what ought to be better and dearer to man than innocence? And this must be the more perfect, the more you bring it to extremity, and choose to die rather than to detract from the character of innocence.    … Therefore he is not a fool who does not even spare himself to prevent injury to another, which is an evil.    location 130043

For what benefit does he who buys a slave bestow upon him, beyond the nourishment with which he supplies him for his own advantage?

for the reward of this work and duty must be expected from God alone; for if you should expect it from man, then that will not be kindness, but the lending of a benefit at interest;   … Cicero says: "Hospitality was rightly praised by Theophrastus.

The last and greatest office of piety is the burying of strangers and the poor; which subject those teachers of virtue and justice have not touched upon at all.

Someone will perhaps say: If I shall do all these things, I shall have no possessions. For what if a great number of men shall be in want, shall suffer cold, shall be taken captive, shall die, since one who acts thus must deprive himself of his property even in a single day, shall I throw away the estate acquired by my own labor or by that of my ancestors, so that after this I myself must live by the pity of others? Why do you so pusillanimously fear poverty, which even your philosophers praise, and bear witness that nothing is safer and nothing more calm than this? That which you fear is a haven against anxieties. Do you not know to how many dangers, to how many accidents, you are exposed with these evil resources?    … Why do you fear to make a frail and perishable good everlasting, or to entrust your treasures to God as their preserver, in which case you need not fear thief and robber, nor rust, nor tyrant?

Nor, however, because offences are removed by bounty, think that a licence is given you for sinning. For they are done away with, if you are bountiful to God because you have sinned; for if you sin through reliance on your bounty, they are not done away with. For God especially desires that men shall be cleansed from their sins, and therefore He commands them to repent. But to repent is nothing else than to profess and to affirm that one will sin no more. Therefore they are pardoned who unawares and incautiously glide into sin; he who sins wilfully has no pardon.  … To this is added, that no one can be without fault as long as he is burthened with a covering of flesh, the infirmity of which is subject to the dominion of sin in a threefold manner--in deeds, in words, and thoughts.    … Therefore even just men, who can refrain from every unjust work, are sometimes, however, overcome by frailty itself, so that they either speak evil in anger, or, at the sight of delightful things, they desire them with silent thought. But if the condition of mortality does not suffer a man to be pure from every stain, the faults of the flesh ought therefore to be done away with by continual bounty.    location 130911

For to use money sparingly, that is, moderately, is a kind of weakness of mind, either of one fearing lest he should be in want, or of one despairing of being able to recover it, or of one incapable of the contempt of earthly things. But, on the other hand, they call him who is not sparing of his property prodigal. For thus they distinguish between the liberal man and the prodigal: that he is liberal who bestows on deserving objects, and on proper occasions, and in sufficient quantities; but that he is prodigal who lavishes on undeserving objects, and when there is no need, and without any regard to his property.

let us sustain and endure the labors of life, by mutual assistance towards each other; nor, however, if we shall have done any good work, let us aim at glory from it. For God admonishes us that the doer of justice ought not to be boastful, lest he should appear to have discharged the duties of benevolence, not so much from a desire of obeying the divine commands, as of pleasing men, and should already have the reward of glory which he has aimed at, and should not receive the recompense of that heavenly and divine reward.    location 131078

Moreover, he must also diligently take care, lest by any fault of his he should at any time make an enemy; and if anyone should be so shameless as to inflict injury on a good and just man, he must bear it with calmness and moderation, and not take upon himself his revenge, but reserve it for the judgment of God.  … not limited to this, that he should not himself inflict injury, but that he should not avenge it when inflicted on himself. For there sits on the judgment-seat a very great and impartial Judge, the observer and witness of all. Let him prefer Him to man;    … Cicero says in those same books respecting Offices: "But if anyone should wish to unravel this indistinct conception of his soul, let him at once teach himself that he is a good man who profits those whom he can, and injures no one unless provoked by injury." Oh how he marred a simple and true sentiment by the addition of two words! For what need was there of adding these words, "unless provoked by injury?" that he might append vice as a most disgraceful tail to a good man    … He said that a good man would inflict injuries if he were provoked: now he must necessarily lose the name of a good man from this very circumstance, if he shall inflict injury. For it is not less the part of a bad man to return an injury than to inflict it. For from what source do contests, from what source do fightings and contentions, arise among men, except that impatience opposed to injustice often excites great tempests? But if you meet injustice with patience, then which virtue nothing can be found more true, nothing more worthy of a man, it will immediately be extinguished, as though you should pour water upon a fire.  … And this restraining of oneself is rightly named patience, which single virtue is opposed to all vices and affections.    location 131141

It remains that I should speak against the pleasures of the five senses,  … The other animals have no pleasure, except the one only which relates to generation. Therefore they use their senses for the necessity of their nature: they see, in order that they may seek those things which are necessary for the preservation of life; they hear one another, and distinguish one another, that they may be able to assemble together; they either discover from the smell, or perceive from the taste, the things which are useful for food; they refuse and reject the things which are useless, they measure the business of eating and drinking by the fullness of their stomach. But the foresight of the most skillful Creator gave to man pleasure without limit, and liable to fall into vice, because He set before him virtue, which might always be at variance with pleasure, as with a domestic enemy.  … But, on the other hand, God gave virtue on this account, that it might subdue and conquer pleasure, and that, when it passed the boundaries assigned to it, it might restrain it within the prescribed limits, lest it should soothe and captivate man with enjoyments, render him subject to its control, and punish him with everlasting death.    location 131185

{Entertainment; Rom 13:13; Nonresistance; Ex 20:13; War}
But when they have eloquently exhorted us to despise earthly things, and have urged us to look up to the heaven, nevertheless they do not despise these public spectacles. Therefore they are both delighted with these, and are gladly present at them; though, since they are the greatest incitement to vices, and have a most powerful tendency to corrupt our minds, they ought to be taken away from us; for they not only contribute in no respect to a happy life, but even inflict the greatest injury. For he who reckons it a pleasure, that a man, though justly condemned, should be slain in his sight, pollutes his conscience as much as if he should become a spectator and a sharer of a homicide which is secretly committed. And yet they call these sports in which human blood is shed. So far has the feeling of humanity departed from the men, that when they destroy the lives of men, they think that they are amusing themselves with sport, being more guilty than all those whose blood-shedding they esteem a pleasure. I ask now whether they can be just and pious men, who, when they see men placed under the stroke of death, and entreating mercy, not only suffer them to be put to death, but also demand it, and give cruel and inhuman votes for their death, not being satiated with wounds nor contented with bloodshed. Moreover, they order them, even though wounded and prostrate, to be attacked again, and their caresses to he wasted with blows, that no one may delude them by a pretended death. They are even angry with the combatants, unless one of the two is quickly slain; and as though they thirsted for human blood, they hate delays. They demand that other and fresh combatants should be given to them, that they may satisfy their eyes as soon as possible. Being imbued with this practice, they have lost their humanity. Therefore they do not spare even the innocent, but practice upon all that which they have learned in the slaughter of the wicked. It is not therefore befitting that those who strive to keep to the path of justice should be companions and sharers in this public homicide. For when God forbids us to kill, He not only prohibits us from open violence, which is not even allowed by the public laws, but He warns us against the commission of those things which are esteemed lawful among men. Thus it will be neither lawful for a just man to engage in warfare, since his warfare is justice itself, nor to accuse anyone of a capital charge, because it makes no difference whether you put a man to death by word, or rather by the sword, since it is the act of putting to death itself which is prohibited. Therefore, with regard to this precept of God, there ought to be no exception at all; but that it is always unlawful to put to death a man, whom God willed to be a sacred animal.    location 131191

Therefore let no one imagine that even this is allowed, to strangle newly-born children, which is the greatest impiety; for God breathes into their souls for life, and not for death. But men, that there may be no crime with which they may not pollute their hands, deprive souls as yet innocent and simple of the light which they themselves have not given. Can anyone, indeed, expect that they would abstain from the blood of others who do not abstain even from their own?  … What are they whom a false piety compels to expose their children? Can they be considered innocent who expose their own offspring as a prey to dogs, and as far as it depends upon themselves, kill them in a more cruel manner than if they had strangled them? Who can doubt that he is impious who gives occasion for the pity of others? For, although that which he has wished should befall the child--namely, that it should be brought up--he has certainly consigned his own offspring either to servitude or to the brothel?   … But truly parricides complain of the scantiness of their means, and allege that they have not enough for bringing up more children; as though, in truth, their means were in the power of those who possess them, or God did not daily make the rich poor, and the poor rich. Wherefore, if anyone on account of poverty shall be unable to bring up children, it is better to abstain from marriage than with wicked hands to mar the work of God.    location 131219

{Entertainment; Rom 13:13}
And I am inclined to think that the corrupting influence of the stage is still more contaminating. For the subject of comedies are the dishonoring of virgins, or the loves of harlots; and the more eloquent they are who have composed the accounts of these disgraceful actions, the more do they persuade by the elegance of their sentiments;    … In like manner, the stories of the tragedians place before the eyes the parricides and incests of wicked kings, and represent tragic crimes. And what other effect do the immodest gestures of the players produce, but both teach and excite lusts? whose enervated bodies, rendered effeminate after the gait and dress of women, imitate unchaste women by their disgraceful gestures. Why should I speak of the actors of mimes, who hold forth instruction in corrupting influences, who teach adulteries while they feign them… What can young men or virgins do, when they see that these things are practiced without shame, and willingly beheld by all? They are plainly admonished of what they can do, and are inflamed with lust, which is especially excited by seeing;  … and not boys only, who ought not to be inured to vices prematurely, but also old men, whom it does not become at their age to sin.    location 131233

What else does the practice of the Circensian games contain but levity, vanity, and madness?

Therefore all spectacles ought to be avoided, not only that no vice may settle in our breasts, which ought to be tranquil and peaceful;   … For the celebrations of the games are festivals in honor of the gods, inasmuch as they were instituted on account of their birthdays, or the dedication of new temples.

For if we think that our children are corrected when we perceive that they repent of their faults, and though we have disinherited and cast them off, we again receive, cherish, and embrace them, why should we despair that the mercy of God our Father may again be appeased by repentance? Therefore He who is at once the Lord and most indulgent Parent promises that He will remit the sins of the penitent, and that He will blot out all the iniquities of him who shall begin afresh to practice righteousness. For as the uprightness of his past life is of no avail to him who lives badly, because the subsequent wickedness has destroyed his works of righteousness, so former sins do not stand in the way of him who has amended his life, because the subsequent righteousness has effaced the stain of his former life.    location 131347

Because in preaching to the Gentiles he was constrained to preach Christianity purely; and if haply even in Judaea he were found [doing so], he cared not. For Peter and they that were with him, because they preached in Jerusalem, when there was great fierceness, of necessity enjoined the observance of the Law but this man was quite at liberty.

Why, then, not being a teacher of the Jews, does he send an Epistle to them? And where were those to whom he sent it? It seems to me in Jerusalem and Palestine. Why then does he send them an Epistle? Just as he baptized, though he was not commanded to baptize. For, he says, 'I was not sent to baptize': not, however, that he was forbidden, but he does it as a subordinate matter. And how could he fail to write to those, for whom he was willing even to become accursed? Accordingly he said, 'Know you that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.' For as yet he was not arrested. Two years then he passed bound, in Rome; then he was set free; then, having gone into Spain, he saw Jews also in like manner; and then he returned to Rome, where also he was slain by Nero.

but it was not so in Judaea. You see indeed, that while in other cities they bring them to the magistrates, and need help from them, and from the Gentiles, here [in Judaea] they took no thought of this, but assemble a Sanhedrim themselves and slay whom they please. Thus in fact they put Stephen to death, thus they beat the Apostles, not taking them before rulers. Thus also they were about to put Paul to death, had not the chief captain thrown himself [upon them]. For this took place while the priests, while the temple, while the ritual, the sacrifices were vet standing.

1. For the expressions, at sundry times and in various manners are the same as in different ways. For I (says He) have multiplied visions, and used similitudes by the ministry of the Prophets. [Hosea 12:10]    location 75864   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 1.

{Heb 1:5; Heb 1:13}
speaks concerning His human nature: "For to which of the angels said He, You are My Son," [Hebrews 1:5], and, Sit on My right hand? [Hebrews 1:13]    location 75867   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 1.

{Phil 4:56; Rom 13:11}
2. Well also said he, at the end of the days, for by this he both stirs them up and encourages them desponding of the future. For as he says also in another place, "The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing [Philippians 4:56], and again, "For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed" [Romans 13:11]: so also here. What then is it which he says? That whoever is spent in the conflict, when he hears of the end thereof, recovers his breath a little, knowing that it is the end indeed of his labors, but the beginning of his rest.    location 75872   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2.

{Heb 1:2}
"In the end of the days," shadows forth some other meaning:-- that when a long time had intervened, when we were on the edge of punishment, when the gifts had failed, when there was no expectation of deliverance, when we were expecting to have less than all-- then we have had more.    location 75878

Hebrews 1:34: Who, (being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power,) when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they, sec     location 75894   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec. 2, sec 

{Jn 1:15; Jn 1:30; Heb 1:4}
Nevertheless the discourse here is not about being called into existence. But just as John says, "He that comes after me, is preferred before me" [John 1:15, 30], that is, higher in honor and esteem; so also here, being made so much better than the angels-- that is, higher in esteem and better and more glorious, by how much He has obtained by inheritance a more excellent name than they. location 75918   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Heb 1:4}
For this Name, God the Word ever had; He did not afterwards obtain it by inheritance; nor did He afterwards become better than the angels, when He had purged our sins; but He was always better, and better without all comparison.    location 75921   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Mt 5:22}
He that calls his brother fool, is in danger (He says) of hellfire. [Matthew 5:22] . . . But if it be so with him who calls a man fool, which seems to be the slightest of all things, and rather mere children's talk; what sentence of punishment will not he incur, who calls him malignant and crafty and envious, and casts at him ten thousand other reproaches?    location 75931   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Mt 25:40; Mt 25:45}
For if he that does [anything] to one of the least, does it to Him [Matthew 25:40], and he that does it not to one of the least does it not to Him [Matthew 25:45], how is it not the same also in the matter of good or evil speaking? He that reviles his brother, reviles God: and he that honors his brother, honors God.    location 75933   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Mt 5:22; Eternal Punishment}
For if here anyone of those ingeniously brought up, should he be cast into prison, speaks of the mere ill odor, and the being laid in darkness, and the being bound with murderers, as more intolerable than any death: think what it is when we are burning with the murderers of the whole world,    location 75958   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Rom 2:6; Rev 22:12; Salvation-Stage Two; Jn 5:28-29}
For it is He Himself who rewards everyone according to his works, and upon these depends our salvation or punishment.    location 75966   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Lk 16:9}
Let us make then to ourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness [Luke 16:9], that is: Let us give alms; let us exhaust our possessions upon them, that so we may exhaust that fire: that we may quench it, that we may have boldness there. . . . But he added also the manner? For saying, of the mammon of unrighteousness, He points out that we must make friends of them by means of our possessions, showing that mere friendship will not protect us, unless we have good works, unless we spend righteously the wealth unrighteously gathered. Moreover, this our discourse, of almsgiving I mean, fits not only the rich, but also the needy.    location 75970   
John Chrysostom, Homily 1 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Mk 12:43-44}
It is therefore possible that a person giving a small sum from small means, should surpass those who have large possessions    location 75974

{Heb 2:14; Eph 2:13}
"Forasmuch then as the children were partakers of blood and flesh, He also Himself likewise took part of the same" [Hebrews 2:14]-- follows up the subject in this passage. For do not regard lightly what is spoken, nor think this merely a slight [matter], His taking on Him our flesh. He granted not this to angels; For truly He takes not hold of angels, but of the seed of Abraham. What is it that he says? He took not on Him an angel's nature, but man's. But what is He takes hold of? He did not (he means) grasp that nature, which belongs to angels, but ours. But why did he not say, "He took on Him," but used this expression, "He takes hold of"? It is derived from the figure of persons pursuing those who turn away from them, and doing everything to overtake them as they flee, and to take hold of them as they are bounding away. For when human nature was fleeing from Him, and fleeing far away [for we were far off-- Ephesians 2:13], He pursued after and overtook us. location 76602   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Heb 2:16}
Moreover he said not of men (simply) "He takes hold," but wishing to exalt them [the Hebrews] and to show that their race is great and honorable, he says, but of the seed of Abraham He takes hold.    location 76615   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Heb 2:17; Heb 2:14-15; Rom 5:10; Atonement}
He was born (he means), was brought up, grew, suffered all things necessary, at last He died. This is, "in all things to be made like His brethren." . . . for this cause did He leave the angels and the other powers, and come down to us, and took hold of us, and wrought innumerable good things. He destroyed Death, He cast out the devil from his tyranny, He freed us from bondage. . . . and He had compassion on us. "To make reconciliation," he says, "for the sins of the people." That He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest. What is "faithful"? True, able. For the Son is a faithful High Priest, able to deliver from their sins those whose High Priest He is. In order then that He might offer a sacrifice able to purify us, for this cause He has become man. Accordingly he added, "in things pertaining to God"--that is, for the sake of things in relation to God. We had become altogether enemies to God,    location 76631   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Heb 2:18}
That is (he would say) He went through the very experience of the things which we have suffered; now He is not ignorant of our sufferings; not only does He know them as God, but as man also He has known them,    location 76637   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 2, sec 

{Heb 2:18}
He suffered much, He knows how to sympathize. And yet God is incapable of suffering: but he describes here what belongs to the Incarnation, . . . He knows what tribulation is; He knows what temptation is, not less than we who have suffered, for He Himself also has suffered. . . . (What then is this, He is able to succor them that are tempted? It is as if one should say, He will stretch forth His hand with great eagerness, He will be sympathizing.)    location 76641

{Heb 2:16; Rom 9:4-5}
3. Since they [the Jews] wished for something great, and to have an advantage over the [converts] from the Gentiles, he shows that they have an advantage in this while he did not hurt those from the Gentiles at all. In what respect now is this? Because of them is the salvation, because He took hold of them first, because from that race He assumed flesh.    location 76642   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 3, sec 

{Heb 2:17; Mt 1:21; Acts 3:26; Acts 13:26}
for, he says, to make "reconciliation for the sins of the people." Why said he not, of the world, instead "of the people"? For He bore away the sins of all. Because thus far his discourse was concerning them [the Hebrews]. Since the angel also said to Joseph, "You shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people." [Matt 1:21] For this too ought to have taken place first, and for this purpose He came, to save them and then through them the rest--although the contrary came to pass. This also the Apostles said at the first, "To you [God] having raised up His Son, sent [Him] to bless you" [Acts 3:26]: and again, "To you was the word of this salvation sent." [Acts 13:26]     location 76650   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 3

{Heb 3:2-6}
As also "Moses in all His house," that is, either among the people, or in the temple. But here he uses the expression "in His house," just as one might say, concerning those in the household; even as some guardian and steward of a household, so was Moses to the people. For that by house he means the people, he added, whose house we are [Heb 3:6]; that is, we are in His creation. . . . If the people were the house and he was of the people, then he certainly was of the household. For so also we are accustomed to say, such a one is of such a person's house. For here he is speaking of a house, not of the temple, for the temple was not constructed by God, but by men. "Whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."  Here again he encourages them to press forward nobly, and not to fall: for we shall be the house of God (he says), as Moses was, if we hold fast our confidence and our rejoicing firm unto the end. He however (he would say) that is distressed in his trials, and who falls, does not glory: he that is ashamed, he that hides himself, has no confidence, he that is perplexed does not glory.    location 76682

{1 Cor 11:30; 1 Cor 5:5; Ps 25:19; Lk 16:25; Salvation-Stage Two}
And happy is he most of all who is punished here, that having put away all his sins, he may depart approved, and pure, and without having to be called to account. And this Paul teaches us when he says, "For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep." [1 Cor 11:30] And again, "I have delivered such a person to Satan." [1 Cor 5:5] And the prophet says, "For she has received of the Lord's hand her sins double" [Isaiah 40:2]; and again David, "Behold mine enemies that they are multiplied above the hairs of my head and [with] an unjust hatred have they hated me: and forgive you all my sins." [Psalm 25:19] And again another: "O Lord, our God, give peace unto us; for You have rendered all things to us again." [Isaiah 26:12] These however are [the words] of one showing that good men receive here the punishments of their sins. . . . But where are the wicked [mentioned] who receive their good things here, and there are utterly punished? Hear Abraham saying to the rich man, "You received good things, and Lazarus evil things." [Luke 16:25] . . . but when we ourselves are afflicted, let us rejoice. For this very thing is paying off the penalty of sins.    location 76728   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 6

{1 Cor 9:26}
Hear what the blessed Paul says, "So fight I, not as one that beats the air." [1 Cor 9:26] Let us consider that our whole life is in combats, and then we shall never seek rest, we shall never feel it strange when we are afflicted: no more than a boxer feels it strange, when he combats. There is another season for repose. By tribulation we must be made perfect.    location 76733   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 7

{1 Cor 10:13}
There has no temptation taken you, it is said, but such as is common to man. [1 Cor 10:13] Let us then pray indeed to God that we may not come into temptation; but if we come into it, let us bear it nobly. For that indeed is the part of prudent men, not to throw themselves upon dangers;  . . . Let us not then lightly cast ourselves upon [dangers], for that is rashness; nor yet, if led into them, and called by circumstances let us give in, for that is cowardice.    location 76739

{Mt 26:41; Mt 16:24}
Christ who commands us to pray that we enter not into temptation [Matthew 26:41], and commands us to take up the cross and follow Him. [Matthew 16:24] For these things are not contradictory, nay they are rather exceedingly in harmony. Do you be so prepared as is a valiant soldier, be continually in your armor, sober, watchful, ever looking for the enemy: do not however breed wars, for this is not [the act] of a soldier but of a mover of sedition.    location 76744

8. There is no persecution now, and God grant there may never be: but there is another war, that of the desire of money, of envy, of the passions. Paul, describing this war, says, We wrestle not against flesh and blood. [Ephesians 6:12] This war is ever at hand. Therefore he wishes us to stand ever armed.    location 76756   
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec.8.

{Eph 6:14; Ps 38:7}
for stand, says he, having your loins girt about, and he added with truth. [Ephesians 6:14] Why with truth? Because lust is a mockery and a lie: wherefore the prophet says, "My loins are filled with mockings." [Psalm 38:7] The thing is not pleasure, but a shadow of pleasure. Having your loins, he says, girt about with truth; that is, with true pleasure, with temperance, with orderly behavior.    location 76760

{Eph 6:17}
therefore he says, the helmet of salvation. [Ephesians 6:17] For the brain is indeed by nature tender, and therefore is covered above with the skull, as with a kind of shell. And it is to us the cause of all things both good and evil, knowing what is fitting, or what is not so.    location 76773

{Eph 6:15}
Yes, and our feet too and our hands need armor, not these hands, nor these feet, but as before, those of the soul-the former by being employed about what is right, the later, that they may walk where they ought.
John Chrysostom, Homily 5 on Hebrews, sec 8

{Heb 3:7-11}
He says that there are three rests: one, that of the Sabbath, in which God rested from His works; the second, that of Palestine, into which when the Jews had entered they would be at rest from their hardships and labors; the third, that which is Rest indeed, the kingdom of Heaven; which those who obtain, do indeed rest from their labors and troubles. Of these three then he makes mention here. . . . And why did he mention the three, when he is treating of the one only? That he might show that the prophet is speaking concerning this one. For he did not speak (he says) concerning the first. For how could he, when that had taken place long before? Nor yet again concerning the second, that in Palestine. For how could he? For he says, They shall not enter into My rest. It remains therefore that it is this third. location 76793

2. But it is necessary also to unfold the history, to make the argument more clear. . . . But being struck with terror, just as if nothing had been done, they said, we wish to go back again into Egypt, for God has brought us out there (it is said) to slay us, with our children and wives. God therefore being angry that they had so quickly cast off the memory of what had been done, swore that generation, which had said these things, should not enter into the Rest; and they all perished in the wilderness. . . . Speaking at a later period, and after these events, after that generation of men, said, "Today, if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts," that you may not suffer the same things which your forefathers did, and be deprived of the Rest; he evidently [said this] as of some [other] rest. . . . What other rest then is there, except the kingdom of Heaven, of which the Sabbath was an image and type?    location 76806   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 2

{Heb 3:12; Salvation-Stage Two}
"Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God." For since the argument from the future is not so persuasive as from the past, he reminds them of the history, in which they had lacked faith. For if your fathers (he says) because they did not hope as they ought to have hoped, suffered these things, much more will you.    location 76817   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 3

{Heb 3:13}
Since to them also is this word addressed: for, Today (he says) is ever, so long as the world lasts.    location 76819   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 3

{Heb 3:13; Prov 18:3}
4. Wherefore exhort you one another daily, while it is called today. That is, edify one another, raise yourselves up: lest the same things should befall you. Lest anyone of you be hardened by the deceitfullness of sin. Do you see that sin produces unbelief? For as unbelief brings forth an evil life, so also a soul, when it has come into a depth of evils, becomes contemptuous [Proverbs 18:3], and having become contemptuous it endures not even to believe, in order thereby to free itself from fear.    location 76822   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 4

{Eph 3:6; Rom 12:5; Eph 5:30}
We have been made partakers of Christ? We partake of Him (he means); we were made One, we and He-- since He is the Head and we the body, fellow-heirs and of the same body; we are one body, of His flesh and of His bones. [Ephesians 3:6; Romans 12:5; Ephesians 5:30]    location 76829   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 4

{Heb 3:14}
"If we hold fast the principle of our subsistence [our English translations say, "the beginning of our confidence"] steadfast unto the end." What is the principle of our subsistence? The faith by which we stand, and have been brought into being and were made to exist,    location 76831  
 John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 4

{Heb 3:14-19; Heb 4:1-2}
[5.] Then he adds (verse 15), "When it is said, Today if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation." This is a transposition, when it is said, "Today if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts." [It must be read thus:] "Let us fear lest a promise being left us of entering into His rest, any of you should seem to come short of it; for to us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them when it is said, Today if you hear His voice" (for "Today" is "at every time"). [ch. 4:1, 2] Then [he adds] "but the word of hearing did not profit them, as they were not mixed by faith with them that heard." How did it not profit? Then wishing to alarm them, he shows the same thing by what he says: "For some when they had heard did provoke, howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses: And with whom was He grieved forty years? Was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? And to whom swear He that they should not enter into His rest, but to them that believed not? So we see, that they could not enter in because of unbelief." [Chap 3:16-19]
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 5


{Heb 3:19; Heb 4:2; Num 14:8-9}
For he said (he repeats), "Today if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation." Of whom does he speak (he says) [as] having been hardened? Of whom [as] not believing? Is it not of the Jews? Now what he says is to this effect. They also heard, as we hear: but no profit came to them. Do not suppose then that by "hearing" what is proclaimed you will be profited; seeing that they also heard, but derived no benefit because they did not believe. Caleb then and Joshua, because they agreed not with those who did not believe, escaped the vengeance that was sent forth against them. And see how admirably he said, not, "They did not agree," but, "they were not mixed" -- that is, they stood apart, but not factiously, when all the others had one and the same mind. location 76844   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 5

{Heb 4:3-5}
[6.] (Chapter 4:3) For "we who have believed," he says, "do enter into rest." From what this is evident, he adds: "as He said, as I have sworn in My wrath, if they shall enter into My rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world." This indeed, is not evidence that we shall enter in, but that they did not enter in. What then? Thus far he aims to show that as that rest does not hinder the speaking of another rest, so neither does this [exclude] that of Heaven. Up to this point then, he wishes to show that they [the Israelites] did not attain to the rest. For because he means this, he says (verse 4, 5), "For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all His works. And in this place again, If they shall enter into My rest." You see how that does not hinder this from being a rest?
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 6

{Heb 4:8}
Today, after so long a time; as it has been said before. But what is it that he means? Seeing then (he means) that some must certainly enter in, and they did not enter in. And that an entrance is proclaimed, and that some must enter in, let us hear from what this is clear. Because after so many years (he says) David again says: Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts [Hebrews 4:8], For if Joshua had given them rest he would not afterward have spoken of another day. It is evident, that he says these things, as of persons who are to attain some recompense.    location 76854   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 

{Heb 4:9}
7. "There remains therefore a rest for the people of God." Whence [does this appear]? From the exhortation, Harden not your hearts:  for if there were no rest, these exhortations would not have been given. Neither would they have been exhorted not to do the same things [with the Jews] lest they should suffer the same things, unless they were about to suffer the same. But how were they who were in possession of Palestine about to suffer the same things [i.e. exclusion from the rest] unless there were some other rest?    location 76859   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec.7.

{Sabbath; Heb 4:9}
And well did he conclude the argument. For he said not "rest" but "Sabbath-keeping;" calling the kingdom Sabbath-keeping, by the appropriate name, and that which they rejoiced in and were attracted by. For as, on the Sabbath He commands to abstain from all evil things; and that those things only which relate to the service of God should be done, which things the priests were wont to accomplish, and whatsoever profits the soul, and nothing else; so also [will it be] then.    location 76862   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 

{Heb 4:10}
[Hebrews 4:10], For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God [did] from His.    location 76866   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 

{Heb 3:12-13}
8. And [he said] Today, that they might never be without hope. Exhort one another daily, he says, [while it is called today,] that is, even if a man have sinned, as long as it is Today, he has hope: let no man then despair so long as he lives. Above all things indeed, he says, let there not be an evil heart of unbelief. [Hebrews 3:12] But even suppose there should be, let no man despair, but let him recover himself; for as long as we are in this world, the Today is in season.    location 76869   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec.8.

{Heb 4:12}
Then, lest any think that they will simply be deprived of rest only, he adds also the punishment, saying [Hebrews 4:12], For the Word of God is quick, and powerful; and sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow: and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Here he is speaking of Hell and of punishment. It pierces (he says) into the secrets of our heart, and cuts asunder the soul. Here it is not the falling of carcasses nor, as there, the being deprived of a country, but of a heavenly kingdom; and being delivered to an everlasting hell, and to undying punishment and vengeance.    location 76873   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 8

{Heb 3:13; 1 Thess 5:14}
[Hebrews 3:13] "But exhort one another." Observe the gentleness and mildness [of the expression]: he said not Rebuke, but Exhort [or Encourage]. Thus we are required to bear ourselves towards those who are straightened by affliction. . . . This he says also in writing to the Thessalonians, Warn them that are unruly [1 Thess 5:14], but in speaking of the feebleminded, not so, but what? Comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men;    location 76879   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec 8

{Heb 3:13; 2 Tim 2:12}
9. Lest any of you, he says, be hardened by the deceitfullness of sin. He means either the deceit of the devil (for it is indeed a deceit, not to look for the things to come, to think that we are without responsibility, and that we shall not pay the penalty for our deeds here, neither will there be a resurrection); or in another sense insensibility [or] despairing is deceit. For to say, 'What is there left? I have sinned once for all, I have no hope of recovering myself," is deceit.    . . . All but saying, He that so loved us, He that counted us worthy of so great things, as to make us His Body, will not suffer us to perish. Let us consider (he says) of what we have been thought worthy: we and Christ are One: let us not then distrust Him. And again, he hints at that which had been said in another place, that If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him. [2 Timothy 2:12] For this is [implied in] We are made partakers, we partake of the same things whereof Christ also partakes.    location 76886   
John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily on Hebrews, sec.9.

{Heb 3:9}

For of Palestine we have not to speak: for they were already in possession of it.

[Romans 6:4] Wherefore, as it is not possible that Christ should be crucified a second time, for that is to put Him to an open shame.    location 77375   
John Chrysostom, Ninth Homily on Hebrews, sec  

{Heb 6:6}
He then that baptizes a second time, crucifies Him again. But what is crucifying afresh? [It is] crucifying over again. For as Christ died on the cross, so do we in baptism, not as to the flesh, but as to sin. Behold two deaths. He died as to the flesh; in our case the old man was buried, and the new man arose, made conformable to the likeness of His death. If therefore it is necessary to be baptized [again ], it is necessary that this same [Christ] should die again. For baptism is nothing else than the putting to death of the baptized, and his rising again.    location 77379   
John Chrysostom, Ninth Homily on Hebrews, sec  

{Heb 6:6}
And he well said, crucifying afresh unto themselves. For he that does this, as having forgotten the former grace, and ordering his own life carelessly, acts in all respects as if there were another baptism.    location 77383

7. What is, having tasted of the heavenly gift? It is, of the remission of sins: for this is of God alone to bestow, and the grace is a grace once for all. What then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Far from it! [Romans 6:12]    location 77385   
John Chrysostom, Ninth Homily on Hebrews, sec. 7.

{Heb 6:6}
But if we should be always going to be saved by grace we shall never be good. For where there is but one grace, and we are yet so indolent, should we then cease sinning if we knew that it is possible again to have our sins washed away? For my part I think not.    location 77387 
John Chrysostom, Ninth Homily on Hebrews, sec.  

{Heb 6:6}
how could he be again baptized? On two grounds then he said that the thing was impossible, and he put the stronger last: first, because he who has been deemed worthy of such [blessings], and who has betrayed all that was granted to him, is not worthy to be again renewed; neither is it possible that [Christ] should again be crucified afresh: for this is to put Him to an open shame. There is not then any second laver: there is not [indeed]. And if there is, there is also a third, and a fourth; for the former one is continually    location 77393

First, of the condemnation of our own sins; For (it is said) mine iniquity have I not hid [Psalm 32:5]; and again, I will confess against myself my lawlessness unto the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my heart. And Declare you at the first your sins, that you may be justified. [Isaiah 43:26] And, The righteous man is an accuser of himself at the first speaking.

And after humbleness of mind, there is need of intense prayers, of many tears, tears by day, and tears by night: for, he says, every night, will I wash my bed, I will water my couch with my tears.

Up to this point he has been applying the type: henceforward he boldly shows him [Melchizedek] to be more glorious than the Jewish realities. But if he who bears a type of Christ is so much better . . . what should one say of the reality?    location 77816

even the Patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the choice portions. Spoils taken in battle are called choice portions. And it cannot be said that he gave them to him as having a part in the war, because (he said) he met him returning from the slaughter of the kings, for he had stayed at home. . . . And not only this; but neither was he of the same dignity with them, but of another race: so that he would not have given tithes to a stranger unless his dignity had been great.

{Free will}
What then? Does nothing depend on God? All indeed depends on God, but not so that our freewill is hindered. 'If then it depend on God,"  (one says), 'why does He blame us?' On this account I said, 'so that our freewill is not hindered.' It depends then on us, and on Him. For we must first choose the good; and then He leads us to His own. He does not anticipate our choice, lest our freewill should be outraged. But when we have chosen, then great is the assistance he brings to us.    location 77847

{Free Will; Rom 9:15-19}
How is it then that Paul says, not of Him who wills, if it depend on ourselves also nor of Him who runs, but of God that shows mercy. [Romans 9:16] In the first place, he did not introduce it as his own opinion, but inferred it from what was before him and from what had been put forward [in the discussion]. For after saying, It is written, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion [Romans 9:15], he says, It follows then that it is not of Him who wills, nor of Him who runs, but of God that shows mercy. You will say then unto me, why does He yet find fault? [Romans 9:16-19] And secondly the other explanation may be given, that he speaks of all as His, whose the greater part is. For it is ours to choose and to wish; but God's to complete and to bring to an end. Since therefore the greater part is of Him, he says all is of Him, speaking according to the custom of men.    location 77851

For so we ourselves also do. I mean for instance: we see a house well built, and we say the whole is the Architect's [doing], and yet certainly it is not all his, but the workmen's also, and the owner's, who supplies the materials, and many others', but nevertheless since he contributed the greatest share, we call the whole his.    location 77857   
John Chrysostom, Twelfth Homily on Hebrews, sec .

{Rom 9:15-19}
says, not of Him who wills, nor of Him who runs, but of God that shows mercy. And herein he establishes two great truths: one, that we should not be lifted up: even should you run (he would say), even should you be very earnest, do not consider that the well doing is your own. For if you obtain not the impulse that is from above, all is to no purpose. Nevertheless that you will attain that which you earnestly strivest after is very evident; so long as you run, so long as you will. He did not then assert this, that we run in vain, but that, if we think the whole to be our own, if we do not assign the greater part to God, we run in vain. For neither has God willed that the whole should be His, lest He should appear to be crowning us without cause: nor again our's, lest we should fall away to pride. . . . 
what should we do if the whole depended on us?    location 77866

If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood; (for under it the people have received the law?' ) what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

But if Christ comes later, and takes a different type, as that of His priesthood, it is evident that it is because those were imperfect. For (he would say) let us suppose for argument's sake, that all has been fulfilled, and that there is nothing imperfect in the priesthood.

Harlots however stand in front of their house, and the charge against them is that they sell their body for money. . . .

The Priest of God is Standing, offering up the prayer of all: and are you laughing, having no fears? And while he is offering up the prayers in trembling for you, do you despise all? Do you not hear the Scripture saying, "Woe, you despisers!" (cf. Acts 13:41 from Habakkuk 1:5); do you not shudder? do you not humble yourself? Even when you enter a royal palace, you order yourself in dress, and look, and gait, and all other respects: and here where there is the true Palace, and things like those of heaven, do you laugh? . . . This my discourse is addressed to women also, who in the presence of their husbands indeed do not dare readily to do this, and even if they do it, it is not at all times, but during a season of relaxation, but here they do it always. Tell me, O woman, do you cover your head and laugh, sitting in the Church? Did you come in here to make confession of sins, to fall down before God, to entreat and to supplicate for the transgressions you have wretchedly committed, and do you do this with laughter?

Hebrews 9:15-18 And for this cause He is the Mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament, they which are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator lives.

So in this case also: I will that where I am, Christ says, they also may be. [John 17:24] And again of the disinherited, hear Him saying, I pray not for all, but for them that believe in me through their word.

For instance; God is said to be in Heaven. Wherefore? Not because He is confined by space, far from it, nor as having left the earth destitute of His presence, but by His relation to and intimacy with the angels. If then we also are near to God, we are in Heaven. For what care I about Heaven when I see the Lord of Heaven, when I myself have become a Heaven?

Does not the performance seem to us to be so frightful, that we are not even willing to look at it, but are terrified and tremble at the very sight?

But since later, there were many transgressions, with reason He then appeared: which he expresses in another place also, Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.

It had been appointed (he says) unto men once to die. This then is [the meaning of] He died once, for all.  . . . For the tyranny of death, and death indeed, is when he who dies is never more allowed to return to life.

And what is [the meaning of] He bare the sins? Just as in the Oblation we bear up our sins and say, Whether we have sinned voluntarily or involuntarily, do you forgive, that is, we make mention of them first, and then ask for their forgiveness. So also was it done here. Where has Christ done this? Hear Himself saying, And for their sakes I sanctify Myself. [John 17:19] Lo! He bore the sins. He took them from men, and bore them to the Father; not that He might determine anything against them [mankind], but that He might forgive them.    location 78552

You see again the superabundance [of his proofs]? This sacrifice (he says) is one; whereas the others were many: therefore they had no strength, because they were many. For, tell me, what need of many, if one had been sufficient? So that their being many, and offered continually, proves that they [the worshipers] were never made clean. For as a medicine, when it is powerful and productive of health, and able to remove the disease entirely, effects all after one application; as, therefore, if being once applied it accomplishes the whole, it proves its own strength in being no more applied, . . . and this is its business, to be no more applied; whereas if it is applied continually, this is a plain proof of its not having strength. For it is the excellence of a medicine to be applied once, and not often.    location 78574

What is, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself? What is this putting away? It is making contemptible.

6. What then? Do not we offer every day? We offer indeed, but making a remembrance of His death, and this [remembrance] is one and not many. How is it one, and not many? Inasmuch as that [Sacrifice] was once for all offered, [and] carried into the Holy of Holies. This is a figure of that [sacrifice] and this remembrance of that. For we always offer the same, not one sheep now and tomorrow another, but always the same thing: so that the sacrifice is one. And yet by this reasoning, since the offering is made in many places, are there many Christs? But Christ is one everywhere, being complete here and complete there also, one Body.  As then while offered in many places, He is one body and not many bodies; so also [He is] one sacrifice.    location 78590

But since I have mentioned this sacrifice, I wish to say a little in reference to you who have been initiated; little in quantity, but possessing great force and profit, for it is not our own, but the words of Divine Spirit . What then is it? Many partake of this sacrifice once in the whole year, others twice; others many times. Our word then is to all; not to those only who are here, but to those also who are settled in the desert. For they partake once in the year, and often indeed at intervals of two years. What then? Which shall we approve? Those [who receive] once [in the year]? Those who [receive] many times? Those who [receive] few times? Neither those [who receive] once, nor those [who receive] often, nor those [who receive] seldom, but those [who come] with a pure conscience, from a pure heart, with an irreproachable life.    location 78597

[8.] These things have been given to the holy. This the Deacon also proclaims when he calls on the holy; even by this call searching the faults of all. For as in a flock, where many sheep indeed are in good health, but many are full of the scab, it is needful that these should be separated from
the healthy; so also in the Church: since some sheep are healthy, and some diseased, by this voice he separates the one from the other, the priest [I mean] going round on all sides by this most awful cry, and calling and drawing on the holy. For it is not possible that a man should know the things of his neighbor, (for "what man," he says, "knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?"-1 Cor 2:11): he utters this voice after the whole sacrifice has been completed, that no person should come to the spiritual fountain carelessly and in a chance way. For in the case of the flock also (for nothing prevents us from again using the same example), the sickly ones we shut up within, and keep them in the dark, and give them different food, not permitting them to partake either of pure air, or of simple grass, or of the fountain outside. In this case then also this voice is instead of fetters. You cannot say, 'I did not know, I was not aware that danger attends the matter.' Nay surely Paul too especially testified this. But will you say, 'I never read it'? This is not an apology, but even an accusation. Dost
thou come into the Church every day and yet art ignorant of this? However, that you mayest not have even this excuse to offer, for this cause, with a loud voice, with an awful cry, like some herald lifting up.

Is he a slave? Is he a thief? Is he one of wicked manners? And yet, those contests for prizes are not of the soul nor yet of good morals, but of strength and the body. If then where there is exercise of bodies, much examination is made about character, how much rather here, where the soul is alone the combatant.    location 78627

[Isaiah 1:12] How then did He Himself enjoin it? In condescension. For as Paul says, I would that all men were even as I myself [1 Cor 7:7], in respect of continence, and again says, I will that the younger women marry, bear children [1 Timothy 5:14]; and lays down two wills, yet the two are not his own, although he commands; but the one indeed is his own, and therefore he lays it down without reasons; while the other is not his own, though he wishes it, and therefore it is added with a reason. For having previously accused them, because they had waxed wanton against Christ [1 Timothy 5:11], he then says, I will that the younger women marry, bear children. [1 Timothy 5:14] So in this place also it was not His leading will that the sacrifices should be offered. For, as He says, I wish not the death of the sinner, as that he should turn unto [Me] and live [Ezekiel 33:11]: and in another place He says that He not only wished, but even desired this: and yet these are contrary to each other: for intense wishing is desire. How then do you not wish? How do you in another place desire, which is a sign of vehement wishing? So is it in this case also.    location 78679

They were said under the Old [Covenant], where there was much account made of wealth, where there was great contempt of poverty, where the one was a curse and the other a blessing.

But whence [is it shown] that He did this [Creation] even by a Word? For reason suggests nothing of this kind; but on the contrary, that the things which appear are [formed] out of things which appear. Therefore the philosophers expressly say that 'nothing comes out of things that are not' being sensual [Jude 19], and trusting nothing to Faith.    location 79135   
John Chrysostom, Twenty-second Homily on Hebrews, sec

Abel honored God, and died because he honored Him: and has not yet attained to a resurrection. But his readiness is manifest, and his part has been done, . . . And Abel did these things rightly looking to no man. For to whom could he look, when he so honored God? To his father and his mother? But they had outraged Him in return for His benefits. To his brother then? But he also had dishonored [God]. So that by himself he sought out what was good. And he that is worthy of so great honor, what does he suffer? He is put to death.    location 79157

You who have both prophets and examples, and encouragements innumerable, and signs and miracles accomplished? Hence that was faith indeed. For what miracles did Abel see, that he might believe he should have any recompense of good things? Did he not choose virtue from Faith alone? . . . What is, and by it he being dead yet speaks? . . . 'The influence coming from him is great, he means, and he yet speaks; that is, [Cain] slew him, but he did not with him slay his glory and memory. Abel is not dead; therefore neither shall you die. . . .   For he who encourages others to be righteous, speaks. For no speech avails so much, as that man's suffering.    location 79169

This man [Enoch] displayed greater faith than Abel. How (you ask)? Because, although he
came after Abel, yet what befell [Abel] was sufficient to guide him back. How? God foreknew that [Abel] would be killed. For He said to Cain: "You have sinned: do not add thereto." Honored by him, He did not protect him. And yet neither did this throw him [Enoch] into indifference. He said not to himself, 'What need of toils and dangers? Abel honored God, yet God did not protect him. For what advantage had he that was departed, from the punishment of his brother?"  . . . He neither said nor thought anything of this kind, but passing beyond all these things, he knew that if there is a God, certainly there is a Rewarder also: although as yet they knew nothing of a resurrection, nor had they any examples to look to. This same thing then made [Enoch] well-pleasing [to God], namely, that he received nothing. For he knew that [God] is a rewarder.    location 79180

But many ask whither Enoch was translated, and why he was translated, and why he did not die, neither he nor Elijah, and, if they are still alive, how they live, and in what form. But to ask these things is superfluous.

so also God, to speak as it were after the manner of men, did not continue resolute, but immediately showed that death is done away. And first He allows death to happen, wishing to terrify the father through the son: For wishing to show that the sentence is truly fixed, He subjected to this punishment not wicked men at once, but him even who was well-pleasing, I mean, the blessed Abel; and almost immediately after him, He translated Enoch. . . . Moreover, He did not raise the former, lest they should immediately grow bold; but He translated the other being yet alive:    location 79199

For as to those who diligently seek Him, He is a rewarder, so to those who seek Him not, the contrary. . . . For instance, suppose that any among us has lost his son, what do we not do? What land, what sea do we not make the circuit of? Do we not reckon money, and houses, and everything else as secondary to the finding him? And should we find him, we cling to him, we hold him fast, we do not let him go. . . .

For inasmuch as another King was about to arise from Ephraim, therefore it is said, And he bowed himself upon the top of his staff. That is, even though he was now an old man, he bowed himself to Joseph, showing the obeisance of the whole people which was to be [directed] to him. And this indeed had already taken place, when his brethren "bowed down" to him: but it was afterwards to come to pass through the ten tribes.   location 79687

Joseph heard that [God] had made a promise to Abraham, that He had engaged His word to you and to your seed will I give this land; and though in a strange land, and not yet seeing the engagement fulfilled, but never faltered even so, but so believed as even to speak of the Exodus, and to give commandment concerning his bones.

Therefore also he goes on to increase the strangeness of what he says by enumerating even women that were harlots, and widows.

And yet the Scripture says, that when he heard, he was afraid [Ex 2:14], and for this cause provided for safety by flight, and stole away, and secretly withdrew himself; and afterwards he was exceedingly afraid. Observe the expressions with care: he said, "not fearing the wrath of the king," with reference to his even presenting himself again.

these subjects in vain?

with "gold" (1 Timothy 2:9), nor with "pearls," nor with "costly array," will he not indeed say to himself will he not indeed say to himself, when he sees her in her little room, putting on these things, and arranging them beautifully, Why is my wife staying within in her little room? Why is she so slow? Why is she putting on her golden ornaments? Where has she to go to? Into the Church? For what purpose? To hear? 'not with costly array'; will he not smile, will he not burst out into laughter? . . . But, you say, I do not please my husband [if I dress plainly]. It is not your husband you wish to please, but the multitude of poor women; or rather not to please them, but to make them pine [with envy], . . . For that it is not your husband whom you wish to please, and for this reason you deck yourself out, you make plain to all by what you yourself do. For as soon as you have passed over the threshold of your chamber, you immediately put off all, both the robes, and the golden ornaments, and the pearls; and at home of all places you do not wear them. . . .

For, tell me, for what other reason do you suppose women are so weak? Is it from their sex only? By no means: but from their way of living, and their bringing up. For their avoiding exposure, their inactivity, their baths, their ointments, their multitude of perfumes, the delicate softness of their couches, makes them in the end such as they are. . . . This is true, [appears from the fact that] women brought up in the country are stronger than citizens of towns: and they would overcome many such in wrestling.

For in the one case he uses the drain without harm to himself: but in the other he generates innumerable diseases. . . . Do you wish to nourish the body?

You had one talent. You ought then to have brought one besides, and to have doubled the talent. If you had brought one in addition, you would not have been blamed. . . . For neither did He say to him who brought the two, "Why have you not brought five? But He accounted him of the same worth with him who brought the five. Why? Because he gained as much as he had.

For as regards their characters, no one would be harmed [thereby]. How is this? Both because their characters are manifest to all, and also because though he were ten thousand times as wicked, he will never teach what is wicked. But as respects Faith, [the evil] is not manifest to all, and the wicked [ruler] will not shrink from teaching it.    location 80900

through the blood of the everlasting covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ, [Hebrews 13:21] make you perfect in every good work, to do His will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight." . . . For that is made perfect which having a beginning is afterwards completed.    location 80943

For [Hebrews 13:23] know you, he says, that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. Set at liberty, he says; from whence? I suppose he had been cast into prison: or if not this, that he was sent away from Athens.    location 80948

6. Do you see how he shows that virtue is born neither wholly from God, nor yet from ourselves alone? First by saying, make you perfect in every good work; You have virtue indeed, he means, but need to be made complete. What is good work and word? So as to have both life and doctrines right.    location 80951

But how does Grace come to be with us? If we do not do despite to the benefit, if we do not become indolent in regard to the Gift. And what is the grace? Remission of sins, Cleansing: this is with us. For who (he means) can keep the Grace despitefully, and not destroy it? For instance; He freely forgave you your sins. How then shall the Grace be with you, whether it be the good favor or the effectual working of the Spirit? If you draw it to you by good deeds.    location 80964

{1 Thess 5:19}
For as a ship sailing with favorable winds is neither to be hindered nor sunk, so long as it enjoys a prosperous and steady breeze, . . . so too a soul strengthened by the Divine Spirit, is far above all the billows of this life, and more strongly than the ship, cuts the way bearing on to Heaven, since it is not sent along by wind, but has all the pure sails filled by the
Paraclete Himself: and He casts out of our minds all that is slackened and relaxed. For as the wind if it fall upon a slackened sail, would have no effect; so neither does the Spirit endure to continue in a slack soul; but there is need of much tension, of much vehemence, so that our mind may be on fire, and our conduct under all circumstances on the stretch, and braced up. For instance, when we pray, we ought to do it with much intentness, stretching forth the soul toward Heaven, not with cords, but with great earnestness. Again when we do works of mercy, we have need of intentness, lest by
any means, thought for our household, and care for children, and anxiety about wife, and fear of poverty entering in, should slacken our sail.  location 80977

{Mt 19:1-2; Jn 1:28; Mt 9:9; Matthew, Apostle; Twelve Apostles}
He came to the borders of Judaea, and not to the middle of it, but, as it were, to the outermost parts, where great multitudes followed Him. These He healed at "the borders of Judaea beyond Jordan,"—where baptism had been given. But you will observe the difference between the crowds who simply followed, and Peter and the others who "gave up everything" and followed. Likewise, Matthew, who arose and followed him. He did not simply follow, but "having arisen;" For "having arisen" is an important addition. There are always those, then, who follow like the great multitudes, who have not "arisen" that they may follow, nor have given up all that was theirs formerly. But few are they who have arisen and followed, who also, in the regeneration, shall sit on twelve thrones.   location 182756 
Origen, Commentary on Matthew, bk. 14, ch. 15.

Kinuko, I wonder if there is some other meaning or connotation to anistemi than what we realize today. Origen sees something significant in the word—beyond "having arisen." I notice that this word is used about 100 times in the LXX, but I don't have time right now to check out all the uses to see if there is another meaning.

STRONGS NT 450: anistemi 

I. Transitively, in the present 1 aorist and future active, to cause to rise, raise up :
a. properly, of one lying down: Acts 9:41.
b. to raise up from death: John 6:39f, 44, 54; Acts 2:32; Acts 13:34 (so in Greek writings).
c. to raise up, cause to be born: 
 II. Intransitively, in the perfect pluperfect and 2 aorist active, and in the middle;
1. to rise, stand up; used a. of persons lying down (on a couch or bed): Mark 1:35; Mark 5:42; Luke 8:55; Luke 11:7; Acts 9:34, 40. of persons lying on tht ground: Mark 9:27; Luke 17:19; Luke 22:46; Acts 9:6.
b. of persons seated: Luke 4:16; Matthew 26:62; Mark 14:60; Acts 23:9.
c. **of those who leave a place to go elsewhere: Matthew 9:9; Mark 2:14; ( RG); Luke 4:38; Luke 23:1; Acts 9:30. Hence, of those who prepare themselves for a journey (German sichaufmachen): Mark 7:24; Mark 10:1; Luke 1:39; Luke 15:18, 20; Acts 10:20; Acts 22:10. In the same way the Hebrew ) is put before verbs of going, departing, etc., according to the well known oriental custom to omit nothing contributing to the full pictorial delineation of an action or event; hence, formerly  were sometimes incorrectly said to be redundant; cf. Winer's Grammar, 608 (565). ??ast??a? ?p? to rise up from something, i. e. from what one has been doing while either sitting or prostrate on the ground: Luke 22:45.
*Brother David, umm...I am not quite sure about Origen's interpretation on this verb in this context. It might be true but it might also be due to his vivid & (too much??) lively imagination:)

{Heb 11:22; Ps 24:1; Deut 34:6; Peter; Paul; John; Thomas}
Tell me, are not the bones of Moses himself laid in a strange land? And those of Aaron, of Daniel, of Jeremiah? And as to those of the Apostles we do not know where those of most of them are laid. For of Peter indeed, and Paul, and John, and Thomas, the sepulchers are well known; but those of the rest, being so many, have nowhere become known. Let us not therefore lament at all about this, nor be so little-minded. For wherever we may be buried, the earth is the Lord's and all that therein is. [Psalm 24:1]    location 79704
